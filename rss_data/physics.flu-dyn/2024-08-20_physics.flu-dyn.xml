      <title>A Workflow for Utilizing OpenFOAM Data Structure in Physics-Informed Deep Learning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel methodology for integrating physics-informed loss functions into deep learning models using OpenFOAM's comprehensive data structures. Leveraging the robust and flexible capabilities of OpenFOAM's data structure for handling complex geometries and boundary conditions, it is demonstrated how to construct detailed loss functions that accurately embed physics constraints and potentially enhance the training and performance of neural networks in handling industrial-level complicated geometry for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The present work primarily focuses on the 1D Burger equation to showcase the detailed procedure of constructing initial loss, boundary loss, and residual loss. While the computational geometry employed here is relatively simple, the procedure is sufficiently general to illustrate its applicability to more complex computational domains. The results show the trained operator former (OFormer) neural network can successfully predict the simulation results subject to the OpenFOAM'data structure composed loss. This framework potentially opens new avenues for using deep learning to tackle complex industrial simulation challenges, promising significant advancements in the accuracy and practicality of CFD applications.</description>

      <title>Comparing two different types of stochastic parametrisation in geophysical flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of stochastic variations in bathymetry on the solutions of the thermal quasigeostrophic (TQG) equations. These stochastic perturbations generate a variety of different types of ensemble spread in the solution behaviour whilst also preserving the deterministic Lie Poisson structure and Casimir conservation laws. We numerically compare the solution sensitivity, to another type of structure-preserving stochastic perturbation where instead of bathymetry, the velocity is stochastically perturbed.</description>

      <title>Interface Dynamics at a Four-fluid Interface during Droplet Impact on a Two-Fluid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interfacial dynamics involved in the impact of a droplet on a liquid-liquid system, which involves the impingement of an immiscible core liquid drop from a vertical separation onto an interfacial shell liquid layer floating on a host liquid bath. The dynamics have been studied for a wide range of impact Weber numbers and two different interfacial shell liquids of varying volumes. The core drop, upon impact, dragged the interfacial liquid into the host liquid, forming an interfacial liquid column with an air cavity inside the host liquid bath. The dynamics is resolved into cavity expansion and rapid contraction, followed by thinning of the interfacial liquid. The interplay of viscous dissipation, interfacial pull, and core drop inertia influenced the necking dynamics. The viscous dissipation increases with the thickness of the interfacial layer, which depends on its volume and lateral spread over the water. The necking dynamics transitioned from inertia-dominated deep seal closure at higher spread, lower interfacial film volumes, and higher Weber numbers, into inertia-capillary dominated deep seal closure with an increase in film volumes, decrease in the spread of the interfacial fluid or decrease in Weber number, and finally transitioned into a no seal closure at high volumes, low spread, and low Weber numbers.</description>

      <title>A versatile multilayer liquid-liquid encapsulation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Generating multi-layer cargo using conventional methods is challenging. We hypothesize that incorporating a Y-junction compound droplet generator to encase a target core inside a second liquid can circumvent the kinetic energy dependence of the impact-driven liquid-liquid encapsulation technique, enabling minimally restrictive multi-layer encapsulation.
  Experiments: Stable wrapping is obtained by impinging a compound droplet (generated using Y-junction) on an interfacial layer of another shell-forming liquid floating on a host liquid bath, leading to double-layered encapsulation. The underlying dynamics of the liquid-liquid interfaces are captured using high-speed imaging. To demonstrate the versatility of the technique, we used various liquids as interfacial layers, including magnetoresponsive oil-based ferrofluids. Moreover, we extended the technique to triple-layered encapsulation by overlaying a second interfacial layer atop the first floating interfacial layer.
  Findings: The encapsulating layer(s) effectively protects the water-soluble inner core (ethylene glycol) inside the water bath. A non-dimensional experimental regime is established for successful encapsulation in terms of the impact kinetic energy, interfacial layer thickness, and the viscosity ratio of the interfacial layer and the outer core liquid. Using selective fluorescent tagging, we confirm the presence of individual shell layers wrapped around the core, which presents a promising pathway to visualize the internal morphology of final encapsulated droplets.</description>

      <title>A new temperature evolution equation that enforces thermodynamic vapour-liquid equilibrium in multiphase flows -- application to CO2 modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for numerically simulating the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The framework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of fluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in proposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which simplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for two-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the conventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient solution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is introduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from the UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid flow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating depressurization processes.</description>

      <title>Potential for damage to fruits during transport through cross-section constrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fruit preparations are used in various forms in the food industry. For example, they are used as an ingredient in dairy products such as yogurt with added fruit. The dispersed fruit pieces can be described as soft particles with viscoelastic material behavior. The continuous phase is represented by fluids with complex flow behavior depending on the formulation. Characterization has shown that this can be described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. Since damage to fruit pieces is undesirable in industrial transport processes, the potential for damage to fruit pieces during transport of pipes in cross-sectional constrictions is analyzed. The analysis is performed numerically using the homogenized lattice Boltzmann method and validated by an experiment on industrial fruit preparations at pilot plant scale. The results show a strong dependence of the damage potential on the (local) Metzner-Reed Reynolds number.</description>

      <title>Particulate Reshapes Surface Jet Dynamics Induced by a Cavitation Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid jet formations on water surfaces serve as a cornerstone in diverse scientific disciplines, underpinning processes in climatology, environmental sciences, and human health issues. Traditional models predominantly focus on pristine conditions, an idealisation that overlooks common environmental irregularities such as the presence of particulate matter on water surfaces. To address this shortfall, our research examines the dynamic interactions between surface particulate matter and cavitation bubbles using floating spheres and spark bubbles. We unveil five novel jet modes, charting a new trajectory away from classical models and demonstrating the enhanced variability in jet dynamics. We observe that particulates significantly lower the energy threshold for jet formation, showing enhanced sensitivity to the presence of particulates. The phase diagram and analyses illustrate how the interplay between the dimensionless spark bubble depth and the dimensionless chasing time between water and particulate influences the jet modes development, from singular streams to complex cavity forms. These insights not only advance our understanding of jet formation, but also unlock the potential for refined jet manipulation across a broad range of physical, environmental, and medical applications.</description>

      <title>The near-wall layer at high $Re_\tau$ is part of the outer flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of velocity fluctuations near a wall has long fascinated the turbulence community, because the prevalent theoretical framework of an attached-eddy hierarchy appears to predict infinite intensities as the Reynolds number tends to infinity. Although an unbounded infinite limit is not a problem in itself, it raises the possibility of unfamiliar phenomena when the Reynolds number is large, and has motivated attempts to avoid it. We review the subject and point to possible pitfalls stemming from uncritical extrapolation from low Reynolds numbers, or from an over-simplification of the multiscale nature of turbulence. It is shown that large attached eddies dominate the high-Reynolds-number regime of the near-wall layer, and that they behave differently from smaller-scale ones. In that limit, the near-wall layer is controlled by the outer flow, the large-scale fluctuations reduce to turbulent layers modulated by a variable friction velocity, and the kinetic-energy peak is substituted by a deeper structure with a secondary outer maximum. The friction velocity is then not necessarily the best velocity scale. While the near-wall energy peak probably becomes unbounded in wall units, it tends to zero when expressed in terms of the outer velocity.</description>

      <title>Temperature jump coefficients in polyatomic gas with strong translational/internal non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature jump problem in polyatomic gas flow with translational/internal non-equilibrium is investigated, where the internal temperature is excited by volumetric heating, while the translational temperature is heated via the inelastic translational-internal energy relaxation. In the near-continuum flow regime, analytical temperature profiles are derived, based on which the first and second temperature jump coefficients are extracted from the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Analytical expressions for temperature jump coefficients are fitted over a wide range of inelastic collision number and accommodation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Inertial Focusing of Spherical Particles: The Effects of Rotational Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of cells and particles based on their transport properties in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications in biology and medicine. Neutrally buoyant particles transported in microfluidic channels, migrate laterally towards stable locations. However, the effect of the particle and flow properties on these focusing positions remain largely unknown. We conduct large scale simulations with dissipative particle dynamics, demonstrating that freely moving particles exhibit significant differences in their focusing patterns from particles that are prevented from rotation. In circular pipes, we observe drastic changes in rotating versus non-rotating focusing positions. We demonstrate that rotation-induced lateral lift force is significant, unlike previously believed, and is linearly dependent on the rotation magnitude. A simple phenomenological explanation extending existing theories is presented, that agrees well with our numerical findings. For flows in square ducts, we report four face-centered stable positions for the rotating particles, in accordance with experimental studies. However, the non-rotating particles stay scattered on a concentric one-dimensional annulus, thus revealing qualitatively different behavior with respect to the free ones. Our findings suggest new designs for micro-particle and cell sorting in microfluidics devices.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-driven coalescence of two droplets undergoing freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the evaporation-induced coalescence of two droplets undergoing freezing by conducting numerical simulations employing the lubrication approximation. When two sessile drops undergo freezing in close vicinity over a substrate, they interact with each other through the gaseous phase and the simultaneous presence of evaporation/condensation. In an unsaturated environment, the evaporation flux over the two volatile sessile drops is asymmetric, with lower evaporation in the region between the two drops. This asymmetry in the evaporation flux generates an asymmetric curvature in each drop, which results in a capillary flow that drives the drops closer to each other, eventually leading to their coalescence. This capillary flow, driven by evaporation, competes with the upward movement of the freezing front, depending on the relative humidity in the surrounding environment. We found that higher relative humidity reduces the evaporative flux, delaying capillary flow and impeding coalescence by restricting contact line motion. For a constant relative humidity, the substrate temperature governs the coalescence phenomenon, and resulting condensation can accelerate this process. Interestingly, lower substrate temperatures are observed to facilitate faster propagation of the freezing front, which, in turn, restricts coalescence.</description>

      <title>Shape inference in three-dimensional steady state supersonic flows using ODIL and JAX-Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for inferring the shape of a solid obstacle and its flow field in three-dimensional, steady state supersonic flows. The method combines the optimization of a discrete loss (ODIL) technique with the automatically differentiable JAX-Fluids computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to study joint reconstruction of flow field and obstacle shape. ODIL minimizes the discrete residual of the governing partial differential equation (PDE) by gradient-descent-based algorithms. The ODIL framework inherits the characteristics of the chosen numerical discretizations of the underlying PDE, including their consistency and stability. The discrete residuals and their automatic differentiation gradients are computed by the JAX-Fluids solver which provides nonlinear shock-capturing schemes and level-set based immersed solid boundaries. We test the approach on challenging inverse problems, including the shape inference of a solid obstacle in three-dimensional steady state supersonic flow. We show that the nonlinear shock-capturing discretization in combination with the level-set based interface representation allows for accurate inference of the obstacle shape and its flow field. The proposed approach opens new avenues for solving complex inverse problems in supersonic aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>GSIS-ALE for moving boundary problems in rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale rarefied gas flows with moving boundaries pose significant challenges to the numerical simulation, where the primary difficulties involve robustly managing the mesh movement and ensuring computational efficiency across all flow regimes. Build upon recent advancements of the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), this paper presents an efficient solver to simulate the large displacement of rigid-body in rarefied gas flows. The newly developed solver utilizes a dual time step method to solve the mesoscopic kinetic and macroscopic synthetic equations alternately, in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework. Additionally, the overset mesh is used and the six degree-of-freedom rigid body dynamics equation is integrated to track the motion of solids. Four moving boundary problems encompassing a wide range of flow velocities and gas rarefaction are simulated, including the periodic pitching of airfoil, particle motion in lid-driven cavity flow, two-body separation in supersonic flow, and three-dimensional lunar landing, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the GSIS in handling multi-scale moving boundary problems within an overset framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When numerically computing high Reynolds number cavity flow, it is known that by formulating the Navier-Stokes equations using the stream function and vorticity as unknown functions, it is possible to reproduce finer flow structures. Although numerical computations applying methods such as the finite difference method are well known, to the best of our knowledge, there are no examples of applying particle-based methods like the SPH method to this problem. Therefore, we applied the SPH method to the Navier-Stokes equations, formulated with the stream function and vorticity as unknown functions, and conducted numerical computations of high Reynolds number cavity flow. The results confirmed the reproduction of small vortices and demonstrated the effectiveness of the scheme using the stream function and vorticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1402.5139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate and comprehensive numerical solution to the parabolic free boundary problem arising from thin film flow with both velocity and temperature distribution at large Reynolds numbers is obtained using a modified Keller box method. A detailed numerical solution scheme is presented to establish the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the draining film flow. A solution is obtained for selecting representative values for the basic parameters of heat transfer in the flow of a cold two-dimensional draining sheet over a hot horizontal cylinder. These indicate the underlying features of developing film thickness, velocity, and temperature distribution. Good agreement with the approximations is obtained, providing basic confirmation of the validity of the numerical results presented. Numerical solutions, supplemented with parameter values associated with specified configurations and operating conditions, can be readily invoked to establish the details of engineering practice.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic waves on a rotating sphere under a non-Malkus field: I. Continuous spectrum and its ray-theoretical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) linear waves at the surface of a rotating sphere are studied as a model to imitate the outermost layer of the Earth's core or the solar tachocline. This thin conducting layer is permeated by a toroidal magnetic field the magnitude of which depends only on the latitude. The Malkus background field, which is proportional to the sine of the colatitude, provides two well-known groups of branches; on one branch, retrograde Alfv\'en waves gradually become fast magnetic Rossby (MR) waves as the field amplitude decreases, and on the other, prograde Alfv\'en waves undergo a gradual transition into slow MR waves. In the case of non-Malkus fields, we demonstrate that the associated eigenvalue problems can yield a continuous spectrum instead of Alfv\'en and slow MR discrete modes. The critical latitudes attributed to the Alfv\'en resonance eliminate these discrete eigenvalues and produce an infinite number of singular eigenmodes. The theory of slowly varying wave trains in an inhomogeneous magnetic field shows that a wave packet related to this continuous spectrum propagates toward a critical latitude corresponding to the wave and is eventually absorbed there. The expected behaviour whereby the retrograde propagating packets pertaining to the continuous spectrum approach the latitudes from the equatorial side and the prograde ones approach from the polar side is consistent with the profiles of their eigenfunctions derived using our numerical calculations. Further in-depth discussions of the Alfv\'en continuum would develop the theory of the ``wave-mean field interaction'' in the MHD system and the understanding of the dynamics in such thin layers.</description>

Abstract: Recent growing interest in using machine learning for turbulence modelling has led to many proposed data-driven turbulence models in the literature. However, most of these models have not been developed with overcoming non-unique mapping (NUM) in mind, which is a significant source of training and prediction error. Only NUM caused by one-dimensional channel flow data has been well studied in the literature, despite most data-driven models having been trained on two-dimensional flow data. The present work aims to be the first detailed investigation on NUM caused by two-dimensional flows. A method for quantifying NUM is proposed and demonstrated on data from a flow over periodic hills, and an impinging jet. The former is a wall-bounded separated flow, and the latter is a shear flow containing stagnation and recirculation. This work confirms that data from two-dimensional flows can cause NUM in data-driven turbulence models with the commonly used invariant inputs. This finding was verified with both cases, which contain different flow phenomena, hence showing that NUM is not limited to specific flow physics. Furthermore, the proposed method revealed that regions containing low strain and rotation or near pure shear cause the majority of NUM in both cases: approximately 76% and 89% in the flow over periodic hills and impinging jet, respectively. These results led to viscosity ratio being selected as a supplementary input variable (SIV), demonstrating that SIVs can reduce NUM caused by data from two-dimensional flows and subsequently improve the accuracy of tensor-basis machine learning models for turbulence modelling.</description>

      <title>Prediction of flow and elastic stresses in a viscoelastic turbulent channel flow using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural-network models have been employed to predict the instantaneous flow close to the wall in a viscoelastic turbulent channel flow. Numerical simulation data at the wall is utilized to predict the instantaneous velocity-fluctuations and polymeric-stress-fluctuations at three different wall-normal positions in the buffer region. The ability of non-intrusive predictions has not been previously investigated in non-Newtonian turbulence. Our analysis shows that velocity-fluctuations are predicted well from wall measurements in viscoelastic turbulence. The models exhibit enhanced accuracy in predicting quantities of interest during the hibernation intervals, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying physics during low-drag events. The neural-network models also demonstrate a reasonably good accuracy in predicting polymeric-shear stress and the trace of the polymer stress at a given wall-normal location. This method could be used in flow control or when only wall information is available from experiments (for example, in opaque fluids). More importantly, only velocity and pressure information can be measured experimentally, while polymeric elongation and orientation cannot be directly measured despite their importance for turbulent dynamics. We therefore study the possibility to reconstruct the polymeric-stress fields from velocity or pressure measurements in viscoelastic turbulent flows. The results are promising but also underline that a lack of small scales in the input velocity fields can alter the rate of energy transfer from flow to polymers, affecting the prediction of the polymer-stress fluctuations. The present approach not only aids in extracting polymeric-stress information but also gives information about the link between polymeric-stress and velocity fields in viscoelastic turbulence.</description>

      <title>2.5D turbulence in shear-thinning jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimensional transition in turbulent jets of a shear-thinning fluid is studied via direct numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that under vertical confinement, the flow exhibits a unique mixed-dimensional (or 2.5D) state, where large-scale two-dimensional and small-scale three-dimensional structures coexist. This transition from three-dimensional turbulence near the inlet to two-dimensional dynamics downstream is dictated by the level of confinement: weak confinement guarantees turbulence to remain three-dimensional, whereas strong confinement forces the transition to two-dimensions; the mixed-dimensional state is observed for moderate confinement and it emerges as soon as flow scales are larger than the vertical length. In this scenario, we observed that the mixed-dimensional state is an overall more energetic state and it shows a multi-cascade process, where the direct cascade of energy at small scales and the direct cascade of enstrophy at large scales coexist. The results provide insights into the complex dynamics of confined turbulent flows, relevant in both natural and industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Towards a self-consistent model of the convective core boundary in upper main sequence stars. Part I: 2.5D and 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04068</link>

Abstract: There is strong observational evidence that the convective cores of intermediate-mass and massive main sequence stars are substantially larger than those predicted by standard stellar-evolution models. However, it is unclear what physical processes cause this phenomenon or how to predict the extent and stratification of stellar convective boundary layers. Convective penetration is a thermal-timescale process that is likely to be particularly relevant during the slow evolution on the main sequence. We use our low-Mach-number Seven-League Hydro code to study this process in 2.5D and 3D geometries. Starting with a chemically homogeneous model of a $15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ zero-age main sequence star, we construct a series of simulations with the luminosity increased and opacity decreased by the same factor, ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$. After reaching thermal equilibrium, all of our models show a clear penetration layer; its thickness becomes statistically constant in time and it is shown to converge upon grid refinement. The penetration layer becomes nearly adiabatic with a steep transition to a radiative stratification in simulations at the lower end of our luminosity range. This structure corresponds to the adiabatic `step overshoot' model often employed in stellar-evolution calculations. The simulations with the highest and lowest luminosity differ by less than a factor of two in the penetration distance. The high computational cost of 3D simulations makes our current 3D data set rather sparse. Depending on how we extrapolate the 3D data to the actual luminosity of the initial stellar model, we obtain penetration distances ranging from $0.09$ to $0.44$ pressure scale heights, which is broadly compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <title>Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton-like minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves in dBECs characterised by topological defects (quantised vortices) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitation is demonstrated, supporting Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Local divergence-free velocity interpolation for the immersed boundary method using composite B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to improve volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. These delta functions employ tensor product kernels using B-splines, whose polynomial degrees vary in normal and tangential directions based on the corresponding velocity component. Our method addresses the long-standing volume conservation issues in the conventional IB method, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances volume conservation, rivaling the performance of the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method introduced by Bao et al. while maintaining the local nature of the classical IB method. This avoids the computational overhead associated with the DFIB method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves. Numerical experiments show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels can maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We analyze the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with volume conservation errors primarily dominated by the time-stepping scheme's truncation error. This work offers a computationally efficient alternative for improving volume conservation in IB methods, particularly beneficial for large-scale, three-dimensional simulations. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>
