      <title>Quadratic Speedup for Computing Contraction Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding an $\epsilon$-fixed point of a contraction map $f:[0,1]^k\mapsto[0,1]^k$ under both the $\ell_\infty$-norm and the $\ell_1$-norm. For both norms, we give an algorithm with running time $O(\log^{\lceil k/2\rceil}(1/\epsilon))$, for any constant $k$. These improve upon the previous best $O(\log^k(1/\epsilon))$-time algorithm for the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm by Shellman and Sikorski [SS03], and the previous best $O(\log^k (1/\epsilon ))$-time algorithm for the $\ell_{1}$-norm by Fearnley, Gordon, Mehta and Savani [FGMS20].</description>

      <title>Self-referential instances of the dominating set problem are irreducible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic decidability of the domination number in the Erdos-Renyi random graph model $G(n,p)$. We show that for a carefully chosen edge probability $p=p(n)$, the domination problem exhibits a strong irreducible property. Specifically, for any constant $0&lt;c&lt;1$, no algorithm that inspects only an induced subgraph of order at most $n^c$ can determine whether $G(n,p)$ contains a dominating set of size $k=\ln n$. We demonstrate that the existence of such a dominating set can be flipped by a local symmetry mapping that alters only a constant number of edges, thereby producing indistinguishable random graph instances which require exhaustive search. These results demonstrate that the extreme hardness of the dominating set problem in random graphs cannot be attributed to local structure, but instead arises from the self-referential nature and near-independence structure of the entire solution space.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Finding a Maximum Common Vertex Subgraph Without Isolated Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Maximum Common Vertex Subgraph problem: Given two input graphs $G_1,G_2$ and a non-negative integer $h$, is there a common subgraph $H$ on at least $h$ vertices such that there is no isolated vertex in $H$. In other words, each connected component of $H$ has at least $2$ vertices. This problem naturally arises in graph theory along with other variants of the well-studied Maximum Common Subgraph problem and also has applications in computational social choice. We show that this problem is NP-hard and provide an FPT algorithm when parameterized by $h$. Next, we conduct a study of the problem on common structural parameters like vertex cover number, maximum degree, treedepth, pathwidth and treewidth of one or both input graphs. We derive a complete dichotomy of parameterized results for our problem with respect to individual parameterizations as well as combinations of parameterizations from the above structural parameters. This provides us with a deep insight into the complexity theoretic and parameterized landscape of this problem.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Polynomial NP-Complete Algorithms Based on the NP Verifier Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While prior work established a verifier-based polynomial time framework for NP, explicit deterministic machines for concrete NP-complete problems have remained elusive.
  In this paper, we construct fully specified deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs) for SAT and Subset-Sum within a polynomial-time NP verifier simulation framework.
  We show that both machines operate in polynomial time and, for satisfiable instances, deterministically generate valid witnesses, thereby extending the framework to deterministic FNP computation without increasing the degree of polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we provide a complete implementation of the framework, including the dynamic computation graph, feasible-graph construction, verification walks, and Turing-machine simulation via edge extensions. The implementation behaves in accordance with the predicted polynomial-time bounds.
  To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the complete Python implementation and source code are made available in a public online repository.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Strategic Behavior in Primary Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of strategic behaviour in primary elections. Unlike direct voting systems, primaries introduce a multi-stage process in which voters first influence intra-party nominees before a general election determines the final winner. While previous work has evaluated primaries via welfare distortion, we instead examine their game-theoretic properties. We formalise a model of primaries under first-past-the-post with fixed tie-breaking and analyse voters' strategic behaviour. We show that determining whether a pure Nash equilibrium exists is $\Sigma_2^{\mathbf P}$-complete, computing a best response is NP-complete, and deciding the existence of subgame-perfect equilibria in sequential primaries is PSPACE-complete. These results reveal that primaries fundamentally increase the computational difficulty of strategic reasoning, situating them as a rich source of complexity-theoretic challenges within computational social choice.</description>

      <title>New Algorithms and Hardness Results for Robust Satisfiability of (Promise) CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of robust satisfiability of promise CSPs (PCSPs), initiated in (Brakensiek, Guruswami, Sandeep, STOC 2023 / Discrete Analysis 2025), and obtain the following results:
  For the PCSP 1-in-3-SAT vs NAE-SAT with negations, we prove that it is hard, under the Unique Games conjecture (UGC), to satisfy $1-\Omega(1/\log (1/\epsilon))$ constraints in a $(1-\epsilon)$-satisfiable instance. This shows that the exponential loss incurred by the BGS algorithm for the case of Alternating-Threshold polymorphisms is necessary, in contrast to the polynomial loss achievable for Majority polymorphisms.
  For any Boolean PCSP that admits Majority polymorphisms, we give an algorithm satisfying $1-O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ fraction of the weaker constraints when promised the existence of an assignment satisfying $1-\epsilon$ fraction of the stronger constraints. This significantly generalizes the Charikar--Makarychev--Makarychev algorithm for 2-SAT, and matches the optimal trade-off possible under the UGC. The algorithm also extends, with the loss of an extra $\log (1/\epsilon)$ factor, to PCSPs on larger domains with a certain structural condition, which is implied by, e.g., a family of Plurality polymorphisms.
  We prove that assuming the UGC, robust satisfiability is preserved under the addition of equality constraints. As a consequence, we can extend the rich algebraic techniques for decision/search PCSPs to robust PCSPs. The methods involve the development of a correlated and robust version of the general SDP rounding algorithm for CSPs due to (Brown-Cohen, Raghavendra, ICALP 2016), which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Necessary President in Elections with Parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an election where the set of candidates is partitioned into parties, and each party must choose exactly one candidate to nominate for the election held over all nominees. The Necessary President problem asks whether a candidate, if nominated, becomes the winner of the election for all possible nominations from other parties.
  We study the computational complexity of Necessary President for several voting rules. We show that while this problem is solvable in polynomial time for Borda, Maximin, and Copeland$^\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in [0,1]$, it is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete for general classes of positional scoring rules that include $\ell$-Approval and $\ell$-Veto, even when the maximum size of a party is two. For such positional scoring rules, we show that Necessary President is $\mathsf{W}[2]$-hard when parameterized by the number of parties, but fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of voter types. Additionally, we prove that Necessary President for Ranked Pairs is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete even for maximum party size two, and $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard with respect to the number of parties; remarkably, both of these results hold even for constant number of voters.</description>

      <title>Eulerian orientations and Hadamard codes: A novel connection via counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a novel connection between two classical mathematical notions, Eulerian orientations and Hadamard codes by studying the counting problem of Eulerian orientations (\#EO) with local constraint functions imposed on vertices. We present two special classes of constraint functions and a chain reaction algorithm, and show that the \#EO problem defined by each class alone is polynomial-time solvable by the algorithm. These tractable classes of functions are defined inductively, and quite remarkably the base level of these classes is characterized perfectly by the well-known Hadamard code. Thus, we establish a novel connection between counting Eulerian orientations and coding theory. We also prove a \#P-hardness result for the \#EO problem when constraint functions from the two tractable classes appear together.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Deterministic Polynomial Algorithm for NP Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13166v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The P versus NP problem asks whether every problem in NP, whose membership can be verified in polynomial time given a suitable certificate, can be decided by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. In this paper, we present a proof that P = NP by constructing a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for NP problems based on a graph-based computation framework.
  We introduce a structured computation model in which the transitions of a deterministic Turing machine are incrementally realized in the corresponding computation graph via edge extensions. Each extension step enforces a local feasibility condition that preserves consistency with valid NP verification paths across all possible certificates, ensuring that the maintained computation graph remains feasible at every stage. The total number of extension steps is polynomially bounded in the input size, and each step can be verified in polynomial time.
  As a result, the entire graph construction process runs in deterministic polynomial time and decides NP problems without enumerating certificates. This provides a direct and constructive resolution of the P versus NP question. Our result has significant implications for cryptography, combinatorial optimization, and artificial intelligence, where NP-complete problems play a central role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Finite model theory for pseudovarieties and universal algebra: preservation, definability and complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore new interactions between finite model theory and classical streams of universal algebra and semigroup theory. A key result is an example of finite algebras whose variety is not finitely axiomatisable in first order logic, but where the class of finite members are finitely axiomatisable amongst finite algebras. These algebras present a negative solution to a first order formulation of the Eilenberg-Sch\"utzenberger problem, and witness the simultaneous failure of the {\L}os-Tarski Theorem, the SP-Preservation Theorem and Birkhoff's HSP-Preservation Theorem at the finite level. The examples also show that a pseudovariety without any finite pseudoequational basis may be finitely axiomatisable in first order logic amongst finite algebras. Other results include the undecidability of deciding first order definability of the pseudovariety of a finite algebra, and a mapping from any fixed finite template constraint satisfaction problem to a first order equivalent variety membership problem.</description>

      <title>When does Metropolized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provably outperform Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of Metropolized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with the leapfrog integrator to sample from a distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose log-density is smooth, has Lipschitz Hessian in Frobenius norm and satisfies isoperimetry. We bound the gradient complexity to reach $\epsilon$ error in total variation distance from a warm start by $\tilde O(d^{1/4}\text{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ and demonstrate the benefit of choosing the number of leapfrog steps to be larger than 1. To surpass the previous analysis on Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) that has $\tilde{O}(d^{1/2}\text{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ dimension dependency [WSC22], we reveal a key feature in our proof that the joint distribution of the location and velocity variables of the discretization of the continuous HMC dynamics stays approximately invariant. This key feature, when shown via induction over the number of leapfrog steps, enables us to obtain estimates on moments of various quantities that appear in the acceptance rate control of Metropolized HMC. Notably, our analysis does not require log-concavity or independence of the marginals, and only relies on an isoperimetric inequality. To illustrate the relevance of the Lipschitz Hessian in Frobenius norm assumption, several examples that fall into our framework are discussed.</description>

      <title>Complexity Framework For Forbidden Subgraphs V: Beyond Simple Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the recently-introduced C123-framework, for (simple) graph problems restricted to inputs specified by the forbidding of some finite set of subgraphs, to more general graph problems possibly involving multiedges and self-loops. We study specifically the problems Multigraph Matching Cut, Multigraph d-Cut and Partially Reflexive Stable Cut in this connection. The last may be seen as a Surjective Homomorphism problem to a path P_3 in which both leaves are looped while the interior vertex is loopless. We consider also another family of Surjective Homomorphism problems to a cycle in which only one vertex is loopless.
  When one forbids a single (simple) subgraph, our first three problems exhibit the same complexity behaviour as C123-problems, but on finite sets of forbidden subgraphs, the classification appears more complex. While Multigraph Matching Cut and Multigraph d-Cut have the same classification as C123-problems, already Partially Reflexive Stable Cut fails to have. This is witnessed by forbidding as subgraphs both C_3 and H_1. Indeed, the difference of behaviour occurs only around pendant subdivisions of nets and pendant subdivisions of H_1. We examine this area in close detail.
  Our other Surjective Homomorphism problem, ostensibly somewhat similar to Partially Reflexive Stable Cut, behaves very differently when the input is restricted to some class that is H-subgraph-free. For example, it is solvable in polynomial time on any class of bounded degree. Also, its hardness will never be preserved under any form of edge subdivision.</description>

      <title>Refuting Perfect Matchings in Spectral Expanders is Hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the complexity of refuting the existence of a perfect matching in spectral expanders with an odd number of vertices, in the Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Sum of Squares (SoS) proof system. Austrin and Risse [SODA, 2021] showed that refuting perfect matchings in sparse $d$-regular \emph{random} graphs, in the above proof systems, with high probability requires proofs with degree $\Omega(n/\log n)$. We extend their result by showing the same lower bound holds for \emph{all} $d$-regular graphs with a mild spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Complexity of normalized stochastic first-order methods with momentum under heavy-tailed noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
