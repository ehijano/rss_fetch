      <title>Dissociation limits in Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the {\it Density Functional Theory} (DFT) framework, where a functional of the form $$F_\eps(\rho)=\eps T(\rho)+bC(\rho)-U(\rho)$$ has to be minimized in the class of non-negative measures $\rho$ which have a prescribed total mass $m$ (the total electronic charge). The parameter $\eps$ is small and the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ respectively represent the kinetic energy, the electronic repulsive correlation, the potential interaction term between electrons and nuclei. Several expressions for the above terms have been considered in the literature and our framework is general enough to include most of them.
  It is known that in general, when the positive charge of the nuclei is small, the so-called {\it ionization phenomenon} may occur, consisting in the fact that the minimizers of $F_\eps$ can have a total mass lower than $m$; this physically means that some of the electrons may escape to infinity when the attraction of the nuclei is not strong enough.
  Our main goal, continuing the research we started in \cite{bbcd18}, is to study the asymptotic behavior of the minimizers of $F_\eps$ as $\eps\to0$. We show that the $\Gamma$-limit functional is defined on sums of Dirac masses and has an explicit expression that depends on the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ that the model takes into account.
  Some explicit examples illustrate how the electrons are distributed around the nuclei according to the model used.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lie Derivatives and (Super-)Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slightly subtle notion of covariant Lie derivatives of \textit{bundle-valued} differential forms is crucial in many applications in physics, notably in the computation of conserved currents in gauge theories, and yet the literature on the topic has remained fragmentary. This note provides a complete and concise mathematical account of covariant Lie derivatives on a spacetime (super-)manifold $M,$ defined via choices of lifts of spacetime vector fields to principal $G$-bundles over it, or equivalently, choices of covariantization correction terms on spacetime. As an application in the context of (super-)gravity, two important examples of covariant Lie derivatives are presented in detail, which have not appeared in unison and direct comparison: $\bf{(i)}$ The natural covariant Lie derivative relating (super-)diffeomorphism invariance to local translational (super-)symmetry, and $\bf{(ii)}$ the Kosmann Lie derivative relevant to the description of isometries of (super-)gravity backgrounds. Finally, we use the latter to rigorously justify the usage of the traditional (non-covariant) Lie derivative on coframes and associated fields in dimensional reduction scenarios along abelian $G$-fibers, an issue which has thus far remained open for topologically non-trivial spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Random walks in a field of soft traps and criticality for the dissipative Abelian Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the dissipative abelian sandpile model, we analyze the trajectories of a one-dimensional random walk in a landscape of soft traps. These traps, placed at increasing distances from each other, correspond to dissipative sites in the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. We identify a critical growth rate of the sizes of intervals between successive traps where there is a transition between finiteness and non-finiteness of the expected survival time of the random walk. This corresponds to a transition between non-criticality and criticality of the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. Therefore, in this setting, we thus identify precisely how much dissipation can be added to the original abelian sandpile model in order to disrupt its criticality.</description>

      <title>Tables of practical invariants for distinguishing multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses to what extent the census of multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, proposed by the software package Anyonica and the anyonwiki website, can be regarded as a proper classification. The questions of correctness and completeness are briefly discussed, and the question of inequivalence of the provided categories is resolved under the assumption that all proposed data is correct. This is done by providing tables of small sets of invariants for these categories, for which (a) their invariance under automorphisms can be checked manually, and (b) the (in)equivalence of two skeletal fusion categories can be checked manually. These invariants can also be used to identify the category on the anyonwiki that corresponds to one for which the skeletal data is known.</description>

      <title>A coupled multiscale model of the human cornea accounting for the collagenous microstructure and the extracellular matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a micro-structurally based finite element model of the human cornea, where we explicitly describe the collagen-crosslink architecture in terms of a trusswork of non-linear struts, and the extracellular proteoglycan matrix in terms of continuum solid elements. We regard the cornea as a composite material with strongly non-linear properties within a finite kinematics framework. This innovative approach is based on two previously developed models, each of which has some drawbacks in describing stromal tissue degeneration. Separation of the continuum phase from the collagen microstructure allows a more realistic capture of the macroscopic phenomena observed in keratoconus pathologies, such as localized deformation.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group based implicit function approach to connecting orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting orbits are important invariant structures in the state space of nonlinear systems and various techniques are designed for their computation. However, a uniform analytic approximation of the whole orbit seems rare. Here, based on renormalization group, an implicit function scheme is designed to effectively represent connections of disparate types, where coefficients of the defining function satisfy a set of linear algebraic equations, which greatly simplifies their computation. Unknown system parameters are conveniently determined by minimizing an error function. Symmetry may be profitably utilized to reduce the computation load. Homoclinic or heteroclinic connections are found in five popular examples approximately or exactly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new scheme.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Operator Algebras and Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the EMS--IAMP Spring School ``Symmetries and Measurement in Quantum Field Theory''. This set of lecture notes covers four lectures: 1. Operator Algebras and Quantum Field Theory, 2. Tomita-Takesaki Modular Theory of von Neumann Algebras and the Bisognano-Wichmann/Borchers Theorem, 3. Local Covariant Quantum Field Theory, 4. Temperature and Entropy-Area Relation of Quantum Fields near Horizons of Dynamical Black Holes. The basic aim is to provide an introduction into some of the contemporary concepts and methods of quantum field theory in the operator-algebraic framework (lectures 1 to 3), and to illustrate (in lecture 4) how they may be applied in a theme of both perpetual and current interest - the ``thermodynamics'' (and also, the ``information content'') of quantum matter in the vicinity of black holes. While the topic of ``measurement'' in quantum field theory is not covered in these lectures (this topic has been presented in the lectures of Chris Fewster [arXiv:2504.17437]), the topic of``symmetry'' in quantum field theory does make an appearance: On one hand, in the form of the geometric action of Tomita-Takesai modular objects associated with certain operator algebras and states as stated in the theorems by Bisognano-Wichmann, and by Borchers, and on the other hand, in the form of local general covariance.
  The Spring School took place at the University of York, UK, April 7-11, 2025, organized by C.J. Fewster, D.W. Janssen and K. Rejzner, and funded by EPSRC Grant EP/Y000099/1 to the University of York, the European Mathematical Society, the International Association of Mathematical Physics, and COST Action (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) CA23115: Relativistic Quantum Information. The material presented in these notes is an expanded version of the material presented during the lectures by the author.</description>

      <title>Exact results for spin glass criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05842v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random fields of scales result when the class of musical scales is thought as a set of sites, and a site can be in one of two possible states (or spins): On or Off. We present a flexible simulated annealing model that produces generic configurations arising from equilibrium states (or Gibbs measures) associated to hamiltonian energy functions defined in terms of musical interactions with parameters that can be manipulated to customize properties of the scales. The starting point is to think of the set of scales as the combinatorial class of integer compositions and the final result is an effective thermodynamic search engine implemented in an open access application for the 12-TET tuning system: Scaletor.</description>

      <title>Time Invariant Sensor Tasking for Catalog Maintenance of LEO Space objects using Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catalog maintenance of space objects by limited number of ground-based sensors presents a formidable challenging task to the space community. This article presents a methodology for time-invariant tracking and surveillance of space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) by optimally directing ground sensors. Our methodology aims to maximize the expected number of space objects from a set of ground stations by utilizing concepts from stochastic geometry, particularly the Poisson point process. We have provided a systematic framework to understand visibility patterns and enhance the efficiency of tracking multiple objects simultaneously. Our approach contributes to more informed decision-making in space operations, ultimately supporting efforts to maintain safety and sustainability in LEO.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies brachistochrone trajectories. Four rules are formulated as sufficient conditions. Two rules apply for a general conservative force. Two rules apply for a central force. A central force allows wire replacement. The wire is replaced by appropriate magnetic field. This enables solving motion equations directly. We replace Euler Lagrange with direct integration.</description>

      <title>Connection stability of vector fields with astrophysical application to the Einstein-Vlasov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a method for considering the stability of smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold which may not be compact. We show that these kind of stability which is called "connection stability" is equivalent to the structural stability in the case of compact manifolds. We prove if X is a connection stable vector field, then any multiplication of it by a nonzero scalar is also a connection stable vector field. We present an example of a connection stable vector field on a noncompact manifold, and we also show that harmonic oscillator is not a connection stable vector field. We present a technique to prove a class of vector fields are not connection stable. As a concrete physical example, we will apply the analysis to the Einstein- Vlasov system in an astrophysical context in which we propose an approach that could, in principle and partially, help to understand the problem of galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore &amp; Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.</description>

Abstract: We show that semi-arithmetic surfaces of arithmetic dimension two which admit a modular embedding have exponential growth of mean multiplicities in their length spectrum. Prior to this work large mean multiplicities were rigorously confirmed only for the length spectra of arithmetic surfaces. We also discuss the relation of the degeneracies in the length spectrum and quantization of the Hamiltonian mechanical system on the surface.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to computing non-interacting kinetic energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-interacting kinetic energy functional, $T_s[\rho]$, plays a fundamental role in Density Functional Theory (DFT), but its explicit form remains unknown for arbitrary $N$-representable densities. While it can in principle be evaluated by solving a constrained optimization problem, the associated adjoint problem may not always be well-posed; the adjoint operator can also be singular. To the best of knowledge, none of the existing approaches in the literature exactly determine the non-interacting kinetic energy functional for a given electron density, $\rho$, even when $\rho$ corresponds to a ground state density of Kohn-Sham DFT analysis. In this work, we present a variational framework for computing an extension of $T_s[\rho]$ using an exact trigonometric reparametrization of the density that eliminates the need for an adjoint equation. We present a proof-of-concept numerical validation of the variational principle for the special case of 1D Kohn-Sham systems. Our method, however, is general and provides a systematic foundation for computing $T_s[\rho]$ in higher dimensions too, paving the way for improved kinetic energy functionals in DFT.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A discrete model of quantum ergodicity of linear maps generated by symplectic matrices $A \in \mathrm{Sp}(2d,\mathbb{Z})$ modulo an integer $N\ge 1$, has been studied for $d=1$ and almost all $N$ by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). Their result has been strengthened by J. Bourgain (2005) and subsequently by A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski, and J. F. Voloch (2023). For arbitrary $d$ this has been studied by P. Kurlberg, A. Ostafe, Z. Rudnick and I. E. Shparlinski (2024). The corresponding equidistribution results, for certain eigenfunctions, share the same feature: they apply to almost all moduli $N$ and are unable to provide an explicit construction of such ``good'' values of $N$. Here, using a bound of I. E. Shparlinski (1978) on exponential sums with linear recurrence sequences modulo a power of a fixed prime, we construct such an explicit sequence of $N$, with a power saving on the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Chiral higher-spin symmetry of the celestial twistor sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chiral higher-spin symmetry of the celestial twistor sphere via the chiral higher-spin algebras $\mathfrak{ca}$ associated with certain holomorphic higher-spin theories in twistor space. The chiral higher-spin algebras $\mathfrak{ca}$ are non-unitary $W_{1+\infty}[\mathfrak{g}]$ algebras in the sense that their higher-spin generators can have negative conformal dimensions. We study $\mathfrak{ca}$ up to first order in quantum correction. In particular, we show that the $\mathfrak{ca}$ associated with anomaly-free holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories are associative themselves, while the chiral algebras associated with anomalous holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories only become associative upon enlarging $\mathfrak{ca}$ by introducing suitable axionic currents. Furthermore, we compute four-dimensional form factors -- interpreted as genuine scattering amplitudes in the integrable sector -- via correlation functions of some chiral CFTs that can source higher-spin currents of $\mathfrak{ca}$ on the celestial twistor sphere. Notably, we observe that higher-spin form factors do not always vanish, suggesting the existence of some mysterious bulk theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and representation theory of finite-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras, including the corresponding root systems and Verma, irreducible, and Harish-Chandra modules. This extends the familiar theory for finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras to a much wider class of Lie algebras, and opens up for advances and applications in areas relying on ad-hoc approaches. Physically relevant examples are afforded by the Heisenberg and conformal Galilei algebras, including the Schr\"odinger algebras, whose $\mathbb{Z}$-graded structures are yet to be fully exploited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ denote the weighted adjacency matrix of a balanced, symmetric, bipartite graph. We define a class of bosonic networks given by Hamiltonians whose hopping terms are determined by $B$. We show that each quantum Hamiltonian is Yang-Baxter integrable, admitting a set of mutually commuting operators derived through a solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We discuss some applications and consequences of this result.</description>

Abstract: We describe and compute various families of commuting elements of the matrix shuffle algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|m}$, which is expected to be isomorphic to quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|m}$. Our formulas are given in terms of partial traces of products of $R$-matrices of the quantum affine algebra $U_t(\dot{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|m})$, and have a lattice path interpretation. Our calculations are based on the machinery of the quantum toroidal algebras and a new anti-homomorphism between matrix shuffle algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories are usually understood as limits of relativistic theories. In this note, we use Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a principal connection to construct Carrollian sigma models intrinsically. The resulting theories are neither ``electric'' nor ``magnetic'' in the usual sense. As a physically suggestive example, we derive a Carrollian wave equation governing the dynamics of a scalar field on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by selecting appropriate spectral matrices within the loop algebra of symplectic Lie algebra sp(6), we construct two distinct classes of integrable soliton hierarchies. Then, by employing the Tu scheme and trace identity, we derive the Hamiltonian structures of the aforementioned two classes of integrable systems. From these two classes of integrable soliton hierarchies, we select one particular hierarchy and employ the Kronecker product to construct an integrable coupling system.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection-based model order reduction with machine learning regression for closure error modeling in the latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant advancement in nonlinear projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) is presented through a highly effective methodology. This methodology employs Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for closure error modeling in the latent space, offering notable gains in efficiency and expanding the scope of PMOR. Moving beyond the limitations of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), previously used for this task, this approach provides crucial advantages in terms of interpretability and a reduced demand for extensive training data. The capabilities of GPR and RBFs are showcased in two demanding applications: a two-dimensional parametric inviscid Burgers problem, featuring propagating shocks across the entire computational domain, and a complex three-dimensional turbulent flow simulation around an Ahmed body. The results demonstrate that this innovative approach preserves accuracy and achieves substantial improvements in efficiency and interpretability when contrasted with traditional PMOR and ANN-based closure modeling.</description>

      <title>A hyperboloidal method for numerical simulations of multidimensional nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in n+1 dimensions. Unlike previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Dualities of Gaudin models with irregular singularities for general linear Lie (super)algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an equivalence between the actions of the Gaudin algebras with irregular singularities for $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ on the Fock space of $d(p+m)$ bosonic and $d(q+n)$ fermionic oscillators. This establishes a duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$ for Gaudin models. As an application, we show that the Gaudin algebra with irregular singularities for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ acts cyclically on each weight space of a certain class of infinite-dimensional modules over a direct sum of Takiff superalgebras over $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ and that the action is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum under a generic condition. We also study the classical versions of Gaudin algebras with irregular singularities and demonstrate a duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$ for classical Gaudin models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial holography suggests, among other things, that collinear singularities of graviton scattering amplitudes are described by the OPEs of some putative dual CFT. One of the great successes has been the insight that this duality is true at tree-level which led to the discovery of new infinite dimensional symmetry algebras of tree-level amplitudes in flat space closely related to w$_{1+\infty}$. This thesis studies these celestial chiral algebras in the light of twistor theory and derives tree-level deformations thereof induced by non-trivial background geometries that solve some form of the self-dual Einstein equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model based on Maxwells equations to describe the Talbot effect. After solving the model analytically, we prove that its solution is equivalent to the one amply found in the literature in the asymptotic limit. By considering the paraxial limit, we showcase how the rational Talbot effect arises, and derive an ideal paraxial distribution that would give such effects. We give a proof of $L^2$ convergence to these ideal distributions for any such grating. The universal nature of the Talbot effect makes our findings pertinent for a variety of physical systems and technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial flag varieties arise in the context of massless scattering kinematics. They can be associated to both spinor-helicity variables and momentum twistor variables in two separate yet natural ways. Here we report on evidence at five and six points that the cluster algebras associated to these partial flag varieties contain information relevant to non-dual conformal massless scattering amplitudes and related observables. At five points both spinor-helicity and momentum twistor cluster structures capture similar information about symbol alphabets. At six points we demonstrate that the momentum twistor structure captures a larger subset of the alphabet compared to the spinor-helicity one. We also observe that the associated cluster structures correctly predict the appearance of certain triples of symbol letters related to cluster mutation relations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Zernike polynomials from the tridiagonalization of the radial harmonic oscillator in displaced Fock states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the J-matrix method for the one dimensional radial harmonic oscillator (RHO) and construct its tridiagonal matrix representation within an orthonormal basis phi(z)n of L2 (R+);parametrized by a fixed z in the complex unit disc D and n = 0,1,2,.... Remarkably, for fixed n,and varying z in D, the system phi(z)n forms a family of Perelomov-type coherent states associated with the RHO. For each fixed n, the expansion of phi(z)n over the basis (fs) of eigenfunctions of the RHO yields coefficients cn,s(z; z) precisely given by two-dimensional complex Zernike polynomials. The key insight is that the algebraic tridiagonal structure of RHO contains the complete information about the bound state solutions of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator describing a charged particle in a magnetic field (of strength proportional to B &gt; 1/2) on the Poincar\'e disc D.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of TASEP and variants with inhomogeneous speeds and memory lengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [arXiv:1701.00018, arXiv:2107.07984] an explicit biorthogonalization method was developed that applies to a class of determinantal measures which describe the evolution of several variants of classical interacting particle systems in the KPZ universality class. The method leads to explicit Fredholm determinant formulas for the multipoint distributions of these systems which are suitable for asymptotic analysis. In this paper we extend the method to a broader class of determinantal measures which is applicable to systems where particles have different jump speeds and different memory lengths. As an application of our results we study three particular examples: some variants of TASEP with two blocks of particles having different speeds, a version of discrete time TASEP which mixes particles with sequential and parallel update, and a version of sequential TASEP with a block of long memory particles placed at the bulk of the system.</description>

Abstract: We justify Prandtl equations and higher order Prandtl expansion from the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equations. Our fluid data is of the form $\text{shear flow}$, plus $\sqrt\kappa$ order term in analytic spaces in $x_\parallel \in\mathbb T^2$ and Sobolev in $x_3\in\mathbb{R}_+$. This work is the first to rigorously justify the Prandtl equations from the hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann equations. The novelty lies in obtaining estimates for the linearized Boltzmann equation with a diffusive boundary condition around a Prandtl layer shear flow in analytic spaces. The key techniques involve delicate commutator estimates and the use of local conservation law.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>

Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Super-$\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ T-Duality and M-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super $L_\infty$-algebras unify extended super-symmetry with rational classifying spaces for higher flux densities: The super-invariant super-fluxes which control super $p$-branes and their supergravity target super-spaces are, together with their (non-linear) Bianchi identities, neatly encoded in (non-abelian) super-$L_\infty$ cocycles. These are the rational shadows of flux-quantization laws (in ordinary cohomology, K-theory, Cohomotopy, iterated K-theory, etc).
  We first review, in streamlined form while filling some previous gaps, double-dimensional reduction/oxidation and 10D superspace T-duality along higher-dimensional super-tori. We do so tangent super-space wise, by viewing it as an instance of adjunctions (dualities) between super-$L_\infty$-extensions and -cyclifications, applied to the avatar super-flux densities of 10D supergravity. In particular, this yields a derivation, at the rational level, of the traditional laws of "topological T-duality" from the super-$L_\infty$ structure of type II superspace. At this level, we also discuss a higher categorical analog of T-duality involving M-branes.
  Then, by considering super-space T-duality along all 1+9 spacetime dimensions while retaining the 11th dimension as in F-theory, we find the M-algebra appearing as the complete brane-charge extension of the fully T-doubled/correspondence super-spacetime. On this backdrop, we recognize the "decomposed" M-theory 3-form on the "hidden M-algebra" as an M-theoretic lift of the Poincar\'e super 2-form that controls superspace T-duality as the integral kernel of the super Fourier-Mukai transform. This provides the super-space structure of an M-theory lift of the doubled/correspondence space geometry, which controls T-duality.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, originally a three dimensional mathematical model of plasma with a uniform magnetic field, is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study the collision of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. PINNs are able to successfully solve the equations in the forward process, and the solutions are obtained using a mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation, taking into account conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. However, the situation becomes intractable in the collision process. The forward analysis result no longer adheres to the laws of conservation, and is better described as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) than a solution to the system. Conservative PINNs have thus been introduced for this purpose, and in this paper we succeed in obtaining solutions that satisfy conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation in which the coefficients exhibit significant changes, implying an emergence of temporary interactions. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the adherence to the laws of conservation has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>Conformal welding and the matter--Liouville--ghost factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the action of local conformal transformations on several measures related to the Gaussian free field and Schramm--Loewner evolutions. The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure ($\kappa\in(0,4]$); its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map, which we relate to the "$bc$-ghost system" from bosonic string theory. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformal welding of quantum surfaces.</description>

      <title>Macdonald deformation of Vogel's universality and link hyperpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vogel's universality implies a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. Actually this is true (if at all) only for a piece of representation theory captured by knot/Chern-Simons theory, where some irreducible representations are often undistinguishable and combined into new ``universally-irreducible" entities (uirreps). We consider from this point of view the recently discovered Macdonald deformation of quantum dimensions, for which a kind of universality holds for the ADE series. The claim is that universal are not Macdonald dimensions themselves, but their products with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, which themselves are functions of $q$ and $t$ in Macdonald theory. These products are precisely what arises in knot/refined Chern-Simons theory. Actually, we consider the simplest decomposition of adjoint square into six uirreps and obtain the universal formulas for hyperpolynomials of the Hopf link and, more generally, of the torus links $T[2,2n]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact complex manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>Classification of Toda-type tt*-structures and $\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$-fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify Toda-type tt*-structures in terms of the anti-symmetry condition. A Toda-type tt*-structure is a flat bundle whose flatness condition is the tt*-Toda equation (Guest-Its-Lin). We show that the Toda-type tt*-structure can be described as a fixed point of $e^{\sqrt{-1}\frac{2\pi}{n+1}}$-multiplication and this ``intrinsic'' description reduces the possibilities of the anti-symmetry condition to only two cases. We give an application to the relation between tt*-Toda equations and representation theory.</description>
