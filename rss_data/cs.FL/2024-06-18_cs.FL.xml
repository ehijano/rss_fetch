      <title>A Subclass of Mu-Calculus with the Freeze Quantifier Equivalent to Buchi Register Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Register automaton (RA) is an extension of finite automaton for dealing with data values in an infinite domain. In the previous work, we proposed disjunctive mu$^\downarrow$-calculus, which is a subclass of modal mu-calculus with the freeze quantifier, and showed that it has the same expressive power as RA. However, disjunctive mu$^\downarrow$-calculus is defined as a logic on finite words, whereas temporal specifications in model checking are usually given in terms of infinite words. In this paper, we re-define the syntax and semantics of disjunctive mu$^\downarrow$-calculus to be suitable for infinite words and prove that the obtained temporal logic has the same expressive power as Buchi RA.</description>

      <title>Reversible Transducers over Infinite Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic two-way transducers capture the class of regular functions. The efficiency of composing two-way transducers has a direct implication in algorithmic problems related to reactive synthesis, where transformation specifications are converted into equivalent transducers. These specifications are presented in a modular way, and composing the resultant machines simulates the full specification. An important result by Dartois et al. shows that composition of two-way transducers enjoy a polynomial composition when the underlying transducer is reversible, that is, if they are both deterministic and co-deterministic. This is a major improvement over general deterministic two-way transducers, for which composition causes a doubly exponential blow-up in the size of the inputs in general. Moreover, they show that reversible two-way transducers have the same expressiveness as deterministic two-way transducers. However, the question of expressiveness of reversible transducers over infinite words is still open. In this article, we introduce the class of reversible two-way transducers over infinite words and show that they enjoy the same expressive power as deterministic two-way transducers over infinite words. This is done through a non-trivial, effective construction inducing a single exponential blow-up in the set of states. Further, we also prove that composing two reversible two-way transducers over infinite words incurs only a polynomial complexity, thereby providing foundations for efficient procedure for composition of transducers over infinite words.</description>

      <title>A Representative Framework for Implementing Quantum Finite Automata on Real Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the implementation of quantum finite automata algorithms designed for the language $ MOD_p = \{ a^{i\cdot p } \mid i \geq 0 \}$ on gate-based quantum computers. First, we compile the known theoretical results from the literature to reduce the number of CNOT gates. Second, we demonstrate techniques for modifying the algorithms based on the basis gates of available quantum hardware in order to reduce circuit depth. Lastly, we explore how the number of CNOT gates may be reduced further if the topology of the qubits is known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a congruence that copes with null next-symbol probabilities that arise when the output of a language model is constrained by some means during text generation. We develop an algorithm for efficiently learning the quotient with respect to this congruence and evaluate it on case studies for analyzing statistical properties of LLM.</description>

      <title>Succinctness of Cosafety Fragments of LTL via Combinatorial Proof Systems (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on succinctness results for fragments of Linear Temporal Logic with Past (LTL) devoid of binary temporal operators like until, and provides methods to establish them. We prove that there is a family of cosafety languages (Ln)_{n&gt;=1} such that Ln can be expressed with a pure future formula of size O(n), but it requires formulae of size 2^{\Omega}(n) to be captured with past formulae. As a by-product, such a succinctness result shows the optimality of the pastification algorithm proposed in [Artale et al., KR, 2023]. We show that, in the considered case, succinctness cannot be proven by relying on the classical automata-based method introduced in [Markey, Bull. EATCS, 2003]. In place of this method, we devise and apply a combinatorial proof system whose deduction trees represent LTL formulae. The system can be seen as a proof-centric (one-player) view on the games used by Adler and Immerman to study the succinctness of CTL.</description>

      <title>Implicit automata in {\lambda}-calculi III: affine planar string-to-string functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a characterization of first-order string-to-string transduction via $\lambda$-terms typed in non-commutative affine logic that compute with Church encoding, extending the analogous known characterization of star-free languages. We show that every first-order transduction can be computed by a $\lambda$-term using a known Krohn-Rhodes-style decomposition lemma. The converse direction is given by compiling $\lambda$-terms into two-way reversible planar transducers. The soundness of this translation involves showing that the transition functions of those transducers live in a monoidal closed category of diagrams in which we can interpret purely affine $\lambda$-terms. One challenge is that the unit of the tensor of the category in question is not a terminal object. As a result, our interpretation does not identify $\beta$-equivalent terms, but it does turn $\beta$-reductions into inequalities in a poset-enrichment of the category of diagrams.</description>

      <title>On Rational Recursion for Holonomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that every component of a discrete-time rational dynamical system is a solution to an algebraic difference equation that is linear in its highest-shift term (a quasi-linear equation). We prove that the conjecture holds in the special case of holonomic sequences, which can straightforwardly be represented by rational dynamical systems. We propose two algorithms for converting holonomic recurrence equations into such quasi-linear equations. The two algorithms differ in their efficiency and the minimality of orders in their outputs.</description>

      <title>Reward Machines for Deep RL in Noisy and Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward Machines provide an automata-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing complex reward function structure, they enable counterfactual learning updates that have resulted in impressive sample efficiency gains. While Reward Machines have been employed in both tabular and deep RL settings, they have typically relied on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary that form the building blocks of the reward function. Such ground-truth interpretations can be elusive in many real-world settings, due in part to partial observability or noisy sensing. In this paper, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that leverage task structure under uncertain interpretation of domain-specific vocabulary. Theoretical analysis exposes pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem, while experimental results show that our algorithms successfully leverage task structure to improve performance under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary. Our results provide a general framework for exploiting Reward Machines in partially observable environments.</description>
