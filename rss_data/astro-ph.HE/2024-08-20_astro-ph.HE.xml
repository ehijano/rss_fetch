      <title>Investigating the mixing between two black hole populations in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a population model to analyze the mixing between hypothesised power-law and $\sim 35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump black hole populations in the latest gravitational wave catalog, GWTC-3, estimating their co-location and separation. We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\%$, between the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of mergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\%$. Our analysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally separate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in mixing and contributing to the $\mathcal{M} \sim 14 M_\odot$ peak in the chirp mass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black Holes (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that current theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump population may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the preference for BGBHs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Limb-Brightening in the Parsec-Scale Jet of NGC 315 through Global VLBI Observations and Its Implications for Jet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of the nearby giant radio galaxy NGC 315 using a global VLBI array consisting of 22 radio antennas located across five continents, including high-sensitivity stations, at 22 GHz. Utilizing the extensive $(u,v)$-coverage provided by the array, coupled with the application of a recently developed super-resolution imaging technique based on the regularized maximum likelihood method, we were able to transversely resolve the NGC 315 jet at parsec scales for the first time. Previously known for its central ridge-brightened morphology at similar scales in former VLBI studies, the jet now clearly exhibits a limb-brightened structure. This finding suggests an inherent limb-brightening that was not observable before due to limited angular resolution. Considering that the jet is viewed at an angle of $\sim50^\circ$, the observed limb-brightening is challenging to reconcile with the magnetohydrodynamic models and simulations, which predict that the Doppler-boosted jet edges should dominate over the non-boosted central layer. The conventional jet model that proposes a fast spine and a slow sheath with uniform transverse emissivity may pertain to our observations. However, in this model, the relativistic spine would need to travel at speeds of $\Gamma\gtrsim6.0-12.9$ along the de-projected jet distance of (2.3-10.8) $\times 10^3$ gravitational radii from the black hole. We propose an alternative scenario that suggests higher emissivity at the jet boundary layer, resulting from more efficient particle acceleration or mass loading onto the jet edges, and consider prospects for future observations with even higher angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Evidence for hybrid gamma-ray emission from the supernova remnant G150.3+4.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5 was first identified in radio, exhibiting a hard GeV spectrum and a $\sim 1.5^\circ$ radius. Radio observations revealed a bright arc with an index of $\sim -0.40$, which stands in contrast to the index of $\sim -0.69$ for the rest. This arc is coincident with the point-like \emph{Fermi} source 4FGL J0426.5+5434 and KM2A source 1LHAASO J0428+5531. The rest of the SNR has a hard GeV spectrum and a soft TeV spectrum, implying a spectral cut-off or break near 1 TeV. Since there is no X-ray counterpart and no pulse signal detected, the gamma-ray $(\gamma$-ray) emission mechanism from the SNR and the point-like source appear puzzling. In this work, we reanalyse the $\gamma$-ray emission using 14 yr data recorded by \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope and find that the spectrum of the northern half-sphere is compatible with a broken power law with a break at 146 $\pm$ 11 GeV and photon indices of $\Gamma_{\rm{Northlobe}}$ =$1.54\pm0.04_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.07_{\rm{syst}}$ ($2.28\pm0.08_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.12_{\rm{syst}}$) below (above) the break. In addition, the southern half-sphere can be described well with a single power law with $\Gamma_{\rm{Southlobe}}$ =$1.95\pm0.07_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.09_{\rm{syst}}$. Since the southern half-sphere is well correlated with CO emission, we propose that the $\gamma$-ray emission of the northern half-sphere could be dominated by relativistic electrons via inverse-Compton processes, while the southern half-sphere is dominated by cosmic rays via hadronic processes. 4FGL J0426.5+5434 may result from the illumination of a cloud by escaping cosmic rays or recent shock-cloud interaction. Observations from LHAASO-KM2A thus favour the possibility of a cosmic-ray PeVatron candidate, however, leptonic scenarios cannot be ruled out. Further multi-wavelength observations are warranted to confirm the hadronic nature of 1LHAASO J4028+5531.</description>

      <title>A Series of (Net) Spin-down Glitches in PSR J1522-5735: Insights from the Vortex Creep and Vortex Bending Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a detailed timing analysis of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data, the rotational behavior of the $\gamma$-ray pulsar PSR J1522$-$5735 was tracked from August 2008 (MJD 54692) to January 2024 (MJD 60320). During this 15.4-year period, two over-recovery glitches and four anti-glitches were identified, marking a rare occurrence in rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs). The magnitudes of these (net) spin-down glitches were determined to be $|\Delta\nu_{\rm g}/\nu| \sim 10^{-8}$, well above the estimated detectability limit. For the two over-recovery glitches, the respective recovery fractions $Q$ are $2.1(7)$ and $1.4(2)$. Further analysis showed no substantial variations in either the flux or pulse profile shape in any of these events, suggesting that small (net) spin-down glitches, unlike large events observed in magnetars and magnetar-like RPPs, may occur without leaving an impact on the magnetosphere. Within the framework of the vortex creep and vortex bending models, anti-glitches and over-recoveries indicate the recoupling of vortex lines that moved inward as a result of a crustquake; meanwhile, the apparent fluctuations in the spin-down rate after the glitches occur as a result of the coupling of the oscillations of bent vortex lines to the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>A choked jet in SN 2023ixf?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can take place along with the generation of a jet that fails to emerge from the stellar envelope of the progenitor star, i.e., a choked jet. Although the fraction of CCSNe that harbour such jets is unknown, it remains as an interesting possibility that can give rise to the production of high-energy neutrinos. In this work, we focus on the particular case of the recent type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, the closest of its class in the last decade. We describe the particle distributions of protons, pions, and muons in a putative jet applying a simple model to account for the relevant interactions, which are synchrotron cooling and interactions with the soft photon field in the ambient. After evaluating the produced fluence for different values of the viewing angle $i_{\rm j}$ with respect to the jet axis, and comparing with the upper bound by IceCube, we conclude that the generation of a choked jet in SN 2023ixf can not be ruled out. Specifically, for typical jet Lorentz factors of the jet $\Gamma=100$, the jet could have been produced with an half-opening angle $\theta_{\rm op}=0.2\,{\rm rad}$ but for a viewing angle $i_{\rm j}\gtrsim \theta_{\rm op}$, no significant Doppler boosting would take place along this direction. Therefore, the choked jet scenario in SN 2023ixf still remains compatible with observations provided our line of sight corresponds to an off-axis view of the jet.</description>

      <title>The Fast Radio Burst Population Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the energy distribution of the fast radio burst (FRB) population using a well-defined sample of 63 FRBs from the ASKAP radio telescope, 28 of which are localised to a host galaxy. We apply the luminosity-volume ($V/V_{\mathrm{max}}$) test to examine the distribution of these transient sources, accounting for cosmological and instrumental effects, and determine the energy distribution for the sampled population over the redshift range $0.01 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.02$. We find the distribution between $10^{23}$ and $10^{26}$J Hz$^{-1}$ to be consistent with both a pure power-law with differential slope $\gamma=-1.96 \pm 0.15$, and a Schechter function with $\gamma = -1.82 \pm 0.12$ and downturn energy $E_{\rm max} \sim 6.3 \cdot 10^{25}$J Hz$^{-1}$. We identify systematic effects which currently limit our ability to probe the luminosity function outside this range and give a prescription for their treatment. Finally, we find that with the current dataset, we are unable to distinguish between the evolutionary and spectral models considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Behavior of the Position and Ellipticity Angles at Polarization Mode Transitions in Pulsar Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization observations of radio pulsars show that abrupt transitions in the polarization vector's position angle can be accompanied by large excursions in the vector's ellipticity angle, suggesting the vector passes near the right or left circular pole of the Poincar\'e sphere. The behavior of the angles can be explained by a transition in dominance of the orthogonal polarization modes or a vector rotation caused by a change in the phase difference between the modes. Four polarization models are examined to quantify and understand the behavior of the angles at a mode transition: coherent polarization modes, partially coherent modes, incoherent modes with nonorthogonal polarization vectors, and incoherent orthogonal modes with an elliptically polarized emission component. In all four models, the trajectory of the mode transition on the Poincar\'e sphere follows the geodesic that connects the orientations of the mode polarization vectors. The results from the models can be similar, indicating that the interpretation of an observed transition within the context of a particular model is not necessarily unique. The polarization fraction of the emission and the average ellipticity angle depend upon the statistical character of the mode intensity fluctuations. The polarization fraction increases as the fluctuations increase. The excursion in ellipticity angle can be large when the mode intensities are quasi-stable and is suppressed when the intensity fluctuations are large.</description>

      <title>AXPs/SGRs: strange stars with crusts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters (SGRs) is believed to be powered by the dissipation of their strong magnetic fields, which coined the name `magnetar'. By combining timing and energy observational results, the magnetar model can be easily appreciated. From a timing perspective, the magnetic field strengths of AXPs and SGRs, calculated assuming dipole radiation, are extremely strong. From an energy perspective, the X-ray/soft gamma-ray luminosities of AXPs and SGRs are larger than their rotational energy loss rates (i.e., $ L_{\rm X}&gt;\dot E_{\rm rot}$). It is thus reasonable to assume that the high-energy radiation comes from magnetic energy decay, and the magnetar model has been extensively discussed (or accepted). However, we argue that: (1) calculating magnetic fields by assuming that rotational energy loss is dominated by dipole radiation (i.e., $\dot{E}_{\rm rot}\simeq\dot{E}_{\mu}$)) may be controversial, and we suggest that the energies carried by outflowing particles should also be considered; and (2) the fact that X-ray luminosity is greater than the rotational energy loss rate does not necessarily mean that the emission energy comes from the magnetic field decaying, which requires further observational testing. Furthermore, some observational facts conflict with the `magnetar' model, such as observations of anti-magnetars, high magnetic field pulsars, and radio and X-ray observations of AXPs/SGRs. Therefore, we propose a crusted strange star model as an alternative, which can explain many more observational facts of AXPs/SGRs.</description>

      <title>Periodicity search in the timing of the 25 millisecond pulsars from the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the presence of strictly periodic, as well as quasi-periodic signals, in the timing of the 25 millisecond pulsars from the EPTA DR2 dataset. This is especially interesting in the context of the recent hints of a gravitational wave background in these data, and the necessary further study of red-noise timing processes, which are known to behave quasi-periodically in some normal pulsars. We used Bayesian timing models developed through the run_enterprise pipeline: a strict periodicity was modelled as the influence of a planetary companion on the pulsar, while a quasi-periodicity was represented as a Fourier-domain Gaussian process. We found that neither model would clearly improve the timing models of the 25 millisecond pulsars in this dataset. This implies that noise and parameter estimates are unlikely to be biased by the presence of a (quasi-)periodicity in the timing data. Nevertheless, the results for PSRs J1744--1134 and J1012+5307 suggest that the standard noise models for these pulsars may not be sufficient. We also measure upper limits for the projected masses of planetary companions around each of the 25 pulsars. The data of PSR J1909--3744 yielded the best mass limits, such that we constrained the 95-percentile to 2*10^{-4} Earth-masses (roughly the mass of the dwarf planet Ceres) for orbital periods between 5 d--17 yr. These are the best pulsar planet mass limits to date.</description>

      <title>General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto exotic compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the extensions to general relativity and to the Standard Model of particle physics predict families of hypothetical compact objects, collectively known as exotic compact objects (ECOs). This category can be defined to encompass non-Kerr black holes both within and beyond general relativity, as well as horizonless compact objects such as boson stars. In order to model observational signatures and identify possible detections, it is crucial to understand the interaction between these objects and their surrounding medium, usually plasmas described by the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). To this end, we review the existent literature on GRMHD simulations of accretion onto these objects. These cover a variety of objects and accretion patterns. We conclude by listing possible directions to continue exploring this relatively young field.</description>

      <title>Observation of the $\gamma$-ray Emission from W43 with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the detection of the very-high-energy (VHE, $ 100{\rm\ GeV} &lt; E &lt; 100{\rm\ TeV} $) and ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E &gt; 100\rm\ TeV$) $\gamma$-ray emissions from the direction of the young star-forming region W43, observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observation (LHAASO). The extended $\gamma$-ray source was detected with a significance of ${\sim}16\,\sigma$ by KM2A and ${\sim}17\,\sigma$ by WCDA, respectively. The angular extension of this $\gamma$-ray source is about 0.5 degrees, corresponding to a physical size of about 50 pc. We discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission and possible cosmic ray acceleration in the W43 region using multi-wavelength data. Our findings suggest that W43 is likely another young star cluster capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to at least several hundred TeV.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of black hole energy reduction in the Blandford-Znajek process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is electromagnetic energy release from rotating black holes (BHs) along magnetic field lines threading them and widely believed to drive relativistic jets. This process is successfully demonstrated in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the coordinate system regular on the event horizon, by which one can estimate the outward Poynting flux, although the direct energy release through the horizon shown in the simulations does not provide an intuitive picture. We revisit the mechanism of BH energy reduction by utilizing the coordinate system singular on the horizon, in which the falling membrane of past accreted matter should exist above the horizon. We find that the Poynting flux is produced at the boundary between the falling membrane and the magnetically-dominated inflow, and the front of the inflow creates the negative electromagnetic energy, which reduces the rotational energy of spacetime. We also clarify that the poloidal electric current does not form a closed circuit within the magnetically-dominated flow. Previous interpretations of the BZ process and possibilities of the ideal MHD violation and BH charging are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the flux density spectral property of high linearly polarized signal from Pulsar J0332+5434</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization position angles (PPA) of time samples with high linear polarization often show two parallel tracks across the pulsar profile that follow the rotating vector model (RVM). This feature support coherent curvature radiation (CCR) as the underlying mechanism of radio emission from pulsars, where the parallel tracks of the PPA represent the orthogonal extraordinary X and ordinary O eigen modes of strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, the frequency evolution of these high linearly polarized signals remains unexplored. In this work we explore the flux density spectral nature of high linearly polarized signals by studying the emission from PSR J0332+5434 over a frequency range between 300 MHz and 750 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulsar average profile comprises of a central core and a pair of conal components. We find the high linearly polarized time samples to be broadband in nature and in many cases they resemble a narrow spiky feature in the conal regions. These spiky features are localised within a narrow pulse longitude, over the entire frequency range, and their spectral shapes sometimes resemble an inverted parabolic shape. In all such cases the PPA are exclusively along one of the orthogonal RVM tracks, likely corresponding to the X-mode. The inverted spectral shape can in principle be explained if the high linearly polarized emission in these time samples are formed due to incoherent addition of CCR from a large number of charged solitons (charge bunches) exciting the X-mode.</description>

      <title>From Low- to High-Frequency QPOs around the Non-Rotating Hairy Horndeski Black Hole: Microquasar GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the Horndeski black hole, associated with the scalar hairy parameter, offers insights into enigmatic cosmic phenomena such as dark matter. Additionally, the numerical study of the GRS 1915+105 source, which exhibits continuous variability in X-ray observations, along with its physical properties and mechanisms behind Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) frequencies, can contribute to observational studies. Motivated by this, we examine the variations in physical mechanisms around the non-rotating Horndeski black hole with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion related to the scalar hair parameter and the resulting QPO frequencies. With a decrease in the scalar hair parameter, the shock cone opening angle narrows due to the influence of the scalar field potential, and the stagnation point within the cone moves closer to the black hole horizon. With the changing scalar hair parameter, the simultaneous formation of the shock cone and bow shock is observed. Due to the intense increase in scalar potential, both the shock cone and bow shock disappeared, and a cavity surrounding the black hole forms in the area where the shock cone was. Additionally, QPO oscillations induced by the physical mechanisms observed in relation to the hair parameter are revealed through numerical simulations. A broad range of QPO frequencies is observed, from low to high frequencies, with resonance states like 3:2 occurring. Lastly, we define the potential range of the spin parameter for the GRS 1915+105 source based on the agreement between observational and numerical results. It has also been found that for most of the QPOs obtained from numerical calculations to be consistent with observations, h/M should be greater than -0.5.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the nanohertz gravitational wave background using a $t$-process power spectral density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars' timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a $t$-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15-year data set, and we demonstrate that the $t$-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power-law are present. With longer timed datasets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Running of the Spectral Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>A Classifier-Based Approach to Multi-Class Anomaly Detection Applied to Astronomical Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating anomaly detection is an open problem in many scientific fields, particularly in time-domain astronomy, where modern telescopes generate millions of alerts per night. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical time-series rely either on hand-crafted features or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the latent space of a neural network classifier for anomaly detection. We then propose a new method called Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for an object based on its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest when distinct clusters exist in the latent space. Using a simulated dataset emulating the Zwicky Transient Facility (54 anomalies and 12,040 common), our anomaly detection pipeline discovered $46\pm3$ anomalies ($\sim 85\%$ recall) after following up the top 2,000 ($\sim 15\%$) ranked objects. Furthermore, our classifier-based approach outperforms or approaches the performance of other state-of-the-art anomaly detection pipelines. Our novel method demonstrates that existing and new classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection. The code used in this work, including a Python package, is publicly available, https://github.com/Rithwik-G/AstroMCAD.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Application of mesh refinement to relativistic magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During relativistic magnetic reconnection, antiparallel magnetic fields undergo a rapid change in topology, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of non-thermal particle acceleration. This work explores the application of mesh refinement to 2D reconnection simulations to efficiently model the ineherent disparity in length-scales. We have systematically investigated the effects of mesh refinement and determined necessary modifications to the algorithm required to mitigate non-physical artifacts at the coarse-fine interface. We have used the ultrahigh-order Pseudo-Spectral Analytical Time-Domain (PSATD) Maxwell solver to analyze how its use can mitigate the numerical dispersion that occurs with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) (or ``Yee'') method. Absorbing layers are introduced at the coarse-fine interface to eliminate spurious effects that occur with mesh refinement. We also study how damping the electromagnetic fields and current density in the absorbing layer can help prevent the non-physical accumulation of charge and current density at the coarse-fine interface. Using a mesh refinement ratio of 8 for two-dimensional magnetic reconnection simulations, we obtained good agreement with the high resolution baseline simulation, using only 36% of the macroparticles and 71% of the node-hours needed for the baseline. The methods presented here are especially applicable to 3D systems where higher memory savings are expected than in 2D, enabling comprehensive, computationally efficient 3D reconnection studies in the future.</description>

      <title>A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in $\alpha$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of $\alpha$ Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170-day Long Secondary Period (LSP) in Betelgeuse's lightcurve, a periodicity $\approx5$ times longer than the star's 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity variation observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. The lightcurve-RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, 180 degrees out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for $\alpha$ Ori B of $1.17\pm0.7\,M_\odot$ and an orbital separation of $1850\pm70\,R_\odot$, or $2.43^{+0.21}_{-0.32}$ times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion's existence observationally.</description>

      <title>Exploring The Dynamical Nature and Radio Halo Emission of Abell 384: A Combined Radio, X-ray and Optical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiwavelength studies of galaxy clusters are crucial for understanding the complex interconnection of the thermal and non-thermal constituents of these massive structures and uncovering the physical processes involved in their formation and evolution. Here, we report a multiwavelength assessment of the galaxy cluster A384, which was previously reported to host a radio halo with a 660 kpc size at MeerKAT 1.28 GHz. The halo is slightly offset from the cluster centre. Our uGMRT observation reveals that the halo extends up to 690 kpc at 407 MHz with a nonuniform spectral index $\alpha^{1284}_{407}$ distribution varying from flat (-0.5) to steep (-1.3) values. In addition, we use legacy GMRT 608 MHz, \textit{XMM-Newton} X-ray, and the Dark Energy Survey optical observations to obtain an extensive understanding of the dynamical nature of the galaxy cluster. The X-ray surface brightness concentration parameter (c$_{SB}$ = 0.16) and centroid shift (w = 0.057) reveal an ongoing dynamical disturbance in the cluster. This is also supported by the elongated 2-D optical galaxy density distribution map of the cluster. We obtain an asymmetry parameter of 0.35 $\pm$ 0.04 from optical analysis, further supporting the dynamical disturbance in the cluster. The radio and X-ray surface brightness follows a sub-linear correlation. Our observation suggests that the cluster is currently in a merging state where particle re-acceleration in the turbulent ICM resulted in the radio halo emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise Phinney's 'practical theorem' to account for modified graviton dispersion relations motivated by certain cosmological scenarios. Focusing on specific examples, we show how such modifications can induce characteristic localised distortions, bumps, in the frequency profile of the stochastic gravitational wave background emitted from distant binary sources. We concentrate on gravitational waves at nano-Hertz frequencies probed by pulsar timing arrays, and we forecast the capabilities of future experiments to accurately probe parameters controlling modified dispersion relations. Our predictions are based on properties of gravitational waves emitted in the first inspiral phase of the binary process, and do not rely on assumptions of non-linear effects occurring during the binary merging phase</description>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations have just started probing the properties of black hole binary merger populations. The observation of binaries with very massive black holes and significantly asymmetric masses motivates the study of dense star clusters as astrophysical environments which can produce such events dynamically. In this paper we present Rapster (for "Rapid cluster evolution"), a new code designed to rapidly model binary black hole population synthesis and the evolution of massive star clusters based on simple, yet realistic prescriptions. We also perform a thorough comparison with the Cluster Monte Carlo code and find generally good agreement. The code can be used to generate large populations of dynamically formed binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Color-flavor locked strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter and the observations of compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and the tidal deformability of the color-flavor locked strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter. Assuming the stars in the GW170817 event have a mirror-dark-matter core or a mirror-dark-matter halo, the observations of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 and the compact objects in the GW190814 and GW170817 events could be explained simultaneously with a pairing gap much smaller than 200 MeV. In contrast, a pairing gap larger than about 200 MeV must be employed without the consideration of a mirror-dark-matter core (halo). More importantly, we find that for the case of the quartic coefficient $a_{4}&lt; 0.589$, if the mass fraction of the mirror mdark matter ($f_{D}$) of the compact stars in GW170817 is in a certain range (eg., $22.8\% &lt; f_{D} &lt; 77.2\%$ for $a_{4}= 0.55$), the minimum allowed value of the pairing gap could be less than 46.5 MeV (i.e., one half of the value of the strange quark mass which is taken as 93 MeV in this paper), which leads to the result that all astrophysical observations mentioned above could be satisfied without violating the conformal bound or the recently proposed positive trace anomally bound.</description>

Abstract: A large fraction of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources in the fourth Fermi-LAT 14 yr catalog (4FGL) still remain unidentified (unIDed). We continued to improve our machine-learning pipeline and used it to classify 1206 X-ray sources with signal-to-noise ratios &gt;3 located within the extent of 73 unIDed 4FGL sources with Chandra X-ray Observatory observations included in the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0. Recent improvements to our pipeline include astrometric corrections, probabilistic cross-matching to lower-frequency counterparts, and a more realistic oversampling method. X-ray sources are classified into eight broad predetermined astrophysical classes defined in the updated training data set, which we also release. We present details of the machine-learning classification, describe the pipeline improvements, and perform an additional spectral and variability analysis for brighter sources. The classifications give 103 plausible X-ray counterparts to 42 GeV sources. We identify 2 GeV sources as isolated neutron star candidates, 16 as active galactic nucleus candidates, seven as sources associated with star-forming regions, and eight as ambiguous cases. For the remaining 40 unIDed 4FGL sources, we could not identify any plausible counterpart in X-rays, or they are too close to the Galactic Center. Finally, we outline the observational strategies and further improvements in the pipeline that can lead to more accurate classifications.</description>

      <title>Two-component off-axis jet model for radio flares of tidal disruption events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, radio emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been observed from months to years after the optical discovery. Some of the TDEs including ASASSN-14ae, ASASSN-15oi, AT 2018hyz, and AT 2019dsg are accompanied by the late-time rebrightening phase characterized by a rapid increase in the radio flux. We show that it can be explained by the off-axis two-component jet model, in which the late-time rebrightening arises from the off-axis view of a decelerating narrower jet with an initial Lorentz factor of ~10 and a jet opening angle of ~0.1 rad, while the early-time radio emission is attributed to the off-axis view of a wider jet component. We also argue that the rate density of jetted TDEs inferred from these events is consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Radiation from the Interaction between Magnetar Bursts and Companion Star in a Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars are young, highly magnetized neutron stars that are associated with magnetar short bursts (MSBs), magnetar giant flares (MGFs), and at least some fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this work, we consider a magnetar and a main sequence star in a binary system and analyze the properties of the electromagnetic signals generated by the interaction between the magnetar bursts and the companion star. During the preburst period, persistent radiation could be generated by the interaction between the $e^+e^-$-pair wind from the magnetar and the companion or its stellar wind. We find that for a newborn magnetar, the persistent preburst radiation from the strong magnetar wind can be dominant, and it is mainly at the optical and ultraviolet (UV) bands. For relatively old magnetars, the re-emission from a burst interacting with the companion is larger than the persistent preburst radiation and the luminosity of the companion itself. The transient re-emission produced by the heating process has a duration of $0.1 - 10^5 {\rm~s}$ at the optical, UV, and X-ray bands. Additionally, we find that if these phenomena occur in nearby galaxies within a few hundred kiloparsecs, they could be detected by current or future optical telescopes.</description>

      <title>Determination of dark matter distribution in Ursa Major III and constraints on dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered satellite dwarf galaxy Ursa Major III provides a promising opportunity to explore the signatures resulting from dark matter (DM) annihilation, due to its proximity and large J-factor. Owing to the absence of an excess of $\gamma$-ray signatures originating from Ursa Major III, observations of $\gamma$-rays, such as those from Fermi-LAT, can be utilized to set constraints on the DM annihilation cross section. In this study, we determine the DM density profile, and consider the relationship between DM density and velocity dispersion at different locations within Ursa Major III through Jeans analysis. We calculate the J-factor of Ursa Major III for s-wave annihilation, along with the effective J-factors for p-wave and Sommerfeld enhanced annihilation scenarios. Utilizing these derived J-factors, we set stringent constraints on DM annihilation cross sections in three scenarios. Given the substantial impact of member star identification on the J-factor of Ursa Major III, we further calculate J-factors with the condition of excluding the largest velocity outlier. Our analysis reveals a notable reduction in the median value and an increase in the deviation of J-factors, thereby leading to considerably weaker constraints.</description>

      <title>Could a slow stable hybrid star explain the central compact object in HESS~J1731-347?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an alternative explanation for the low-mass ultra-compact star in the supernova remnant HESS~J1731-347 using a model-agnostic approach to construct hybrid equations of state. The hadronic part of the hybrid equation of state is constructed using a generalized piecewise polytropic scheme, while the quark phase is described by the generic constant speed of sound model. We assume an abrupt first-order hadron-quark phase transition with a slow conversion speed between phases. Our equations of state align with modern Chiral Effective Field Theory calculations near nuclear saturation density and are consistent with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations at high densities. Using this theoretical framework, we derive a wide range of hybrid equations of state capable of explaining the light compact object in HESS~J1731-347 in a model-independent manner, without fine-tuning. These equations of state are also consistent with modern astronomical constraints from high-mass pulsar timing, NICER observations, and multimessenger astronomy involving gravitational waves. Our results support the hypothesis that the compact object in HESS~J1731-347 could plausibly be a slow stable hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Polarization Patterns of Non-Circular Hotspots around Kerr Black Holes: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength polarized light signals from supermassive black holes have sparked many studies on polarized images of accretion disks and hotspots. However, the polarization patterns within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) region remain to be explored. In this study, we focus on two specific types of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and homoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with non-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we specifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing along the azimuthal direction and establish a simplified synchrotron emission model. Based on these, we analyze the polarized patterns of hotspots accumulated over time and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the polarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Constraining the geometry of the dipping atoll 4U 1624-49 with X-ray spectroscopy and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the spectro-polarimetric results obtained from simultaneous X-ray observations with IXPE, NuSTAR and NICER of the dipping neutron star X-ray binary 4U 1624-49. This source is the most polarized Atoll source so far observed with IXPE, with a polarization degree of 2.7% $\pm$ 0.9% in the 2-8 keV band during the non-dip phase and marginal evidence of an increasing trend with energy. The higher polarization degree compared to other Atolls can be explained by the high inclination of the system ($i \approx 60${\deg}). The spectra are well described by the combination of a soft thermal emission, a Comptonized component, plus reflection of soft photons off the accretion disk. During the dips, the hydrogen column density of the highly-ionized absorber increases while the ionization state decreases. The Comptonized radiation seems to be the dominant contribution to the polarized signal, with additional reflected photons which significantly contribute even if their fraction in the total flux is not high.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Emissions from Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Implications for Nuclear Equation of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observation of binary neutron-star mergers can provide valuable information on the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Here, we investigate to which extent electromagnetic observations of the associated kilonovae allow us to place constraints on the EoS. For this, we use state-of-the-art three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics simulations and detailed nucleosynthesis modeling to connect properties of observed light curves to properties of the accretion disk, and hence, the EoS. Using our general approach, we use multi-messenger observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo to study the impact of various sources of uncertainty on inferences of the EoS. We constrain the radius of a $\rm{1.4 M_\odot}$ neutron star to lie within $\rm{10.19\leq R_{1.4}\leq 13.0}$~km and the maximum mass to be $\rm{M_{TOV}\leq 3.06 M_\odot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions (on and above $d=2$) is investigated in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics theories that depend exclusively on the invariant $\mathcal{F}\left(=-(1/4)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\right)$. In this vein, we consider propagating waves under the influence of external uniform electric and magnetic fields. Features related to the blackbody radiation in the presence of a background constant electric field such as the generalization of the spectral energy density distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are obtained. Interestingly enough, anisotropic contributions to the frequency spectrum appear in connection to the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field. In addition, the long wavelength regime and Wien's displacement law in this situation are studied. The corresponding thermodynamics quantities at thermal equilibrium, such as energy, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity densities are contemplated as well.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey I. X-ray surface brightness profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides the material needed for galaxy formation and influences galaxy evolution. The hot ($T&gt;10^6K$) CGM is poorly detected around galaxies with stellar masses ($M_*$) lower than $3\times10^{11}M_\odot$ due to the low surface brightness. We used the X-ray data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys (eRASS:4). Based on the SDSS spectroscopic survey and halo-based group finder algorithm, we selected central galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts of $z_{\rm spec}&lt;0.2$ and stellar masses of $10.0&lt;\log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;11.5$ (85,222 galaxies) -- or halo masses of $11.5&lt;\log(M_{\rm 200m}/M_\odot)&lt;14.0$ (125,512 galaxies). By stacking the X-ray emission around galaxies, masking the detected X-ray point sources and carefully modeling the X-ray emission from the unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB), we obtain the X-ray emission from the hot CGM. We detected the X-ray emission around MW-mass and more massive central galaxies extending up to the virial radius ($R_{\rm vir}$). We used a $\beta$ model to describe the X-ray surface brightness profile and found $\beta =0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.06}\,(0.37^{+0.04}_{-0.02})$ for MW-mass (M31-mass) galaxies.We estimated the baryon budget of the hot CGM and obtained a value that is lower than the prediction of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, indicating significant gas depletion in these halos. We extrapolated the hot CGM profile measured within $R_{\rm vir}$ to larger radii and found that within $\approx 3 R_{\rm vir}$, the baryon budget is close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology prediction. Our results set a firm footing for the presence of the hot CGM around such galaxies. These measurements constitute a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and possible implementations of feedback processes therein.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey II. Scaling relations between X-ray luminosity and galaxies' mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the properties of galaxies relate to the properties of the hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) around them can constrain galaxy evolution models. We measured the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM based on the surface brightness profiles of central galaxy samples measured from Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA all-sky survey data. We related the X-ray luminosity to the galaxies' stellar and halo mass, and we compared the observed relations to the self-similar model and intrinsic (i.e., not forward-modeled) output of the IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The average hot CGM X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X,CGM}$) correlates with the galaxy's stellar mass ($M_*$). It increases from $(1.6 \pm 2.1)\times10^{39} \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ to $(3.4 \pm 0.3)\times10^{41} \rm erg\,s^{-1}$, when $\log(M_*)$ increases from 10.0 to 11.5. A power law describes the correlation as $\log(L_{\rm X,CGM})= (2.4\pm 0.1)\times \log(M_*)+(14.6\pm1.5)$. The hot CGM X-ray luminosity as a function of halo mass is measured within $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3-13.7$, extending our knowledge of the scaling relation by more than two orders of magnitude. $L_{\rm X,CGM}$ increases with $M_{\rm 500c}$ from $(3.0 \pm 1.6)\times10^{39}\ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=11.3$ to $(1.3 \pm 0.1)\times10^{42}\ \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\log(M_{\rm 500c})=13.7$. The relation follows a power law of $\log(L_{\rm X,CGM})= (1.32\pm 0.05)\times \log(M_{\rm 500c})+(24.1\pm0.7)$. Our observations highlight the necessity of non-gravitational processes at the galaxy group scale while suggesting these processes are sub-dominant at the galaxy scale. We show that the outputs of current cosmological galaxy simulations generally align with the observational results uncovered here but with possibly important deviations in selected mass ranges.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 3$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Optimized Search for a Binary Black Hole Merger Population in LIGO-Virgo O3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing the number of detections in matched filter searches for compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave (GW) signals requires a model of the source population distribution. In previous searches using the PyCBC framework, sensitivity to the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers was improved by restricting the range of filter template mass ratios and use of a simple one-dimensional population model. However, this approach does not make use of our full knowledge of the population and cannot be extended to a full parameter space search. Here, we introduce a new ranking method, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with adaptive bandwidth, to accurately model the probability distributions of binary source parameters over a template bank, both for signals and for noise events. We demonstrate this ranking method by conducting a search over LIGO-Virgo O3 data for BBH with unrestricted mass ratio, using a signal model derived from previous significant detected events. We achieve over 10% increase in sensitive volume for a simple power-law simulated signal population, compared to the previous BBH search. Correspondingly, with the new ranking, 8 additional candidate events above an inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) threshold 0.5 yr are identified.</description>

      <title>Supernova limits on 'QCD axion-like particles'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of massive Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to quarks and gluons, dubbed 'QCD ALPs', with an emphasis on the associated low-energy observables. ALPs coupled to gluons and quarks not only induce nuclear interactions at scales below the QCD-scale, relevant for ALP production in supernovae (SNe), but naturally also couple to photons similarly to the QCD-axion. We discuss the link between the high-energy formulation of ALP theories and their effective couplings with nucleons and photons. The induced photon coupling allows ALPs with masses $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV to efficiently decay into photons, and astrophysical observables severely constrain the ALP parameter space. We show that a combination of arguments related to SN events rule out ALP-nucleon couplings down to $g_{aN}\gtrsim 10^{-11}- 10^{-10}$ for $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV - a region of the parameter space that was hitherto unconstrained.</description>
