      <title>Universality and threshold laws for collision lifetimes at ultralow temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While collision lifetimes are a fundamental property of few-body scattering events, their behavior at ultralow temperatures is not completely understood. We derive a general expression for the Smith lifetime Q-matrix using multichannel quantum defect theory, which allows us to obtain the average time delay in the incident $s$-wave collision channel in the limit of zero collision energy $E$, $Q_{11}=A/\sqrt{E} + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants. We show that the time delay is dominated by elastic scattering, and contains an additional multichannel contribution independent of the two-body scattering length. We also obtain the expressions for the collision lifetime using the universal model of Idziaszek and Julienne [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 113202 (2010)]. The lifetime acquires an imaginary part in the presence of inelastic loss due to the lack of unitarity of the S-matrix, and shortens with increasing the short-range loss parameter $y$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures containing a fluorinated benzene and a hydrocarbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorobenzene, or 1,4-difluorobenzene or hexafluorobenzene + alkane mixtures and hexafluorobenzene + benzene, or + toluene, or + 1,4-dimethylbenzene systems have been studied using thermodynamic properties from the literature and through the application of the DISQUAC and UNIFAC (Dortmund) models and the concentration-concentration structure factor ($S_{\text{CC}}(0)$). Interaction parameters for the contacts F/alkane and F/aromatic have been determined for DISQUAC, and they have been taken from the literature for UNIFAC. Both models predict double azeotropy for the C$_6$F$_6$ + C$_6$H$_6$ system, although in different temperature ranges. Excess molar enthalpies ($H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) of the fluorobenzene, or 1,4-difluorobenzene + n-alkane systems are positive and are accurately described by the models using interaction parameters independent of the n-alkane, discarding Patterson's effect in such mixtures. DISQUAC calculations confirm that conclusion for C$_6$F$_6$ + n-alkane mixtures. DISQUAC provides better results than UNIFAC on excess molar isobaric heat capacities ($C_{p\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) of solutions involving n-alkanes, or on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ of C$_6$F$_6$ + aromatic hydrocarbon systems. For mixtures with a given n-alkane, the relative variation of excess molar internal energies at constant volume ($U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and with the fluorohydrocarbons is different, due to structural effects. C$_6$F$_6$ + aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures are characterized by interactions between unlike molecules, as seen from their negative $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values. The $S_{\text{CC}}(0)$ formalism reveals that homocoordination is more important in C$_6$F$_6$ + n-alkane mixtures than in the corresponding systems with C$_6$H$_5$F, and that heterocoordination is dominant in the solutions of C$_6$F$_6$ with an aromatic hydrocarbon.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive theory for relativistic polaritonic chemistry: a way toward a four component ab initio treatment of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new ab-initio approach to study molecules containing heavy atoms strongly interacting with quantum fields in optical devices. The relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory has been rewritten with a formalism close to relativistic quantum chemistry. This general framework represents the ideal starting point to extend the main quantum chemistry methods to relativistic QED. The Polaritonic Dirac Hartree Fock (Pol-DHF) approach is the first method we propose based on this theory. Pol-DHF allows for the simulation of field induced effects on the ground and excited state properties of heavy transition metals molecular complexes. The method is able to include not only the effects of the photons but can be easily extended also to include explicit interactions with positrons. Application of Pol-DHF to three metal hydrides revealed the importance of including radiative QED corrections to the treatment in strong coupling conditions. Due to an accurate description of spin-orbit coupling, the method is able to reproduce polaritonic effects happening at the crossing between singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Solid-liquid equilibria and excess enthalpies in binary mixtures of acetophenone with some aliphatic amides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-liquid equilibria for the binary systems of acetophenone and {N-methylformamide, or N,Ndimethylformamide, or N,N-dimethylacetamide, or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone} were determined by the cloudpoint and DSC techniques. For the same systems, excess enthalpies were measured at 293.15 K and 308.15 K by the titration calorimetry. Both types of data were correlated by the Redlich-Kister equation. The description of the solid-liquid equilibria incorporated measured excess enthalpies. The results of the prediction performed by the modified UNIFAC modelwere compared with the experimental data. The observed trends and differences between systems were discussed.</description>

      <title>Rotationally Resolved Spectroscopy of a Single Polyatomic Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the rotationally resolved spectrum of a single polyatomic molecular ion in the gas phase. Building upon the recently developed inelastic recoil spectroscopy (IRS) technique, we have achieved a spectral resolution sufficient to observe resolved rotational-vibrational transitions of a trapped cyclopropenyl cation, c-C3H3+. The high precision of IRS shown in this work presents an attractive platform for astrochemistry, single molecule chiral detection, and tests of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Narrowing band gap chemically and physically: Conductive dense hydrocarbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band gap energy of an organic molecule can be reduced by intermolecular interaction enhancement, and thus, certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are insulators with wide band gaps, are expected to undergo insulator-metal transitions by simple compression. Such a pressure-induced electronic transition can be exploited to transform non-metallic organic materials into states featuring intriguing electronic characteristics such as high-temperature superconductivity. Numerous attempts have been made to metalize various small PAHs, but so far only pressure-induced amorphization well below the megabar region was observed. The wide band gap energy of the small PAHs and low chemical stability under simple compression are the bottlenecks. We have investigated the band gap energy evolution and the crystal structural compression of the large PAH molecules, where the band gap energy is significantly reduced by increasing the number of {\pi}-electrons and improved chemical stability with fully benzenoid molecular structure. Herein, we present a pressure-induced transition in dicoronylene, C48H20, an insulator at ambient conditions that transforms into a semi-metallic state above 23.0 GPa with a three-order-of-magnitude reduction in resistivity. In-situ UV-visible absorption, transport property measurement, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations were performed to provide tentative explanations to the alterations in its electronic structure at high pressure. The discovery of an electronic transition at pressures well below the megabar is a promising step towards realization of a single component purely hydrocarbon molecular metal in the near future.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal vs Local Pseudopotentials Affect Kinetic Energy Kernels in Orbital-Free DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic energy (KE) kernel, which is defined as the second order functional derivative of the KE functional with respect to density, is the key ingredient to the construction of KE models for orbital free density functional theory (OFDFT) applications. For solids, the KE kernel is usually approximated using the uniform electron gas (UEG) model or the UEG-with-gap model. These kernels do not have information about the effects from the core electrons since there are no orbitals for the projection on nonlocal pseudopotentials. To illuminate this aspect, we provide a methodology for computing the KE kernel from Kohn-Sham DFT and apply it to the valence electrons in bulk aluminum (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in bulk silicon (Si) in a semiconducting crystal diamond state. We find that bulk-derived local pseudopotentials provide accurate results for the KE kernel in the interstitial region. The effect of using nonlocal pseudopotentials manifests at short wavelengths, defined by the diameter of an ion surrounded by its core electrons. Specifically, we find that the utilization of nonlocal pseudopotentials leads to significant deviations in the KE kernel from the von Weizsacker result in this region, which is, as a rule, explicitly enforced in most widely used KE functional approximations for OFDFT simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of interstellar phosphine towards asymptotic giant branch star IRC+10216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorus (P) is an important element for the chemical evolution of galaxies and many kinds of biochemical reactions. Phosphorus is one of the crucial chemical compounds in the formation of life on our planet. In an interstellar medium, phosphine (PH$_{3}$) is a crucial biomolecule that plays a major role in understanding the chemistry of phosphorus-bearing molecules, particularly phosphorus nitride (PN) and phosphorus monoxide (PO), in the gas phase or interstellar grains. We present the first confirmed detection of phosphine (PH$_{3}$) in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) carbon-rich star IRC+10216 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6. We detect the $J$ = 1$_{0}$$-$0$_{0}$ rotational transition line of PH$_{3}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\geq$3.5$\sigma$. This is the first confirmed detection of phosphine (PH$_{3}$) in the ISM. Based on LTE spectral modelling, the column density of PH$_{3}$ is (3.15$\pm$0.20)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ at an excitation temperature of 52$\pm$5 K. The fractional abundance of PH$_{3}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (8.29$\pm$1.37)$\times$10$^{-8}$. We also discuss the possible formation pathways of PH$_{3}$ and we claim that PH$_{3}$ may be created via the hydrogenation of PH$_{2}$ on the grain surface of IRC+10216.</description>

      <title>The ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first counter-example showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This property had been conjectured to hold for decades and it plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counter-example involves an external potential generated by six nuclei of small fractional charges, placed far away from each other. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is proved to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. In addition, we show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. Although the conjecture remains open for real nuclei (of integer charges), our work sets some doubt on the validity of the energy convexity for general atoms and molecules.</description>
