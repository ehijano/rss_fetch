      <title>Higher dimensional floorplans and Baxter d-permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $2-$dimensional mosaic floorplan is a partition of a rectangle by other rectangles with no empty rooms. These partitions (considered up to some deformations) are known to be in bijection with Baxter permutations. A $d$-floorplan is the generalisation of mosaic floorplans in higher dimensions, and a $d$-permutation is a $(d-1)$-tuple of permutations. Recently, in N. Bonichon and P.-J. Morel, {\it J. Integer Sequences} 25 (2022), Baxter $d$-permutations generalising the usual Baxter permutations were introduced.
  In this paper, we consider mosaic floorplans in arbitrary dimensions, and we construct a generating tree for $d$-floorplans, which generalises the known generating tree structure for $2$-floorplans. The corresponding labels and rewriting rules appear to be significantly more involved in higher dimensions.
  Moreover we give a bijection between the $2^{d-1}$-floorplans and $d$-permutations characterized by forbidden vincular patterns. Surprisingly, this set of $d$-permutations is strictly contained within the set of Baxter $d$-permutations.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Disconnected Character Degree Graphs Satisfying P\'alfy's Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite solvable group with disconnected character degree graph $\Delta(G)$. Under these conditions, it follows from a result of P\'alfy that $\Delta(G)$ consists of two connected components. Another result of P\'alfy's gives an inequality relating the sizes of these two connected components. In this paper, we calculate the number of possible component size pairs that satisfy P\'alfy's inequality. Additionally, for a fixed positive integer $n$, the number of distinct graph orders for which exactly $n$ component size pairs satisfy P\'alfy's inequality is shown.</description>

      <title>Stiffness matrices of graph blow-ups and the $d$-dimensional algebraic connectivity of complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-dimensional algebraic connectivity $a_d(G)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a quantitative measure of its $d$-dimensional rigidity, defined in terms of the eigenvalues of stiffness matrices associated with different embeddings of the graph into $\mathbb{R}^d$. For a function $a:V\to \mathbb{N}$, we denote by $G^{(a)}$ the $a$-blow-up of $G$, that is, the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing every vertex $v\in V$ with an independent set of size $a(v)$. We determine a relation between the stiffness matrix eigenvalues of $G^{(a)}$ and the eigenvalues of certain weighted stiffness matrices associated with the original graph $G$. This resolves, as a special case, a conjecture of Lew, Nevo, Peled and Raz on the stiffness eigenvalues of balanced blow-ups of the complete graph.
  As an application, we obtain a lower bound on the $d$-dimensional algebraic connectivity of complete bipartite graphs. More precisely, we prove the following: Let $K_{n,m}$ be the complete bipartite graph with sides of size $n$ and $m$ respectively. Then, for every $d\ge 1$ there exists $c_d&gt;0$ such that, for all $n,m\ge d+1$ with $n+m\ge \binom{d+2}{2}$, $a_d(K_{n,m})\ge c_d\cdot \min\{n,m\}$. This bound is tight up to the multiplicative constant. In the special case $d=2$, $n=m=3$, we obtain the improved bound $a_2(K_{3,3})\ge 2(1-\lambda)$, where $\lambda\approx 0.6903845$ is the unique positive real root of the polynomial $176 x^4-200 x^3+47 x^2+18 x-9$, which we conjecture to be tight.</description>

      <title>BCFW tilings and cluster adjacency for the amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2005, Britto, Cachazo, Feng and Witten gave a recurrence (now known as the BCFW recurrence) for computing scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills theory. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka subsequently introduced the amplituhedron to give a geometric interpretation of the BCFW recurrence. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka conjectured that each way of iterating the BCFW recurrence gives a "triangulation" or "tiling" of the m=4 amplituhedron. In this article we prove the BCFW tiling conjecture of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka. We also prove the cluster adjacency conjecture for BCFW tiles of the amplituhedron, which says that facets of tiles are cut out by collections of compatible cluster variables for the Grassmannian Gr(4,n). Moreover we show that each BCFW tile is the subset of the Grassmannian where certain cluster variables have particular signs.</description>

      <title>The Borsuk Problem for Subsets of the Vertices of the 10-Dimensional Boolean Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the papers Ziegler(2001) and Goldstein(2012) it was previously shown that any subset of the Boolean cube $ S \subset \{0,1\}^n $ for $ n \leq 9 $ can be partitioned into $n+1$ parts of smaller diameter, i.e., the Borsuk conjecture holds for such subsets. In this paper, it is shown that this is also true for $ n=10 $; however, the complexity of the computational verification increases significantly. In order to perform the computations in a reasonable time, several heuristics were developed to reduce the search tree. The SAT solver $\textbf{kissat}$ was used to cut off the search branches.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Lower Bound on the Chromatic Number using $p$-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ A(G) $ be the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $ G $, and let $\chi(G)$ denote its chromatic number. For $ p &gt; 0 $, we define the positive and negative $ p $-energies of $ G $ as $$ \mathcal{E}_p^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0} \lambda_i^p(A(G)), \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &lt; 0} |\lambda_i(A(G))|^p, $$ where $ \lambda_1(A(G)) \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n(A(G)) $ are the eigenvalues of $ A(G) $. We first prove that $$ \chi(G) \geq 1 + \max \left\{ \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}, \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)} \right\} $$ holds for all $ 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 $. This result has already been established for $ p = 0 $ and $ p = 2 $, and it holds trivially for $ p = 1 $. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for certain graphs, non-integer values of $p$ yield sharper lower bounds on $\chi(G)$ than existing spectral bounds. Finally, we conjecture that the same inequality continues to hold for all $ 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 $.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the number of stars in graphs with forbidden properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s proved an upper bound on the number of edges in an $n$-vertex non-Hamiltonian graph with given minimum degree and showed sharpness via two members of a particular graph family. F\"{u}redi, Kostochka and Luo showed that these two graphs play the same role when ``number of edges'' is replaced by ``number of t-stars,'' and that two members of a more general graph family maximize the number of edges among non-$k$-edge-Hamiltonian graphs. In this paper we generalize their former result from Hamiltonicity to related properties (traceability, Hamiltonian-connectedness, $k$-edge Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonicity) and their latter result from edges to $t$-stars. We identify a family of extremal graphs for each property that is forbidden. This problem without the minimum degree condition was also open; here we conjecture a complete description of the extremal family for each property, and prove the characterization in some cases. Finally, using a different family of extremal graphs, we find the maximum number of $t$-stars in non-$k$-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of generalized Ewens random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the characteristic polynomial for random permutation matrices sampled from the generalized Ewens distribution. Under this distribution, the measure of a given permutation depends only on its cycle structure, according to certain weights assigned to each cycle length. The proof is based on uniform control of the characteristic polynomial using results from the singularity analysis of generating functions, together with the convergence of traces to explicit random variables expressed via a Poisson family. The limit function is the exponential of a Poisson series which has already appeared in the case of uniform permutation matrices. It is the Poisson analog of the Gaussian Holomorphic Chaos, related to the limit of characteristic polynomials for other matrix models such as Circular Ensembles, i.i.d. matrices, and Gaussian elliptic matrices.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorems for Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for paths states that in a simple $P_k$-free graph, $m \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$, where $P_k$ denotes a path with length $k$ (that is, with $k$ edges). In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $p(v)$ be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[m \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{p(v)}{2}\] The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for cycles states that in a simple graph $G$ with circumference (that is, the length of the longest cycle) at most $k$, we have $m \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. We strengthen this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[m \leq \left( \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{c(v)}{2} \right) - \frac{c(u)}{2}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. \newline Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in these bounds.</description>

      <title>Defective coloring of blowups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $d\ge 0$, its $d$-defective chromatic number $\chi^d(G)$ is the smallest size of a partition of the vertices into parts inducing subgraphs with maximum degree at most $d$. Guo, Kang and Zwaneveld recently studied the relationship between the $d$-defective chromatic number of the $(d+1)$-fold (clique) blowup $G\boxtimes K_{d+1}$ of a graph $G$ and its ordinary chromatic number, and conjectured that $\chi(G)=\chi^d(G\boxtimes K_{d+1})$ for every graph $G$ and $d\ge 0$. In this note we disprove this conjecture by constructing graphs $G$ of arbitrarily large chromatic number such that $\chi(G)\ge \frac{30}{29}\chi^d(G\boxtimes K_{d+1})$ for infinitely many $d$. On the positive side, we show that the conjecture holds with a constant factor correction, namely $\chi^d(G\boxtimes K_{d+1})\le \chi(G)\le 2\chi^d(G\boxtimes K_{d+1})$ for every graph $G$ and $d\ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Spanning clique subdivisions in pseudorandom graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the appearance of a spanning subdivision of a clique in graphs satisfying certain pseudorandom conditions. Specifically, we show the following three results. Firstly, that there are constants $C&gt;0$ and $c\in (0,1]$ such that, whenever $d/\lambda\ge C$, every $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph contains a spanning subdivision of $K_t$ for all $2\le t \le \min\{cd,c\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}\}$. Secondly, that there are constants $C&gt;0$ and $c\in (0,1]$ such that, whenever $d/\lambda\ge C\log^3n$, every $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph contains a spanning nearly-balanced subdivision of $K_t$ for all $2\le t \le \min\{cd,c\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log^3n}}\}$. Finally, we show that for every $\mu&gt;0$, there are constants $c,\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ and $n_0\in \mathbb N$ such that, whenever $n\ge n_0$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\mu n$ and no bipartite holes of size $\varepsilon n$ contains a spanning nearly-balanced subdivision of $K_t$ for all $2\le t \le c\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>$SL_k$-Tilings and Paths in $\mathbb{Z}^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $SL_k$-tiling is a bi-infinite array of integers having all adjacent $k\times k$ minors equal to one and all adjacent $(k+1)\times (k+1)$ minors equal to zero. Introduced and studied by Bergeron and Reutenauer, $SL_k$-tilings generalize the notion of Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns in the case $k=2$. In a recent paper, Short showed a bijection between bi-infinite paths of reduced rationals in the Farey graph and $SL_2$-tilings. We extend this result to higher $k$ by constructing a bijection between $SL_k$-tilings and certain pairs of bi-infinite strips of vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ called paths. The key ingredient in the proof is the connection to Pl\"ucker friezes and Grassmannian cluster algebras. As an application, we obtain results about periodicity, duality, and positivity for tilings.</description>

      <title>A two-player voting game in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we regard as the locations of voters on a $d$-dimensional political `spectrum', two candidates (Alice and Bob) select one point in $\mathbb{R}^d$ each, in an attempt to get as many votes as possible. Alice goes first and Bob goes second, and then each voter simply votes for the candidate closer to them in terms of Euclidean distance. If a voter's distance from the two candidates is the same, they vote for nobody. We give a geometric characterization of the sets $S$ for which each candidate wins, assuming that Alice wins if they get an equal number of votes. We also show that, if not all the voters lie on a single line, then, whenever Alice has a winning strategy, there is a unique winning point for her. We also provide an algorithm which decides whether Alice has a winning point, and determines the location of that point, both in finite (in fact polynomial) time.</description>

Abstract: A {\em hole} is an induced cycle of length at least 4, a $k$-hole is a hole of length $k$, and an {\em odd hole} is a hole of odd length. Let $\ell\ge 2$ be an integer. Let ${\cal A}_{\ell}$ be the family of graphs of girth at least $2\ell$ and having no odd holes of length at least $2\ell+3$, let ${\cal B}_{\ell}$ be the triangle-free graphs which have no 5-holes and no odd holes of length at least $2\ell+3$, and let ${\cal G}_{\ell}$ be the family of graphs of girth $2\ell+1$ and have no odd hole of length at least $2\ell+5$. Chudnovsky {\em et al.} \cite{CSS2016} proved that every graph in ${\cal A}_{2}$ is 58000-colorable, and every graph in ${\cal B}_{\ell}$ is $(\ell+1)4^{\ell-1}$-colorable. Lan and liu \cite{LL2023} showed that for $\ell\geq3$, every graph in ${\cal G}_{\ell}$ is 4-colorable. It is not known whether there exists a small constant $c$ such that graphs of ${\cal G}_2$ are $c$-colorable. In this paper, we show that every graph in ${\cal G}_2$ is 1456-colorable, and every graph in ${\cal A}_{3}$ is 4-colorable. We also show that every 7-hole free graph in ${\cal B}_{\ell}$ is $(12\ell+8)$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Long-eared digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a subdigraph of a digraph $D$. An ear of $H$ in $D$ is a path or a cycle in $D$ whose ends lie in $H$ but whose internal vertices do not. An \emph{ear decomposition} of a strong digraph $D$ is a nested sequence $(D_0,D_1,\ldots , D_k)$ of strong subdigraphs of $D$ such that: 1) $D_0$ is a cycle, 2) $D_{i+1} = D_i\cup P_i$, where $P_i$ is an ear of $D_i$ in $D$, for every $i\in \{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$, and 3) $D_k=D$.
  In this work, the $\mathcal{LE}_i$ is defined as the family of strong digraphs, with an ear decomposition such that every ear has a length of at least $i\geq 1$. It is proved that Seymour's second Neighborhood Conjecture and the Laborde, Payan, and Soung conjecture, are true in the family $\mathcal{LE}_2$, and the Small quasi-kernel conjecture is true for digraphs in $\mathcal{LE}_3$. Also, some sufficient conditions for a strong nonseparable digraph in $\mathcal{LE}_2$ with a kernel to imply that the previous (following) subdigraph in the ear decomposition has a kernel too, are presented. It is proved that digraphs in $\mathcal{LE}_2$ have a chromatic number at most 3, and a dichromatic number 2 or 3. Finally, the oriented chromatic number of asymmetrical digraphs in $\mathcal{LE}_3$ is bounded by 6, and it is shown that the oriented chromatic number of asymmetrical digraphs in $\mathcal{LE}_2$ is not bounded.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite lower bounds for covering codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_q(n,r)$ denote the minimum size of a $q$-ary covering code of word length $n$ and covering radius $r$. In other words, $K_q(n,r)$ is the minimum size of a set of $q$-ary codewords of length $n$ such that the Hamming balls of radius $r$ around the codewords cover the Hamming space $\{0,\ldots,q-1\}^n$. The special case $K_3(n,1)$ is often referred to as the football pool problem, as it is equivalent to finding a set of forecasts on $n$ football matches that is guaranteed to contain a forecast with at most one wrong outcome.
  In this paper, we build and expand upon the work of Gijswijt (2005), who introduced a semidefinite programming lower bound on $K_q(n,r)$ via matrix cuts. We develop techniques that strengthen this bound, by introducing new semidefinite constraints inspired by Lasserre's hierarchy for 0-1 programs and symmetry reduction methods, and a more powerful objective function. The techniques lead to sharper lower bounds, setting new records across a broad range of values of $q$, $n$, and $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a robot that walks along a knot once on a knot diagram and switches every undercrossing it meets, stopping when it comes back to the starting position. We show that such a robot always unknots the knot. In fact, we prove that the robot produces an ascending diagram, and we provide a purely combinatorial proof that every ascending or descending knot diagram with C crossings can be transformed into the zero-crossing unknot diagram using at most (7C+1)C Reidemeister moves. Moreover, we show that an ascending or descending knot diagram can always be transformed into a zero-crossing unknot diagram using Reidemeister moves that do not increase the number of crossings.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of characters of parabolic Verma modules, and of restricted Kostant partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Huh-Matherne-Meszaros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur polynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete) log-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type-$A$ root directions). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of finite-dimensional simple representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. In the same paper, these authors also showed that shifted characters of Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian.
  In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that subsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we explain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition function of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and normalizing. In contrast, we show that a larger universal family of highest weight modules, the higher order Verma modules, do not have discretely log-concave characters. Finally, we extend all of these results to parabolic (i.e. "first order") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie algebras $\oplus_{t=1}^T \mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>

      <title>The Factor Width Rank of a Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matrix is said to have factor width at most $k$ if it can be written as a sum of positive semidefinite matrices that are non-zero only in a single $k \times k$ principal submatrix. We explore the ``factor-width-$k$ rank'' of a matrix, which is the minimum number of rank-$1$ matrices that can be used in such a factor-width-at-most-$k$ decomposition. We show that the factor width rank of a banded or arrowhead matrix equals its usual rank, but for other matrices they can differ. We also establish several bounds on the factor width rank of a matrix, including a tight connection between factor-width-$k$ rank and the $k$-clique covering number of a graph, and we discuss how the factor width and factor width rank change when taking Hadamard products and Hadamard powers.</description>

      <title>Deriving differential approximation results for $k\,$CSPs from combinatorial designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inapproximability results for $\mathsf{Max\,k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ have been traditionally established using balanced $t$-wise independent distributions, which are closely related to orthogonal arrays, a famous family of combinatorial designs. In this work, we investigate the role of these combinatorial structures in the context of the differential approximability of $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$, providing new structural insights and approximation bounds. We first establish a direct connection between the average differential ratio on $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ instances and orthogonal arrays. This allows us to derive the new differential approximability bounds of $1/q^k$ for $(k +1)$-partite instances, $\Omega(1/n^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor})$ for Boolean instances, $\Omega(1/n)$ when $k =2$, and $\Omega(1/n^{k -\lceil\log_{\Theta(q)}k\rceil})$ when $k, q\geq 3$. We then introduce families of array pairs, called {\em alphabet reduction pairs of arrays}, that are still related to balanced $k$-wise independence. Using these pairs of arrays, we establish a reduction from $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ to $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!k}$ (where $q &gt;k$), with an expansion factor of $1/(q -k/2)^k$ on the differential approximation guarantee. Combining this with a 1998 result by Yuri Nesterov, we conclude that $\mathsf{2\,CSP\!-\!q}$ is approximable within a differential factor of $0.429/(q -1)^2$. Finally, using similar Boolean array pairs, {\em called cover pairs of arrays}, we prove that every Hamming ball of radius $k$ provides a $\Omega(1/n^k)$-approximation of the instance diameter. Thus, our work highlights the relevance of combinatorial designs for establishing structural differential approximation guarantees for CSPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K\H onig's theorem says that the vertex cover number of every bipartite graph is at most its matching number (in fact they are equal since, trivially, the matching number is at most the vertex cover number). An equivalent formulation of K\H onig's theorem is that in every $2$-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, the number of monochromatic components needed to cover the vertex set of $G$ is at most the independence number of $G$.
  We prove the following strengthening of K\H onig's theorem: In every $2$-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, the number of monochromatic subgraphs of bounded diameter needed to cover the vertex set of $G$ is at most the independence number of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the class of Cayley graphs known as generalized Paley graphs (GP-graphs for short) given by $\Gamma(k,q) = Cay(\mathbb{F}_q, \{x^k : x\in \mathbb{F}_q^* \})$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, both in the directed and undirected case. Hence $q=p^m$ with $p$ prime, $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and one can assume that $k\mid q-1$. We first give the connected components of an arbitrary GP-graph. We show that these components are smaller GP-graphs all isomorphic to each other (generalizing a Lim and Praeger's result from 2009 to the directed case). We then characterize those GP-graphs which are disjoint unions of odd cycles. Finally, we show that $\Gamma(k,q)$ is non-bipartite except for the graphs $\Gamma(2^m-1,2^m)$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$, which are isomorphic to $K_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup K_2$, the disjoint union of $2^{m-1}$ copies of $K_2$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the conjugation of the reddening sequence according to the formula of $c$-vectors with respect to changing the initial seed. As applications, we extend the Rotation Lemma, the Target before Source Theorem, and the mutation invariant property of the existence of reddening sequences to totally sign-skew-symmetric cluster algebras. Furthermore, this also leads to the construction of conjugation difference which characterizes the number of red mutations a maximal green sequence should admit in any matrix pattern with the initial seed changed via mutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We extend our results to all classical types. Type $D$ is resolved in the appendix (joint with David Speyer).</description>

      <title>Substitution dynamical systems are loosely Kronecker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). We show that the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. Thus, any two words in $\mathcal{W}_n$ have a common subsequence of length $n-o(n)$, which implies that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Kronecker (also known as zero-entropy loosely Bernoulli). The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt {n/6} - 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\leq n$ be positive integers and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ be the set of integers modulo $n$. A conjecture of Baranyai from 1974 asks for a decomposition of $k$-element subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ into particular families of sets called "wreaths". We approach this conjecture from a new algebraic angle by introducing the key object of this paper, the wreath matrix $M$. As our first result, we establish that Baranyai's conjecture is equivalent to the existence of a particular vector in the kernel of $M$. We then employ results from representation theory to study $M$ and its spectrum in detail. In particular, we find all eigenvalues of $M$ and their multiplicities, and identify several families of vectors which lie in the kernel of $M$.</description>

Abstract: Dokow and Holzman determined which predicates over $\{0, 1\}$ satisfy an analog of Arrow's theorem: all unanimous aggregators are dictatorial. Szegedy and Xu, extending earlier work of Dokow and Holzman, extended this to predicates over arbitrary finite alphabets.
  Mossel extended Arrow's theorem in an orthogonal direction, determining all aggregators without the assumption of unanimity. We bring together both threads of research by extending the results of Dokow-Holzman and Szegedy-Xu to the setting of Mossel. As an application, we determine, for each symmetric predicate over $\{0,1\}$, all of its aggregators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove log-concavity for the function counting partitions without sequences. We use an exact formula for a mixed-mock modular form of weight zero, explicit estimates on modified Kloosterman sums and analytic techniques. Finally, we establish the higher Tur\'an inequalities in an asymptotic form of the aforementioned partition function using a well established criterion of Griffin, Ono, Rolen, and Zagier on the zeros of Jensen polynomials.</description>

      <title>Exact formula for 1-lower run overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are going to show an exact formula for lower $1$-run overpartitions. The generating function is of mixed mock-modular type with an overall weight $0.$ We will apply an extended version of the classical Circle Method. The approach requires bounding modified Kloosterman sums and Mordell integrals.</description>

      <title>Mutual position of two smooth quadrics over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two irreducible conics $C$ and $D$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ odd, we show that there are $q^2/4+O(q^{3/2})$ points $P$ in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $P$ is external to $C$ and internal to $D$. This answers a question of Korchm\'{a}ros. We also prove the analogous result for higher-dimensional smooth quadric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with $n$ odd, where the answer is $q^{n-1}/4+O(q^{n-\frac{3}{2}})$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of MacMahon-type sums of divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several new infinite families of Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by the coefficients of the generating function $U_t(a,q)$ which is an extension of MacMahon's generalized sum-of-divisors function. As a by-product, we also show that, for all $n\geq 0$, $\overline{B}_3(15n+7)\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ where $\overline{B}_3(n)$ is the number of almost $3$-regular overpartitions of $n$.</description>

      <title>On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact algorithm for computing all common subgraphs with the maximum number of vertices across multiple graphs. Our approach is further extended to handle the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), identifying the largest common subgraph in terms of either vertices or edges across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is scalable and fast.</description>
