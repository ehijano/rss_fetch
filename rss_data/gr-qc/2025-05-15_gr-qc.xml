      <title>Remembering Alexei Starobinsky -- the gentle giant of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I share fond memories of my former PhD advisor Alexei Starobinsky with whom I was closely associated for nearly 45 years. I reflect upon my early years in Moscow when I worked with him on my thesis, and touch upon the seminal work on inflation which he did during that period. Alexei visited India often and actively interacted with Indian scientists and students on issues relating to inflation, large scale structure and dark energy. This extensive collaboration, which lasted several decades, resulted in the publication of over a dozen important papers, several PhD's, and the development of the Statefinder and Om diagnostics, which I briefly discuss.</description>

      <title>Null energy condition of dynamical black holes in spatially flat FLRW space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new identity reported here for the first time is used for studying how the null energy condition can be applied to the models of dynamical black holes proposed recently [I. I. Cot\u aescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:86]. It is shown that this condition selects the models with physical meaning whose horizons evolve in accordance with the general black hole theory in frames with null coordinates [S. A. Hayward, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 49} (1994) 6467].</description>

      <title>On the universality of late-time ringdown tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late time response of vacuum black holes in General Relativity is notoriously governed by power law tails arising from the wave scattering off the curved spacetime geometry far from the black hole. While it is known that such tails are universal to a certain extent, a precise characterization of their key ingredients is missing. Here we provide an analytical proof that the tail fall-off is universal for any effective potential asymptotically decaying as $1/r^2$, while the power law decay is different if the potential decays as $1/r^\alpha$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. This result extends and revises some previous work and is in agreement with numerical analyses. Our proof is based on an analytical evaluation of the branch cut contribution to the Green function, and includes charged black holes, different kinds of perturbations, Teukolsky equation for the Kerr metric, exotic compact objects, extensions of General Relativity, and environmental effects. In the latter case, our results indicate that tails are largely insensitive to a wide range of physically motivated matter distributions around black holes, including the Navarro Frenk White profile commonly used to model dark matter.</description>

      <title>Properties of general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: circularity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse properties of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, with a particular focus on circularity -- an accidental symmetry enjoyed by the Kerr metric, and therefore widely assumed when searching for rotating black hole solutions in alternative theories of gravity as well as when constructing models of Kerr mimickers. Within a gauge specified by seven (or six) free functions, the local existence of which we prove, we solve the differential circularity conditions and translate them into algebraic relations among the metric components. This result opens the way to investigating the consequences of circularity breaking in a controlled manner. In particular, we construct two simple analytical examples of non-circular deformations of the Kerr spacetime. The first one is "minimal", since the horizon and the ergosphere are identical to their Kerr counterparts, except for the fact that the horizon is not Killing and its surface gravity is therefore not constant. The second is "not so minimal", as the horizon's profile can be chosen arbitrarily and the difference between the horizon and the so-called rotosurface can be appreciated. Our findings thus pave the way for further research into the phenomenology of non-circular stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Black hole mimickers: from theory to observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole paradigm, while remarkably successful, raises fundamental questions-both classical and quantum-about the nature of spacetime, horizons, and singularities. Black hole mimickers, horizonless ultra-compact objects, have emerged as potential alternatives that seek to resolve some of these puzzles while remaining consistent with current observational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in gravitational-wave astronomy and horizon-scale electromagnetic imaging have opened new avenues to test this paradigm-making this an opportune moment to systematically investigate such alternatives.
  This vision document presents a snapshot of the field as discussed at the Black Hole Mimickers: From Theory to Observation workshop, where experts from gravitational wave astronomy, very long baseline interferometry, numerical and mathematical relativity, and high-energy physics converged to assess the current frontiers. By highlighting key open questions and proposing concrete pathways forward, this document aims to guide future efforts to probe the nature of compact objects. As the field stands at the crossroads of theoretical innovation and observational breakthroughs, we outline strategies to harness upcoming observational capabilities to fundamentally test the black hole paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dictionary revision for mapping boundary data to bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between gravitational observables derived from scattering processes and adiabatic invariants in bound orbits, within the framework of the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, has garnered significant attention in the study of bound orbital systems. However, the existing dictionary for this correspondence produces complex-valued quantities of bound orbits that contravene physical principles in 4PM calculations, thus revealing deficiencies in the dictionary. Our research identifies a critical issue: the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitude incorporates a factor of $(p_\infty^2)^{-n/2}$ in 4PM order. This factor introduces singularities at $p_\infty^2 = 0$, thereby rendering the original dictionary become ineffective, as it assumes the possibility of connecting both scattering states and bound states at the singular point. We propose a rigorous modification by employing Hawking's method for black hole radiation, specifically analytical continuing $p_\infty^2 \rightarrow p_\infty^2 e^{-i \pi}$. We also evaluate the new dictionary by comparing the binding energy calculated using effective one-body (EOB) theory with numerical relativity (NR) simulations data from the SXS collaboration. Our findings indicate that the binding energy-angular momentum relationship to the innermost stable circular orbit derived from EOB theory is in remarkable agreement with NR data. This revised dictionary enhances the applicability of gravitational observables derived from scattering processes to bound orbits and effectively fulfills the objectives envisioned by the pioneers who proposed this correspondence.</description>

      <title>Entropy in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized First Law (GFL) and the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics are searched for effective and alternative cosmic models using the entropy as a function of the apparent area, transforming the effective cosmological model into the standard form in cosmology. The general conditions of the GSL validity are analyzed for the entropy as a general function and for logarithmic corrections to the usual Black Hole entropy. In particular, we study the GFL and the regions where the GSL is valid for an effective Loop Quantum Cosmology model with spatially flat curvature taking every possible value of the logarithmic correction factor. In addition, we explore the possibility of having negative temperature, where the validity conditions for an alternative generalized second law (AGSL) are studied.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This essay explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Letelier black hole in AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the motion of charged, neutral, and light-like particles in a magnetized black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. This spacetime admits several well-known solutions as special cases, including the Letelier-AdS black hole, the Melvin spacetime, and the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. We demonstrate that key parameters characterizing the geometry-such as the cloud of strings parameter, the magnetic field strength, and the AdS radius-significantly affect the trajectories of these particles. Our analysis shows that increasing the cloud of strings parameter weakens the gravitational influence, while the magnetic field introduces additional attractive components that can destabilize particle orbits. We examine the photon sphere and calculate the black hole shadow, showing that the shadow radius decreases with increasing magnetic field parameter but increases with the cloud of strings parameter. These findings provide potential observables for distinguishing between different black hole models in realistic astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological Evolution of a Background Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson stars, hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field, have been widely studied as a type of exotic compact object that is horizonless and provides a testing ground for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Exotic Encounters: Buchdahl's Conditions and Physical Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are among the most well-known astrophysical objects, yet their physical realisation remains conceptually subtle. We analyse physical black holes -- light-trapping regions that form in finite time as seen by a distant observer -- and investigate the properties of the matter required to support them. Taking Buchdahl's theorem as a benchmark, we show that these configurations necessarily violate at least two of its four original conditions, and the post-formation state violates them all. These violations are substantial: they include the null energy condition, non-monotonic energy profiles, and strong pressure anisotropies. Thus, the requirement of truly forming a horizon places physical black holes in a class of solutions that are more exotic than exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon behavior of nonequatorial accelerated particle motion and high energy particle collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider motion of a particle in the background of a stationary axially symmetric generic black hole. A particle experiences the action of a force of unspecified nature. We require the force to remain finite in a comoving frame. The result is expressed in terms of several integers characterizing the Taylor expansion of the metric coefficients near the horizon. We show that the polar component of the four-velocity remains finite. As a result, the scenarios of high-energy particle collisions, found previously in the context of the BSW effect for equatorial motion, do not change qualitatively in the nonequatorial case. The fact that the polar component is finite, also enables us to fill some gaps in the description of the BSW effect in previous works. Our results have a quite general character and can be used not only in description of high energy particle collisions but also in diverse astrophysical problems for which motion is not constrained by the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Evaluating statistical significance for massive black hole binary mergers with space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Important scientific discoveries should be backed by high statistical significance. In the 2030s, multiple space-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to operate. While many works aim to achieve quick and reliable detection and parameter estimation of millihertz gravitational wave sources, dedicated studies are lacking to assess the significance of space-based detectors. In this work, we propose a framework to assess the statistical significance of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) detections with space-based gravitational wave detectors. We apply this algorithm to simulated data with Gaussian stationary noise and the complex LDC-2a dataset to measure the false alarm rate and significance of MBHB signals. We also analyze factors affecting the significance of MBHBs and design a method to mitigate multi-source confusion interference. In Gaussian noise conditions, MBHBs with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 7 can achieve $3 \sigma$ significance, and those with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 8 achieve $4 \sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that all MBHB signals in the LDC-2a dataset have a significance exceeding $4.62 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Precision Joint Constraints on Cosmology and Gravity Using Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian framework to jointly constrain the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$, a key probe of deviations from general relativity, using the population characteristics of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events from binary black hole mergers. Unlike traditional methods that rely on electromagnetic counterparts or GW waveform modeling, our approach exploits the time-delay distribution and the total number of lensed events, achievable with third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we demonstrate that this method can achieve precision levels of $0.4\% - 0.7\%$ for$ H_0$ and $0.5\% - 3.3\%$ for $\gamma$ at $68\%$ credibility, significantly outperforming existing joint constraints. These results underscore the power of lensed GW population statistics as a robust and efficient probe of both cosmic expansion and the nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining Superluminal Einstein-\AE{}ther Gravity through Gravitational Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every emission of radiation in gravity also includes a non-wave-like component that leaves a permanent change in proper distances of the spacetime it travels through. This phenomenon is known as gravitational displacement memory. Building up on a recently developed computation framework that harnesses Isaacson's insights on a fundamental definition of gravitational waves, we compute the leading displacement memory formula in Einstein-Aether gravity. Our analysis represents the first direct calculation of gravitational memory in a metric theory with non-trivial asymptotic vector field value. We find that an emission of scalar and vector aether waves at a propagation speed greater than the speed of tensor radiation features unprotected causal directions with a priori unbound memory build-up. Based on the results, we conjecture a stringent exclusion of the superluminal parameter space of Einstein-Aether gravity.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the time-domain LISA response model with central finite differences and hybridization techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) response is crucial for gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis. A key computational challenge lies in evaluating time-delay interferometry (TDI) variables, which require projecting GW polarizations onto the LISA arms at different retarded times. Without approximations, the full LISA response is computationally expensive, and traditional approaches, such as the long-wavelength approximation, accelerate the response calculation at the cost of reducing accuracy at high frequencies. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid time-domain response for LISA that balances computational efficiency and accuracy across the binary's evolution. Our method implements a fast low-frequency approximation during the early inspiral$\unicode{x2013}$where most binaries spend most of the time in the sensitive frequency band of LISA$\unicode{x2013}$while reserving the computationally intensive full-response calculations for the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases. The low-frequency approximation (LFA) is based on Taylor expanding the response quantities around a chosen evaluation time such that time delays correspond to central finite differences. Our hybrid approach supports CPU and GPU implementations, TDI generations 1.5 and 2.0, and flexible time-delay complexity, and has the potential to accelerate parts of the global fit and reduce energy consumption. We also test our LFA and hybrid responses on eccentric binaries, and we perform parameter estimation for a "golden" binary. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of our low-frequency response for "deep alerts" by performing inspiral-only Bayesian inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the RT and HRT holographic entanglement entropy formulas to spacetimes with asymptotically Minkowski as well as asymptotically AdS regions. We postulate that such spacetimes represent entangled states in a tensor product of Hilbert spaces, each corresponding to one asymptotic region. We show that our conjectured formula has the same general properties and passes the same general tests as the standard HRT formula. We provide further evidence for it by showing that in many cases the Minkowski asymptotic regions can be replaced by AdS ones using a domain wall. We illustrate the use of our formula by calculating entanglement entropies between asymptotic regions in Brill-Lindquist spacetimes, finding phase transitions similar to those known to occur in AdS. We construct networks of universes by gluing together Brill-Lindquist spaces along minimal surfaces. Finally, we discuss a variety of possible extensions and generalizations, including to universes with asymptotically de Sitter regions; in the latter case, we identify an ambiguity in the homology condition, leading to two different versions of the HRT formula which we call ``orthodox'' and ``heterodox'', with different physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Extreme Compactness, Extreme Gravity: Higher-Derivative Corrections to ECOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-derivative gravity theories offer insights into the behavior of extremely compact objects (ECOs). Focusing on Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity, we derive the compactness scale in these models and demonstrate how higher-curvature corrections lead to deviations from the standard ECO compactness scale. The corrections are of order $\alpha/r_0^2$ in EGB gravity and $\alpha^2/r_0^4$ in EdGB gravity, where $\alpha$ is the coupling constant and $r_0$ is the horizon radius corresponding to the mass of the ECO. Observational constraints suggest these effects could be significant in certain astrophysical systems, providing a new perspective on the nature of extremely compact objects in models of modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the manifestly covariant quantization of quadratic gravity or higher-derivative gravity in the de Donder gauge condition (or harmonic gauge condition) for general coordinate invariance on the basis of the BRST transformation. We explicitly calculate various equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs), in particlular, the ETCRs between the metric tensor and its time derivatives in detail, and show that they are identically vanishing. We also clarify global symmetries, the physical content of quadratic gravity, and clearly show that this theory is not unitary and has a massive scalar, massive ghost and massless graviton as physical modes. Finally, we comment on confinement of the massive ghost, thereby recovering the unitarity of the physical S-matrix in quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $\kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF) $ D(t) $ obtained through a QCD analysis of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By comparing pressure profiles extracted from skewness-dependent GPDs with previous determinations based on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data, we establish updated bounds on $\kappa$. Our results show that the choice of proton pressure model significantly impacts the constraints, with the strongest limits ($|\kappa| \leq 0.10\text{--}0.3\, \text{m}^5\, \text{kg}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}$). We further demonstrate that constraints obtained based on the first and second moments of the pressure distribution yield competitive bounds compared to those derived from peak pressures or those derived from just the first moment. These findings highlight the importance of precise experimental and theoretical determinations of the proton's mechanical properties in testing alternative theories of gravity. The present study motivates future improvements in GPD reconstructions for stronger constraints on EiBI gravity and related modifications.</description>

      <title>The Dual Primordial Black Hole Formation Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a novel mechanism where two families of primordial black holes (PBHs) may form at nearly the same comoving scales but at two different epochs. It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. In this case, smaller PBHs form when the comoving scale of interest re-enters the horizon during the break period, and larger PBHs form when the scale re-enters the horizon after inflation. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and the dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA and DECIGO. Our work thus provides a unified observational window into the physics of inflation, reheating, and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures in black hole accretion: Pair production in dynamical magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks around black holes host extreme conditions where general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics dominate. These disks exhibit two distinct dynamical regimes -- Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) and Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD). In the MAD regime, these systems exhibit magnetic fields up to $10^8$ G and variability on gravitational timescales $t_g \sim 10^{-4}$ s for stellar-mass black holes. While classical magnetohydrodynamics has been extensively applied, quantum effects in these high-energy environments remain unexplored. Here, we employ quantum field theory in background gauge fields (QFTBGF) to demonstrate that the dynamic magnetic fields of MADs drive significant pair production via the Schwinger mechanism. The resulting pairs emit non-thermal (synchrotron) radiation with a peak frequency tunable across $ \sim 1 - 3000$ MHz, depending on the magnetic field strength (peaking at higher frequencies for stronger fields). For $ B \sim 10^8 $ G, our model predicts a peak spectral flux density of $ \sim 1 - 100$ mJy, detectable with next-generation radio telescopes (e.g., SKA, ngVLA). This work provides a direct and observable signatures of quantum effects in black hole accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Simulating jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with no artificial atmosphere limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, exploring the conditions to launch relativistic outflows compatible with gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. Employing an unprecedentedly low numerical density floor decreasing as the sixth power of radial distance, we obtain for the first time an evolution where such a floor has no effect on any outflow produced during and after merger. In models forming an accreting black hole (BH) 25 ms after merger, incipient jets are launched with terminal Lorentz factors and Poynting-flux luminosities compatible with GRBs. The rather high jet velocities reached in a few tens of ms, when compared to previous simulations adopting a much higher and uniform density floor, show the importance of removing any influence of the latter as the jet evolves toward increasingly large time and spatial scales. In absence of collapse, we find the emergence of much heavier and slower polar outflows, incapable of producing a GRB. We thus favor a BH origin for GRB jets.</description>

      <title>When Dark Matter Heats Up: A Model-Independent Search for Non-Cold Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) without relying on any parametric approach. In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and model-independent reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although statistically mild, cannot be conclusively ruled out. Notably, we observe a tendency toward a negative $w_{\rm DM}$ at the present epoch, a result that is particularly intriguing and may have meaningful implications for modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental effects in gravitational wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Our results highlight the unique potential of modelling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lukash metric is a homogeneous gravitational wave which at late times approximates the behaviour of a generic class of spatially homogenous cosmological models with monotonically decreasing energy density. The transcription from Brinkmann to Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen (BJR) to Bianchi coordinates is presented and the relation to a Sturm-Liouville equation is explained. The 6-parameter isometry group is derived. In the Bianchi VII range of parameters we have two BJR transciptions. However using either of them induces a mere relabeling of the geodesics and isometries. Following pioneering work of Siklos, we provide a self-contained account of the geometry and global structure of the spacetime. The latter contains a Killing horizon to the future of which the spacetime resembles an anisotropic version of the Milne cosmology and to the past of which it resemble the Rindler wedge.</description>

Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.</description>

      <title>Constraining the effective field theory of dark energy with multimessenger astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory of dark energy predicts a possible time variation of the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GW) which could be tested with multimessenger astronomy. For this purpose we derive the relation between the redshift dependence of the propagation speed of GWs and the time delay between the detection of GWs and electromagnetic waves (EMWs) emitted by the same source. According to the EFT the friction term of the GW propagation equation depends on the effective Planck mass and GW speed time variation, affecting the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio. We compute the general form of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio in terms of the effective GW speed and effective Planck mass, and then focus on theories with constant Planck mass (CPM) and time varying GW speed. For CPM theories the GW speed can be jointly constrained by the GW-EMW detection time delay and luminosity distance ratio, allowing to derive a consistency relation between these two observables. The event GW170817 and its EM counterpart satisfy the CPM consistency condition, and allows to set constraints on the time variation of the GWs speed, and consequently on the coefficients of the effective theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

      <title>Static vacuum 3+1 black holes that cannot be put into stationary rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that some of the static Myers/Korotkin-Nicolai (MKN) vacuum 3+1 static black holes cannot be put into stationary rotation. Namely, they cannot be deformed into axisymmetric stationary vacuum black holes with non-zero angular momentum. We also prove that this occurs in particular for those MKN solutions for which the distance along the axis between the two poles of the horizon is sufficiently small compared to the square root of its area. The MKN solutions, sometimes called periodic Schwarzschild, are physically regular, have no struts or singularities, but are asymptotically Kasner.
  The static rigidity presented here appears to be the first in the literature of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Reduced geometry and its role in explicit spacetime symmetry violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompatibility of explicit diffeomorphism violation with Riemannian geometry within the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME) is revisited. We review two methods of how to deal with this problem. The first is based on an approach proposed originally by St\"{u}ckelberg and the latter is to restrict spacetime geometry via the dynamical field equations and the second Bianchi identities. Moreover, a third technique is introduced in this work, which relies on isometries of a gravitational system. Our conclusion is that an SME background field configuration compatible with Riemannian geometry is more likely to be determined the more diffeomorphisms are isometries of the particular system. The proposal is demonstrated to work for cosmological time evolution with the SME backgrounds $u$ and $s^{\mu\nu}$ present. This finding has the potential to provide an alternative treatment of explicit spacetime symmetry violation in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{\cal R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{\cal R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of gravitational waves microlensed by spherically symmetric potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anticipated observation of the gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves (GWs) promises to shed light on a host of astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, extracting the parameters of the lens from the modulated GWs requires accurate modeling of the lensing amplification factor, accounting for wave-optics effects. Analytic solutions to the lens equation have not been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models. While numerical solutions to this equation have been developed, the time and computational resources required to evaluate the amplification factor numerically make large-scale parameter estimation of the lens (and source) parameters prohibitive. On the other hand, surrogate modeling of GWs has proven to be a powerful tool to accurately, and rapidly, produce GW templates at arbitrary points in parameter space, interpolating from a finite set of available waveforms at discrete parameter values. In this work, we demonstrate that surrogate modeling can also effectively be applied to the evaluation of the time-domain microlensing amplification factor $\widetilde{F}(t)$. We show this by constructing $\widetilde{F}(t)$ for two lens models, viz. point-mass lens, and singular isothermal sphere, which notably includes logarithmic divergence behaviour. We find both surrogates reproduce the original lens models accurately, with mismatches $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$ across a range of plausible microlensed binary black hole sources observed by the Einstein Telescope. This surrogate is between 5 and $10^3$ times faster than the underlying lensing models, and can be evaluated in about 100 ms. The accuracy and efficiency attained by our surrogate models will enable practical parameter estimation analyses of microlensed GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs regarding the detection of compact binary mergers via gravitational waves opened up a new window to the Universe. Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision, making accurate waveform models crucial in describing these systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform models informed by observational data. Using mock data representing a one-year operation of the Einstein Telescope as our baseline, we demonstrate how the results improve as more events are included in the calibration. This method offers a new and complementary approach for developing sophisticated gravitational-wave models compared to classical techniques that employ analytical computations and numerical-relativity simulations. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation.</description>

Abstract: We describe the scattering of particles by a sandwich gravitational wave generated during a flyby using an analytical approach. The derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking is approximated by the hyperbolic scarf potential, which allows for an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev about certain ``magical" amplitudes of the potential.</description>

      <title>Scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration gravitational waves from compact binaries using short Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework based on short Fourier transforms (SFTs) to analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and parallelizable implementation of the gravitational wave inner product, a core operation of gravitational wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise nonstationarities, data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a nonoptimized approach. We release public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and hardware-accelerated reimplementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner product is the key building block of all gravitational wave data treatments; by speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely promising solution for current and future gravitational wave data-analysis problems.</description>

Abstract: The convergence of scalar-tensor gravity to general relativity, or the departure from it, are described in a new analogy with heat dissipation in a viscous fluid. This new thermal picture is applied to cosmology, shedding light on whether gravity deviates from general relativity early on and approaches it later in the cosmic history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is noteworthy that limiting compactness of a static bounded configuration is characterized by a general principle: \textit{one, by equipartition of mass between inside and outside, and the other by vanishing of energy inside.} The former implies gravitational energy being half of mass leading to limiting compactness $M/R = 4/9$ of Buchdahl star while for the latter, the two are equal giving $M/R = 1/2$ of black hole with horizon. \emph{This is the relativistic Virial theorem respectively for massive and massless particles.} It is remarkable that it prescribes that there can exist only two equilibrium states which also define limiting compactness of the object. Consequently, it leads to a profound prediction that the ultimate endproduct of gravitational collapse could only be one of the two, Buchdahl star or black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute by means of post-Newtonian (PN) methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical perturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates. The perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is carefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of the ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is considered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques applied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive new analytic, static, symmetric black hole solutions in theories involving dark photons with minimal and higher-order magnetic dipole interactions. Starting from the effective non-relativistic potential between fermions mediated by a dark photon, we derive explicit corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry induced by dark photon and spin-dependent terms. These corrections alter the metric significantly at short distances, modifying the horizon radius, Hawking temperature, photon sphere, and consequently, the black hole shadow. Employing perturbative expansions, we provide analytic expressions for the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution, highlighting an exponential suppression controlled by the dark photon mass. Our results demonstrate that higher-order magnetic dipole interactions produce distinctive spin-dependent curvature terms, amplifying gravitational effects near the horizon. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future phenomenological tests of dark photon models through gravitational wave astronomy and black hole imaging, while highlighting dark photons' role as mediators of dark matter interactions that can influence structure formation and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>

      <title>Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron &amp; Dilaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits. A companion paper will discuss additional details and relations to previously studied self-dual black holes.</description>

Abstract: After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such an environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector without event horizon</title>

Abstract: We investigate unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of operators in quantum field theory in the cases where there is a Fock representation of the commutation relations. We examine more closely the operational definition of a measurement device, discussing the Unruh-DeWitt and Glauber models of quantum detectors. The transition probability per unit of proper time of both detectors in different non-inertial frames of reference in Minkowski spacetime is evaluated. We first study detectors traveling in a stationary worldline with a constant proper acceleration, i.e., a hyperbolic motion, interacting with the field prepared in the Poincar\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. Next, we study the Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest in a non-uniformly accelerated frame, with a time dependent acceleration interacting with the field in the Poincar\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. We evaluate the positive frequency Wightman function for the non-uniformly accelerated frame in a finite time interval and find that it is similar to the two-point correlation function of a system in equilibrium with a thermal bath. Calculating the transition rate, the non-uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector can be excited even if the scalar field is prepared in the vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Robustness of dark energy phenomenology across different parameterizations</title>

Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral through Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and EM radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D GRMHD framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through photon emission. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ~200 orbits, starting from a separation of 20r_g and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have shown how mass continues to flow toward the binary even after the binary "decouples" from its surrounding disk, but the accretion rate onto the black holes diminishes. We have identified how the minidisks orbiting each black hole are slowly drained and eventually dissolve as the binary compresses. We confirm previous findings that the system's luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few during inspiral; however, we observe an abrupt increase by ~50% in this quantity at the time of merger, likely accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, we have demonstrated that during the inspiral, fluid ram pressure regulates the fraction of the magnetic flux transported to the binary that attaches to the black holes' horizons.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Towards a Composite Framework for Simultaneous Exploration of New Physics in Background and Perturbed Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM by independently parameterizing modifications in the background evolution and the growth of structures. The background is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to $A=\Omega_{m0}$ and $B=2/3$ in the $\Lambda$CDM limit, while deviations in the growth of structures are captured through a fitting function for $f\sigma_8$ involving the growth index $\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets involving background expansion and growth of structures (related to observations involving redshift space distortions), we find significant evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM in the background expansion whereas there is no finite evidence for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in the growth of structures. This suggests that with the current precision in observational data involving background and perturbed Universe, a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour is confirmed (as shown in the recent DESI-DR2 results). But whether this deviation is due to an evolving Dark Energy or due to the modification of gravity at cosmological scales is still an open question, largely due to less precise data from perturbed Universe. We further demonstrate how the future high-precision growth data (from Euclid, for example) can answer such question using a forecast study.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>
