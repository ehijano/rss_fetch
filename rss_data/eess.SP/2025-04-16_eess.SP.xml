      <title>Accelerated Recovery with RIS: Designing Wireless Resilience in Mission-Critical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G and beyond redefine connectivity, wireless networks become the foundation of critical operations, making resilience more essential than ever. With this shift, wireless systems cannot only take on vital services previously handled by wired infrastructures but also enable novel innovative applications that would not be possible with wired systems. As a result, there is a pressing demand for strategies that can adapt to dynamic channel conditions, interference, and unforeseen disruptions, ensuring seamless and reliable performance in an increasingly complex environment. Despite considerable research, existing resilience assessments lack comprehensive key performance indicators (KPIs), especially those quantifying its adaptability, which are vital for identifying a system's capacity to rapidly adapt and reallocate resources. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the adaption performance by augmenting the gradient of the system's rate function. To further enhance the network resilience, we integrate Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) into our framework due to their capability to dynamically reshape the propagation environment while providing alternative channel paths. Numerical results show that gradient augmentation enhances resilience by improving adaptability under adverse conditions while proactively preparing for future disruptions.</description>

      <title>An Energy-efficient Ordered Transmission-based Sequential Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation problems in wireless sensor networks typically involve gathering and processing data from distributed sensors to infer the state of an environment at the fusion center. However, not all measurements contribute significantly to improving estimation accuracy. The ordered transmission protocol, a promising approach for enhancing energy efficiency in wireless networks, allows for the selection of measurements from different sensors to ensure the desired estimation quality. In this work, we use the idea of ordered transmission to reduce the number of transmissions required for sequential estimation within a network, thereby achieving energy-efficient estimation. We derive a new stopping rule that minimizes the number of transmissions while maintaining estimation accuracy similar to general sequential estimation with unordered transmissions. Moreover, we derive the expected number of transmissions required for both general sequential estimation with unordered transmissions and proposed sequential estimation with ordered transmissions and make a comparison between the two systems. Simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme can efficiently reduce transmissions while still ensuring the quality of estimation.</description>

      <title>ESC-MVQ: End-to-End Semantic Communication With Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel end-to-end digital semantic communication framework based on multi-codebook vector quantization (VQ), referred to as ESC-MVQ. Unlike prior approaches that rely on end-to-end training with a specific power or modulation scheme, often under a particular channel condition, ESC-MVQ models a channel transfer function as parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with trainable bit-flip probabilities. Building on this model, ESC-MVQ jointly trains multiple VQ codebooks and their associated bit-flip probabilities with a single encoder-decoder pair. To maximize inference performance when deploying ESC-MVQ in digital communication systems, we devise an optimal communication strategy that jointly optimizes codebook assignment, adaptive modulation, and power allocation. To this end, we develop an iterative algorithm that selects the most suitable VQ codebook for semantic features and flexibly allocates power and modulation schemes across the transmitted symbols. Simulation results demonstrate that ESC-MVQ, using a single encoder-decoder pair, outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods in both performance and memory efficiency, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for realizing digital semantic communication in diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <title>EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.</description>

      <title>Properties of Near Field Focusing for Cylindrical Dipole Arrays in Enclosed Array Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by large intelligent surface applications, the electric field properties of near field focusing using phase conjugation method are analyzed for cylindrical dipole arrays. Firstly, for the transmitting antennas featuring vertical polarization, the polarization characteristic is decomposed along the x, y, and z directions. Three typical cases are studied when the focal points are at (xf , 0, 0), (0, yf , 0), and (0, 0, zf ). When the length of the cylindrical dipole array is significantly larger compared to its radius, certain unique insights emerge. When the focal point is positioned along (0, 0, zf ), apart from the region on both sides, the ratio between Ez and Ex/Ey remains {\pi}/2. Additionally, When the focal point is located within the cylinder, the electric field of each polarization is approximately the same everywhere. In other words, beam focusing does not incur losses due to different positions. The focusing resolution of Ez is the same in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Different from the situation where the 3 - dB focal beam depth is much smaller than the focal beam width for the most of arrays, the resolution in the longitudinal can be improved, respectively. Through a comprehensive grasp of these design principles, we can gain a deeper understanding of the specific areas with significant potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-task Edge Sensing via Task-oriented Joint Information Gathering and Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advance of edge computing technology enables significant sensing performance improvement of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In particular, an edge server (ES) is responsible for gathering sensing data from distributed sensing devices, and immediately executing different sensing tasks to accommodate the heterogeneous service demands of mobile users. However, as the number of users surges and the sensing tasks become increasingly compute-intensive, the huge amount of computation workloads and data transmissions may overwhelm the edge system of limited resources. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a scalable edge sensing framework for multi-task execution, in the sense that the computation workload and communication overhead of the ES do not increase with the number of downstream users or tasks. By exploiting the task-relevant correlations, the proposed scheme implements a unified encoder at the ES, which produces a common low-dimensional message from the sensing data and broadcasts it to all users to execute their individual tasks. To achieve high sensing accuracy, we extend the well-known information bottleneck theory to a multi-task scenario to jointly optimize the information gathering and broadcast processes. We also develop an efficient two-step training procedure to optimize the parameters of the neural network-based codecs deployed in the edge sensing system. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the considered representative benchmark methods in multi-task inference accuracy. Besides, the proposed scheme is scalable to the network size, which maintains almost constant computation delay with less than 1% degradation of inference performance when the user number increases by four times.</description>

      <title>Channel-Adaptive Robust Resource Allocation for Highly Reliable IRS-Assisted V2X Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of resource allocation in vehicular networks enhanced by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS), considering the uncertain Channel State Information (CSI) typical of vehicular environments due to the Doppler shift. Leveraging the 3GPP's Mode 1 cellular V2X architecture, our system model facilitates efficient subcarrier usage and interference reduction through coordinated V2I and V2V communications. Each Cellular User Equipment (CUE) shares its spectrum with at most one Vehicular User Equipment (VUE) in a one-to-one reuse pattern. We formulate a joint optimization problem for vehicular transmit power, Multi-User Detection (MUD) matrices, V2V link spectrum reuse, and IRS reflection coefficients in IRS-aided V2X communication with imperfect CSI. To tackle this, a novel robust resource allocation algorithm is developed by first decomposing the problem into manageable sub-problems such as power allocation, MUD matrices optimization and IRS phase shifts, and then using the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method to alternately optimize these subproblems for optimal resource allocation. Our contributions include efficient approaches for self-learning based power allocation and phase shift optimization that adapt to CSI uncertainties, significantly enhancing the reliability and efficiency of vehicular communications. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in improving the Quality of Service (QoS) and managing the complex interference inherent in dense vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Secure RSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel data-dependent interleaving technique designed to enhance the security of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks by protecting the common stream from eavesdropping threats. Specifically, we exploit the RSMA structure by interleaving the common bits of each user based on a sequence derived from their private bits. By decoding its private stream, the legitimate receiver reconstructs the interleaving sequence set by the transmitter and successfully de-interleaves the common stream. Therefore, the common part is successfully prevented from being intercepted by an eavesdropper who is unable to deduce the dynamic changing interleaving permutations. To ensure dynamic interleaving sequences, a private bit selection approach that balances the trade-off between security and system efficiency is proposed. Simulation findings confirm the effectiveness of the suggested method, showing notable security improvements while maintaining robust overall system reliability.</description>

      <title>A Novel Splitter Design for RSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) has firmly established itself as a powerful methodology for multiple access, interference management, and multi-user strategy for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel channel-dependent splitter design for multi-carrier RSMA systems, aimed at improving reliability performance. Specifically, the proposed splitter leverages channel state information and the inherent structure of RSMA to intelligently replicate segments of the private stream data that are likely to encounter deep-faded subchannels into the common stream. Thus, the reliability is enhanced within the same transmission slot, minimizing the need for frequent retransmissions and thereby reducing latency. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using key performance metrics, including achievable sum rate, average packet delay, and bit error rate (BER), under both perfect and imperfect channel estimation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Super-LoRa, a novel approach to enhancing the throughput of LoRa networks by leveraging the inherent robustness of LoRa modulation against interference. By superimposing multiple payload symbols, Super-LoRa significantly increases the data rate while maintaining lower transmitter and receiver complexity. Our solution is evaluated through both simulations and real-world experiments, showing a potential throughput improvement of up to 5x compared to standard LoRa. This advancement positions Super-LoRa as a viable solution for data-intensive IoT applications such as smart cities and precision agriculture, which demand higher data transmission rates.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Bayesian Inference on High-Rate Sensor Data: Applications in Automotive Radar and Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have been studied and developed primarily in the context of natural images and computer vision. This has spurred the development of (Bayesian) methods that use these generative models for inverse problems in image restoration, such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. In recent years, generative modeling for Bayesian inference on sensory data has also gained traction. Nevertheless, the direct application of generative modeling techniques initially designed for natural images on raw sensory data is not straightforward, requiring solutions that deal with high dynamic range signals acquired from multiple sensors or arrays of sensors that interfere with each other, and that typically acquire data at a very high rate. Moreover, the exact physical data-generating process is often complex or unknown. As a consequence, approximate models are used, resulting in discrepancies between model predictions and the observations that are non-Gaussian, in turn complicating the Bayesian inverse problem. Finally, sensor data is often used in real-time processing or decision-making systems, imposing stringent requirements on, e.g., latency and throughput. In this paper, we will discuss some of these challenges and offer approaches to address them, all in the context of high-rate real-time sensing applications in automotive radar and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Interacting Object-Enabled Clustering and Characterization of Distributed MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), also known as cell-free massive MIMO, emerges as a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) systems to support uniform coverage and reliable communication. For the design and optimization of such systems, measurement-based investigations of real-world distributed MIMO channels are essential. In this paper, we present an indoor channel measurement campaign, featuring eight distributed antenna arrays with 128 elements in total. Multi-link channels are measured at 50 positions along a 12-meter user route. A clustering algorithm enabled by interacting objects is proposed to identify clusters in the measured channels. The algorithm jointly clusters the multipath components for all links, effectively capturing the dynamic contributions of common clusters to different links. In addition, a Kalman filter-based tracking framework is introduced for cluster prediction, tracking, and updating along the user movement. Using the clustering and tracking results, cluster-level characterization of the measured channels is performed. First, the number of clusters and their visibility at both link ends are analyzed. Next, a maximum-likelihood estimator is utilized to determine the entire cluster visibility region length. Finally, key cluster-level properties, including the common cluster ratio, cluster power, shadowing, spread, among others, are statistically investigated. The results provide valuable insights into cluster behavior in typical multi-link channels, necessary for accurate modeling of distributed MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Mobile Distributed MIMO (MD-MIMO) for NextG: Mobility Meets Cooperation in Distributed Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D\mbox{-}MIMO) is a promising technology to realize the promise of massive MIMO gains by fiber-connecting the distributed antenna arrays, thereby overcoming the form factor limitations of co-located MIMO. In this paper, we introduce the concept of mobile D-MIMO (MD-MIMO) network, a further extension of the D-MIMO technology where distributed antenna arrays are connected to the base station with a wireless link allowing all radio network nodes to be mobile. This approach significantly improves deployment flexibility and reduces operating costs, enabling the network to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of next-generation (NextG) networks. We discuss use cases, system design, network architecture, and the key enabling technologies for MD-MIMO. Furthermore, we investigate a case study of MD-MIMO for vehicular networks, presenting detailed performance evaluations for both downlink and uplink. The results show that an MD-MIMO network can provide substantial improvements in network throughput and reliability.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis of Multipath Characteristics in Indoor Distributed Massive MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), also known as cell-free massive MIMO, has emerged as a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This letter introduces an indoor channel measurement campaign designed to explore the behavior of multipath components (MPCs) in distributed massive MIMO channels. Fully coherent channels were measured between eight distributed uniform planar arrays (128 elements in total) and a 12-meter user equipment route. Furthermore, a method is introduced to determine the order (single- or multi-bounce) of MPC interaction by leveraging map information and MPC parameters. In addition, a Kalman filter-based framework is used for identifying the MPC interaction mechanisms (reflection or scattering/diffraction/mixed). Finally, a comprehensive MPC-level characterization is performed based on the measured channels, including the significance of the single-bounce MPCs, the spherical wavefront features, the birth-and-death processes of the MPCs, and the spatial distribution of reflections. The findings serve as a valuable reference for understanding MPC propagation behavior, which is necessary for accurate modeling of indoor distributed massive MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Beam Misalignment in 3GPP mmWave NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating beam misalignment in 3GPP mmWave NR systems implementing analog beamforming. Our approach captures the interaction between user mobility, beam sweeping mechanisms, and deployment configurations, focusing on long-term average performance metrics. Specifically, we model the beam misalignment rates at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) as Poisson processes and derive expressions for the expected misalignment duration, misalignment fraction, and overall beamforming gain. The framework accounts for practical constraints in NR such as Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB) periodicity, TDD frame structures, and SSB overhead. Through numerical evaluation based on 3GPP mmWave parameters, we identify key trade-offs between beam counts, user mobility, and SSB timing, providing actionable design insights for robust and efficient beam management in future high-frequency networks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Universal Vibration Analysis Dataset: A Framework for Transfer Learning in Predictive Maintenance and Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ImageNet has become a reputable resource for transfer learning, allowing the development of efficient ML models with reduced training time and data requirements. However, vibration analysis in predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis, lacks a comparable large-scale, annotated dataset to facilitate similar advancements. To address this, a dataset framework is proposed that begins with bearing vibration data as an initial step towards creating a universal dataset for vibration-based spectrogram analysis for all machinery. The initial framework includes a collection of bearing vibration signals from various publicly available datasets. To demonstrate the advantages of this framework, experiments were conducted using a deep learning architecture, showing improvements in model performance when pre-trained on bearing vibration data and fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. These findings highlight the potential to parallel the success of ImageNet in visual computing but for vibration analysis. For future work, this research will include a broader range of vibration signals from multiple types of machinery, emphasizing spectrogram-based representations of the data. Each sample will be labeled according to machinery type, operational status, and the presence or type of faults, ensuring its utility for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Additionally, a framework for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training specific to vibration data will be developed. This framework will standardize methodologies across the research community, allowing for collaboration and accelerating progress in predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, and related fields. By mirroring the success of ImageNet in visual computing, this dataset has the potential to improve the development of intelligent systems in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Driven Neural Beamforming with Imperfect CSI in Urban Macro Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The literature is abundant with methodologies focusing on using transformer architectures due to their prominence in wireless signal processing and their capability to capture long-range dependencies via attention mechanisms. In particular, depthwise separable convolutions enhance parameter efficiency for the process of high-dimensional data characteristics of MIMO systems. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning framework that integrates depthwise separable convolutions and transformers to generate beamforming weights under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system in dense urban environments. The primary goal is to enhance throughput by maximizing sum-rate while ensuring reliable communication. Spectral efficiency and block error rate (BLER) are considered as performance metrics. Experiments are carried out under various conditions to compare the performance of the proposed NNBF framework against baseline methods zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over the baseline techniques.</description>

      <title>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) is a promising paradigm that is designed to concurrently support a variety of heterogeneous services, extending beyond sensing and communication to meet the diverse needs of emerging applications. However, a primary challenge of IHSP is addressing the conflicts between multiple competing service demands under constrained resources. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA design and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming (MODP) algorithm to obtain its optimal solution. Additionally, we develop the VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to efficiently find its suboptimal solution. Finally, simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA 3.1: Non-Coherent-Detection-Based Non-Reciprocal Scattering Matrix Estimation Leveraging a Tunable Load Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the recently introduced "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique to remove the need for coherent detection. The resulting "Virtual VNA 3.1" technique can unambiguously estimate the full scattering matrix of a non-reciprocal, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using an $N_\mathrm{A}$-channel coherent wavefront generator and an $N_\mathrm{A}$-channel non-coherent detector, where $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$. Waves are injected and received only via a fixed set of $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" DUT ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" DUT ports are terminated by a specific tunable load network. To resolve all ambiguities, an additional modified setup is required in which waves are injected and received via a known $2N_\mathrm{A}$-port system connected to the DUT's accessible ports. We experimentally validate our method for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$ considering a non-reciprocal eight-port circuit as DUT. By eliminating the need for coherent detection, our work reduces the hardware complexity which may facilitate applications to large-scale or higher-frequency systems. Additionally, our work provides fundamental insights into the minimal requirements to fully and unambiguously characterize a non-reciprocal DUT.</description>

      <title>Mind2Matter: Creating 3D Models from EEG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.Our code is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.</description>

      <title>The CAM Model: An in vivo Testbed for Molecular Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) research increasingly focuses on biomedical applications like health monitoring and drug delivery, demanding testing in realistic living environments. Elevating MC research requires developing advanced in vivo testbeds. We introduce the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model as the first versatile 3D in vivo MC platform. The CAM, a highly vascularized membrane in fertilized chicken eggs, is established in bioengineering, cancer research, and drug development. Its biological realism, reproducibility, and versatility make it ideal for next-generation MC testbeds, bridging proof-of-concept systems and practical applications. We comprehensively characterize the CAM model's properties and MC system relevance. Through experimental studies, we investigate fluorescent molecule distribution in the CAM's closed-loop vascular system. We derive an analytical model using the wrapped normal distribution to describe particle propagation in dispersive closed-loop systems dominated by diffusion and flow. Parametric models are developed to approximate particle dynamics in the CAM, with parameters estimated via nonlinear least squares curve fitting. A dataset of 69 regions from 25 eggs validates our models. We analyze parameter relationships and biological plausibility. Finally, we develop a parametric model for long-term particle behavior and liver accumulation in chick embryos.</description>

      <title>ECG-Chat: A Large ECG-Language Model for Cardiac Disease Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the medical auxiliary field shows great potential, allowing patients to engage in conversations using physiological signal data. However, general MLLMs perform poorly in cardiac disease diagnosis, particularly in the integration of ECG data analysis and medical report generation, mainly due to the complexity of ECG data analysis and the gap between text and ECG signal modalities. To address these issues, we propose ECG-Chat, a multitask MLLMs focused on ECG medical report generation, providing multimodal conversational capabilities based on cardiology knowledge. We propose a contrastive learning approach that integrates ECG waveform data with text reports, aligning ECG features with reports in a fine-grained manner. This method also results in an ECG encoder that excels in zero-shot report retrieval tasks. Additionally, expanding existing datasets, we constructed a 19k ECG diagnosis dataset and a 25k multi-turn dialogue dataset for training and fine-tuning ECG-Chat, which provides professional diagnostic and conversational capabilities. Furthermore, ECG-Chat can generate comprehensive ECG analysis reports through an automated LaTeX generation pipeline. We established a benchmark for the ECG report generation task and tested our model on multiple baselines. ECG-Chat achieved the best performance in classification, retrieval, and medical report generation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/YubaoZhao/ECG-Chat.</description>

      <title>A Radio Map Approach for Reduced Pilot CSI Tracking in Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant potential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) acquisition remains a key challenge. Existing works on CSI estimation and radio map applications typically rely on stationary CSI statistics and accurate location labels. However, the CSI process can be discontinuous due to user mobility and environmental variations, and inaccurate location data can degrade the performance. By contrast, this paper studies radio-map-embedded CSI tracking and radio map construction without the assumptions of stationary CSI statistics and precise location labels. Using radio maps as the prior information, this paper develops a radio-map-embedded switching Kalman filter (SKF) framework that jointly tracks the location and the CSI with adaptive beamforming for sparse CSI observations under reduced pilots. For radio map construction without precise location labels, the location sequence and the channel covariance matrices are jointly estimated based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An unbiased estimator on the channel covariance matrix is found. Numerical results on ray-traced MIMO channel datasets demonstrate that using 1 pilot in every 10 milliseconds, an average of over 97% of capacity over that of perfect CSI can be achieved, while a conventional Kalman filter (KF) can only achieve 76%. Furthermore, the proposed radio-map-embedded CSI model can reduce the localization error from 30 meters from the prior to 6 meters for radio map construction.</description>

      <title>WiFi-Diffusion: Achieving Fine-Grained WiFi Radio Map Estimation With Ultra-Low Sampling Rate by Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, at every point across a large geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization for a large area, particularly critical for the unlicensed WiFi spectrum. The problem of fine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by sparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. This problem is challenging due to the ultra-low sampling rate, where the number of available samples is far less than the fine-grained resolution required for radio map estimation. We propose WiFi-Diffusion -- a novel generative framework for achieving fine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models. WiFi-Diffusion employs the creative power of generative AI to address the ultra-low sampling rate challenge and consists of three blocks: 1) a boost block, using prior information such as the layout of obstacles to optimize the diffusion model; 2) a generation block, leveraging the diffusion model to generate a candidate set of radio maps; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best radio map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by WiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art (SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion achieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the sampling rate required by SOTA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic non-cooperative analysis of intercepted radar signals is essential for intelligent equipment in both military and civilian domains. Accurate modulation identification and parameter estimation enable effective signal classification, threat assessment, and the development of countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a symbolic approach for radar signal recognition and parameter estimation based on a vision-language model that combines context-free grammar with time-frequency representation of radar waveforms. The proposed model, called Sig2text, leverages the power of vision transformers for time-frequency feature extraction and transformer-based decoders for symbolic parsing of radar waveforms. By treating radar signal recognition as a parsing problem, Sig2text can effectively recognize and parse radar waveforms with different modulation types and parameters. We evaluate the performance of Sig2text on a synthetic radar signal dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing and parsing radar waveforms with varying modulation types and parameters. The training code of the model is available at https://github.com/Na-choneko/sig2text.</description>

Abstract: The prediction of traffic congestion can serve a crucial role in making future decisions. Although many studies have been conducted regarding congestion, most of these could not cover all the important factors (e.g., weather conditions). We proposed a prediction model for traffic congestion that can predict congestion based on day, time and several weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity). To evaluate our model, it has been tested against the traffic data of New Delhi. With this model, congestion of a road can be predicted one week ahead with an average RMSE of 1.12. Therefore, this model can be used to take preventive measure beforehand.</description>

      <title>On the convergence result of the gradient-push algorithm on directed graphs with constant stepsize</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization has recieved a lot of interest due to its wide applications in various fields. It consists of multiple agents that connected by a graph and optimize a total cost in a collaborative way. Often in the applications, the graph of the agents is given by a directed graph. The gradient-push algorithm is a fundamental method for distributed optimization for which the agents are connected by a directed graph. Despite of its wide usage in the literatures, its convergence property has not been established well for the important case that the stepsize is constant and the domain is the entire space. This work proves that the gradient-push algorithm with stepsize $\alpha&gt;0$ converges exponentially fast to an $O(\alpha)$-neighborhood of the optimizer if the stepsize $\alpha$ is less than a specific value. For the result, we assume that each cost is smooth and the total cost is strongly convex. Numerical experiments are provided to support the theoretical convergence result. \textcolor{black}{We also present a numerical test showing that the gradient-push algorithm may approach a small neighborhood of the minimizer faster than the Push-DIGing algorithm which is a variant of the gradient-push algorithm involving the communication of the gradient informations of the agents.</description>

      <title>Block Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation and Application to $\beta$-NMF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Block Majorization Minimization method with Extrapolation (BMMe) for solving a class of multi-convex optimization problems. The extrapolation parameters of BMMe are updated using a novel adaptive update rule. By showing that block majorization minimization can be reformulated as a block mirror descent method, with the Bregman divergence adaptively updated at each iteration, we establish subsequential convergence for BMMe. We use this method to design efficient algorithms to tackle nonnegative matrix factorization problems with the $\beta$-divergences ($\beta$-NMF) for $\beta\in [1,2]$. These algorithms, which are multiplicative updates with extrapolation, benefit from our novel results that offer convergence guarantees. We also empirically illustrate the significant acceleration of BMMe for $\beta$-NMF through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>RISE-iEEG: Robust to Inter-Subject Electrodes Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is increasingly used for clinical and brain-computer interface applications due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. However, inter-subject variability in electrode implantation poses a challenge for developing generalized neural decoders. To address this, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust to Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a participant-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual participants onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple participants' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each participant. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Music Reconstruction dataset, and AJILE12 dataset, surpasses that of advanced iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is about 7\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 0.83, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, Our analysis of the projection network weights reveals that the Superior Temporal and Postcentral lobes are key encoding nodes for the Music Reconstruction and AJILE12 datasets, which aligns with the primary physiological principles governing these regions. This model improves decoding accuracy while maintaining interpretability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Shuffled Linear Regression via Spectral Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shuffled linear regression (SLR) seeks to estimate latent features through a linear transformation, complicated by unknown permutations in the measurement dimensions. This problem extends traditional least-squares (LS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches by jointly estimating the permutation, resulting in shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO formulations. Existing methods, constrained by the combinatorial complexity of permutation recovery, often address small-scale cases with limited measurements. In contrast, we focus on large-scale SLR, particularly suited for environments with abundant measurement samples. We propose a spectral matching method that efficiently resolves permutations by aligning spectral components of the measurement and feature covariances. Rigorous theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves accurate estimates in both shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO settings, given a sufficient number of samples. Furthermore, we extend our approach to address simultaneous pose and correspondence estimation in image registration tasks. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world image registration scenarios show that our method outperforms existing algorithms in both estimation accuracy and registration performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Hybrid Bit and Generative Semantic Communications in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework consisting of hybrid bit-level and generative semantic communications for efficient downlink image transmission within space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</description>

      <title>Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.</description>
