      <title>Interaction between Returns and Order Flow Imbalances: Endogeneity, Intraday Variations, and Macroeconomic News Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study examines the interaction between returns and order flow imbalances (differences between buy and sell orders), constructed from the best bid and offer files of S&amp;P 500 E-mini futures contract, using a structural vector autoregressive model. The intraday variation in market activity is considered by applying the model for each short interval each day, whereas the endogeneity due to time aggregation is handled by estimating the structural parameters via the identification through heteroskedasticity. The estimation results show that significant endogeneity exists and that the estimated parameters and impulse responses exhibit significant intraday variations, reflecting intense or mild order submission activities. Further, the estimated parameters change around macroeconomic news announcements, suggesting inactive order submission periods exist when they occur. Overall, such announcement effects are mostly explained by the order submission activities reflecting the public information.</description>

      <title>Prediction of high-frequency futures return directions based on the mean uncertainty classification methods: An application in China's future market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the prediction of short-term average return directions in China's high-frequency futures market. As minor fluctuations with limited amplitude and short duration are typically regarded as random noise, only price movements of sufficient magnitude qualify as statistically significant signals. Therefore data imbalance emerges as a key problem during predictive modeling. From the view of data distribution imbalance, we employee the mean-uncertainty logistic regression (mean-uncertainty LR) classification method under the sublinear expectation (SLE) framework, and further propose the mean-uncertainty support vector machines (mean-uncertainty SVM) method for the prediction. Corresponding investment strategies are developed based on the prediction results. For data selection, we utilize trading data and limit order book data of the top 15 liquid products among the most active contracts in China's future market. Empirical results demonstrate that comparing with conventional LR-related and SVM-related imbalanced data classification methods, the two mean-uncertainty approaches yields significant advantages in both classification metrics and average returns per trade.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fees for Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive liquidity providers (LPs) in automated market makers (AMMs) face losses due to adverse selection (LVR), which static trading fees often fail to offset in practice. We study the key determinants of LP profitability in a dynamic reduced-form model where an AMM operates in parallel with a centralized exchange (CEX), traders route their orders optimally to the venue offering the better price, and arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies. Using large-scale simulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market conditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal AMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving these relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the model's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges: fees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient revenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market conditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX and remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee protects passive LPs from severe losses. These findings suggest that a threshold-type dynamic fee schedule is both robust enough to market conditions and improves LP outcomes.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</description>
