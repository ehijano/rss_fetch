      <title>Crash Consistency in DRAM-NVM-Disk Hybrid Storage System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NVM is used as a new hierarchy in the storage system, due to its intermediate speed and capacity between DRAM, and its byte granularity. However, consistency problems emerge when we attempt to put DRAM, NVM, and disk together as an efficient whole. In this paper, we discuss the challenging consistency problems faced by heterogeneous storage systems, and propose our solution to the problems. The discussion is based on NVPC as a case study, but can be inspiring and adaptive to all similar heterogeneous storage systems.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Assisted Virtualization of Neural Processing Units for Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud platforms today have been deploying hardware accelerators like neural processing units (NPUs) for powering machine learning (ML) inference services. To maximize the resource utilization while ensuring reasonable quality of service, a natural approach is to virtualize NPUs for efficient resource sharing for multi-tenant ML services. However, virtualizing NPUs for modern cloud platforms is not easy. This is not only due to the lack of system abstraction support for NPU hardware, but also due to the lack of architectural and ISA support for enabling fine-grained dynamic operator scheduling for virtualized NPUs.
  We present TCloud, a holistic NPU virtualization framework. We investigate virtualization techniques for NPUs across the entire software and hardware stack. TCloud consists of (1) a flexible NPU abstraction called vNPU, which enables fine-grained virtualization of the heterogeneous compute units in a physical NPU (pNPU); (2) a vNPU resource allocator that enables pay-as-you-go computing model and flexible vNPU-to-pNPU mappings for improved resource utilization and cost-effectiveness; (3) an ISA extension of modern NPU architecture for facilitating fine-grained tensor operator scheduling for multiple vNPUs. We implement TCloud based on a production-level NPU simulator. Our experiments show that TCloud improves the throughput of ML inference services by up to 1.4$\times$ and reduces the tail latency by up to 4.6$\times$, while improving the NPU utilization by 1.2$\times$ on average, compared to state-of-the-art NPU sharing approaches.</description>
