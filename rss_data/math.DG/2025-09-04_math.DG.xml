      <title>On linking numbers and Biot-Savart kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact manifold, the solutions of the initial value problem for the heat equation with currential initial conditions are smooth families of forms for $t&gt;0$. If the initial condition is an exact submanifold $L$ then the integral in $t$ of this family gives a smooth form $\Omega$ on the complement of $L$ such that $\omega:=d^*\Omega$ is a solution for the exterior derivative equation $d\omega=L$. We introduce, for small $t$, an asymptotic approximation of these solutions in order to show that $d^*\Omega$ is extendible to the oriented blow-up of $L$ in codimension $1$ and $3$ and also $2$ when $L$ is minimal. When $L$ is the diagonal in $M\times M$ we adapt these ideas to obtain a differential linking form for any compact, ambient Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $3$. This coincides up to sign with the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator $d^*G$ and recovers the well-known Gauss formula for linking numbers in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Mass Lower Bounds for Asymptotically Locally Flat Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish positive mass type theorems for asymptotically locally flat (ALF) manifolds, which have asymptotic ends modeled on circle bundles over a Euclidean base with fibers of constant length. In particular for dimensions $n\leq 7$, the mass of AF manifolds is shown to be nonnegative under the assumption of nonnegative scalar curvature if a codimension-two coordinate sphere in the asymptotic end is trivial in homology, with zero mass achieved only for the product $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\times S^1$. The same conclusions are obtained in dimension four for ALF manifolds admitting an almost free $U(1)$ action. Moreover, in this setting the mass is shown to be bounded below by a multiple of the degree of the circle bundle at infinity. This is the first such result illustrating how nontrivial topology of the end contributes to the mass.</description>

      <title>Analysis on asymmetric metric measure spaces: $q$-heat flow, $q$-Laplacian and Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate geometric analysis on metric measure spaces equipped with asymmetric distance functions. Extending concepts from the symmetric case, we introduce upper gradients and corresponding $L^q$-energy functionals as well as $q$-Laplacian in the asymmetric setting. Along the lines of gradient flow theory, we then study $q$-heat flow as the $L^2$-gradient flow for $L^q$-energy. We also study the Sobolev spaces over asymmetric metric measure spaces, extending some results of Ambrosio--Gigli--Savar\'e to asymmetric distances. A wide class of asymmetric metric measure spaces is provided by irreversible Finsler manifolds, which serve to construct various model examples by pointing out genuine differences between the symmetric and asymmetric settings.</description>

      <title>Geodesics on Grushin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider higher-dimensional generalizations of the $\alpha$-Grushin plane, focusing on the problem of classification of geodesics that minimize length, also known as optimal synthesis. Solving Hamilton's equations on these spaces using the calculus of generalized trigonometric functions, we obtain explicit conjugate times for geodesics starting at a Riemannian point. From symmetries in the geodesic structure, we propose a conjectured cut time, and prove that it provides an upper bound on the first conjugate time, a key step in the extended Hadamard technique. In the three-dimensional case, we combine this method with a density argument to establish the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Singular Sets of Riemannian Exponential Maps in Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the singular sets for the Lagrangian solution maps of the two-dimensional inviscid Euler and generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations are Gaussian null sets. To achieve this we carry out a spectral analysis of an operator related to the coadjoint representation of the algebra of divergence-free vector fields on the fluid domain. In particular, we establish sharp results on the Schatten-von Neumann class to which this operator belongs. Furthermore, its failure to be compact is directly connected to the absence of Fredholm properties of the corresponding Lagrangian solution maps. We show that, for the three-dimensional Euler equations and the standard surface quasi-geostrophic equation, this failure is in fact essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that stable solutions $u:\mathbb{R}^4\to (-1,1)$ to the Allen-Cahn equation with bounded energy density (or equivalently, with cubic energy growth) are one-dimensional.
  This is known to entail important geometric consequences, such as robust curvature estimates for stable phase transitions, and the multiplicity one and Morse index conjectures of Marques-Neves for Allen-Cahn approximations of minimal hypersurfaces in closed 4-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ropelength of a knot or link is the minimal number of inches of 1-inch-thick rope that it takes to tie it. The relationship of this measurement to knot and link invariants has been studied by various authors. We give the first results of this type for higher-dimensional spherical links, generalizing work of the first author and Michaelides in the classical case. We find optimal asymptotic bounds on their Milnor invariants in terms of thickness, uncovering a dichotomy between a polynomial and an exponential regime. Along the way, we give a detailed treatment of these Milnor invariants and their properties using Massey products. As an application, we resolve a question of Freedman and Krushkal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rational homology ellipsoids are certain Liouville domains diffeomorphic to rational homology balls and having Lagrangian pin-wheels as their skeleta. From the point of view of almost toric fibrations, they are a natural generalisation of usual symplectic ellipsoids. We study symplectic embeddings of rational homology ellipsoids into the complex projective plane and we show that for each Markov triple, this problem gives rise to an infinite staircase. A key ingredient in the proof is the result that any two such embeddings are Hamiltonian isotopic. We also prove constraints on sizes for pairs of disjoint embeddings.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness for the Bartnik Stationary Extension Problem near Schwarzschild Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Bartnik stationary extension conjecture, which arises from the definition of the spacetime Bartnik mass for a compact region in a general initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. This conjecture posits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat stationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \mathfrak{g}, \Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\partial M$, consisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of the spacetime extrinsic curvature $\Pi$.
  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the static case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum Einstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and transport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded in an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\theta$. Our approach employs both a geodesic gauge for the quotient metric $g$ in the quotient formalism and a $\theta$-geodesic gauge for the $1$-form $\theta$.
  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension problem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in a Schwarzschild ${t=0}$ slice, including data with arbitrarily small mean curvature. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations decouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously solved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\theta$ is treated independently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the Bochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in arXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical harmonic decomposition of $\theta$.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{K}$-cowaist on complete foliated manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.08354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,F)$ be a connected (not necessarily compact) foliated manifold carrying a complete Riemannian metric $g^{TM}$. We generalize Gromov's $\mathrm{K}$-cowaist using the coverings of $M$, as well as defining a closely related concept called the $\widehat{\mathrm{A}}$-cowaist. Let $k^F$ be the associated leafwise scalar curvature of $g^F = g^{TM}|_F$. We obtain some estimates on $k^F$ using these two concepts. In particular, assuming that the generalized $\mathrm{K}$-cowaist is infinity and either $TM$ or $F$ is spin, we show that $\inf(k^F)\leq 0$.</description>

      <title>Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16286v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove some Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds with nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. In particular, we give a sharp Willmore type inequality in steady gradient Ricci solitons. We also prove a sharp Willmore-like inequality in shrinking gradient Ricci solitons. Moreover, we characterize the equality cases of Willmore-type inequalities. These results can be regarded as weighted versions of Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri's Willmore-type inequality. As applications, we derive some sharp isoperimetric type inequalities in weighted manifolds under the existence assumption of a critical set of weighted isoperimetric functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caffarelli-Hardt-Simon used the minimal surface equation on the Simons cone $C(S^3\times S^3)$ to generate newer examples of minimal hypersurfaces with isolated singularities. Hardt-Simon proved that every area-minimizing quadratic cone $\mathcal{C}$ having only an isolated singularity can be approximated by a unique foliation of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ by smooth, area-minimizing hypersurfaces asymptotic to $\mathcal C$. This paper uses methods similar to Caffareli-Hardt-Simon to solve the minimal surface equation for the Hardt-Simon surfaces in the sphere for some boundary values. We use gluing methods to construct minimal surfaces over Hardt-Simon surfaces and near quadratic cones.</description>

Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

More precisely, we study resonant structures, a particular type of $(G,X)$-structures, via the Ehresmann-Thurston principle, and their link with the deformation of the complex structure of the LVM manifold in the sense of Kodaira, Spencer and Kuranishi. We describe the Kuranishi family of these manifolds and construct a family containing all of them and complete at every point.</description>

      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical. This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case.
  This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Toric geometry of generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a local equivalence between toric steady K\"ahler-Ricci solitons and $A$-type toric generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (GKRS). Under natural global conditions we show this equivalence extends to complete GKRS, yielding a general construction of new examples in all dimensions. We show that in four dimensions, all GKRS are either described by the generalized K\"ahler Gibbons-Hawking ansatz, or have split tangent bundle, or are $A$-type toric. This yields a local classification in four dimensions, together with a conjecturally exhaustive construction of complete symplectic-type examples.</description>

      <title>On the principal eigenvalue of the truncated Laplacian, and submanifolds with bounded mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the principal eigenvalue $\mu(\mathscr{F}_k^-,E)$ of the fully nonlinear operator
  \[
  \mathscr{F}_k^-[u] = \mathcal{P}_k^-(\nabla^2 u) - h |\nabla u|
  \] on a set $E \Subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where $h \in [0,\infty)$ and $\mathcal{P}_k^-(\nabla^2 u)$ is the sum of the smallest $k$ eigenvalues of the Hessian $\nabla^2 u$. We prove a lower estimate for $\mu(\mathscr{F}_k^-,E)$ in terms of a generalized Hausdorff measure $\mathscr{H}_\Psi(E)$, for suitable $\Psi$ depending on $k$, moving some steps in the direction of the conjecturally sharp estimate
  \[
  \mu(\mathscr{F}_k^-,E) \ge C \mathscr{H}^k(E)^{-2/k}.
  \] The theorem is used to study the spectrum of bounded submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$, improving on our previous work in the direction of a question posed by S.T. Yau. In particular, the result applies to solutions of Plateau's problem for CMC surfaces.</description>

      <title>Limits of asymptotically Fuchsian surfaces in a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Let $\nu_{Gr(M)}$ denote the probability volume (Haar) measure of the 2-plane Grassmann bundle $Gr(M)$ of $M$ and let $\nu_T$ denote the area measure on $Gr(M)$ of an immersed closed totally geodesic surface $T\subset M$. We say a sequence of $\pi_1$-injective maps $f_i:S_i\to M$ of surfaces $S_i$ is asymptotically Fuchsian if $f_i$ is $K_i$-quasifuchsian with $K_i\to 1$ as $i\to \infty$. We show that the set of weak-* limits of the probability area measures induced on $Gr(M)$ by asymptotically Fuchsian minimal or pleated maps $f_i:S_i\to M$ of closed connected surfaces $S_i$ consists of all convex combinations of $\nu_{Gr(M)}$ and the $\nu_T$.</description>

      <title>Causal Classification of Pathological Misner-Type Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate three causality-violating spacetimes: Misner space (including Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model), the pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, and a new model introduced here, the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. Despite their different physical origins -- ranging from a flat vacuum solution to a black-hole-type vacuum solution to a non-vacuum model requiring exotic matter -- all three share a common warped-product structure, $2$-dimensional cylindrical base metrics of Eddington-Finkelstein type, and fundamental causal features such as Cauchy and chronology horizons, acausal regions, and analogous geodesic behaviour. Building on a conjecture first proposed in 2016, we present a formal proof that the three models are pairwise isocausal on their universal covers and on suitable causally regular regions of their compactified forms. The proof is constructive, providing explicit causal bijections on the covers and identifying a concrete deck-equivariance criterion governing descent to the compactified spacetimes: if the equivariance degree satisfies $|k|=1$ the models are globally isocausal, whereas if $|k|&gt;1$ or equivariance fails, then at most a one-way causal relation holds between the compactified models. These results supply a rigorous causal classification linking these spacetimes, placing them within a unified Misner-type family and providing a framework for extending the classification to other causality-violating solutions.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>

      <title>Self-intersecting curves on a pair of pants and periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character variety $\mathscr{X}(S,G)$ associated to an oriented compact surface $S$ with boundary and a real reductive Lie group $G$ admits a Poisson structure and is foliated by symplectic leaves. When $G$ is a matrix group, any closed curve $c\in\pi_1(S)$ induces a trace function $\mathsf{tr}_c\colon[\rho]\mapsto \mathsf{tr}(\rho(c))$ on $\mathscr{X}(S,G)$. In this article, we study the Hamiltonian flows of trace functions associated to self-intersecting curves. We prove that when $G=\mathsf{PSL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ and $S$ is the pair of pants, every orbit of the Hamiltonian flow of the trace of a figure eight curve on $S$ is periodic and has a unique fixed point. The proof uses explicit computations in Fock-Goncharov coordinates. As an application, we prove a similar statement for the trace of the $\Theta$-web. Finally, we focus on the symplectic leaf corresponding to the unipotent locus, and derive similar results for two more self-intersecting curves: the commutator, and a curve going $k$ times around a boundary component.</description>
