      <title>Identification of Z Cam's Historical Counterpart: The Quest for an Ancient Nova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent astronomical discussions, attempts have been made to link the known dwarf nova Z Cam to historical celestial events, particularly the "guest star" phenomenon reported in China in 77 BCE. Despite other suggestions and the problems with regard to the location of the event in 77 BCE, its identification with Z Cam is used in the Variable Star IndeX (VSX) of the AAVSO and in several research papers that aim to derive knowledge on the evolution of cataclysmic variables. Through the reconstruction of the super-constellation of the Purple Palace in the Han Dynasty, we found that Z Cam is actually located outside this enclosure, contradicting the records of the 77 BCE guest star being "within the Purple Palace". With newly found text versions of the guest star in 77 BCE, we narrowed down the position given therein. Combined with a new analysis of accompanying divination text leads to the conclusion that this guest star was actually a comet. Finally, through meticulous examination and comparison, we conclude that the guest star of 369 CE appears the most plausible candidate for Z Cam's historical counterpart, aligning with both textual evidence and modern astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on the Physics of Late-Type Stars from Beyond Low Earth Orbit, the Moon and Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the new discoveries enabled thanks to the recent space missions, stellar physics is going through a revolution. However, these discoveries opened the door to many new questions that require more observations. The European Space Agency's Human and Robotic Exploration programme provides an excellent opportunity to push forward the limits of our knowledge and better understand stellar structure and dynamics evolution. Long-term observations, Ultra-Violet observations, and a stellar imager are a few highlights of proposed missions for late-type stars that will enhance the already planned space missions.</description>

      <title>CLAP. I. Resolving miscalibration for deep learning-based galaxy photometric redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining well-calibrated photometric redshift probability densities for galaxies without a spectroscopic measurement remains a challenge. Deep learning discriminative models, typically fed with multi-band galaxy images, can produce outputs that mimic probability densities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. However, such models may be affected by miscalibration that would result in discrepancies between the model outputs and the actual distributions of true redshifts. Our work develops a novel method called the Contrastive Learning and Adaptive KNN for Photometric Redshift (CLAP) that resolves this issue. It leverages supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN) to construct and calibrate raw probability density estimates, and implements a refitting procedure to resume end-to-end discriminative models ready to produce final estimates for large-scale imaging data. The harmonic mean is adopted to combine an ensemble of estimates from multiple realisations for improving accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that CLAP takes advantage of both deep learning and KNN, outperforming benchmark methods on the calibration of probability density estimates and retaining high accuracy and computational efficiency. With reference to CLAP, we point out that miscalibration is particularly sensitive to the method-induced excessive correlations among data instances in addition to the unaccounted-for epistemic uncertainties. Reducing the uncertainties may not guarantee the removal of miscalibration due to the presence of such excessive correlations, yet this is a problem for conventional deep learning methods rather than CLAP. These discussions underscore the robustness of CLAP for obtaining photometric redshift probability densities required by astrophysical and cosmological applications. This is the first paper in our series on CLAP.</description>

Abstract: The Roberts linkage is recognized for enabling long-period pendulum motion in a compact format. Utilizing this characteristic, we are developing a three-point Roberts linkage for vibration isolation systems, with an eye towards its potential contribution to the development of next-generation interferometric gravitational wave antennas. In this article, we derived the equations to determine the essential parameters when using this linkage as a vibration isolation system, namely the equivalent pendulum length and the relationship between translational motion of the center of mass and rigid body rotation, from size parameters. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior in response to various errors.</description>

      <title>Profiling Near-Surface Winds on Mars Using Attitude Data from Mars 2020 Ingenuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used attitude data from the Mars Ingenuity helicopter with a simple steady-state model to estimate windspeeds and directions at altitudes of 3 meters up to 24 meters, the first time winds at such altitudes have been probed on Mars. We compared our estimates to concurrent wind data at 1.5 m height from the meteorology package MEDA onboard the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and to predictions from meteorological models. Wind directions inferred from the Ingenuity data agreed to within uncertainties with the directions measured by MEDA, when the latter were available, but deviated from model-predicted directions by as much as 180 deg in some cases. Also, the inferred windspeeds are often much higher than expected. For example, meteorological predictions tailored to the time and location of Ingenuity's 59th flight suggest Ingenuity should not have seen windspeeds above about 15 m/s, but we inferred speeds reaching nearly 25 m/s. By contrast, the 61st flight was at a similar time and season and showed weaker winds then the 59th flight, suggesting winds shaped by transient phenomena. For flights during which we have MEDA data to compare to, inferred windspeeds imply friction velocities exceeding 1 m/s and roughness lengths of more than 10 cm based on a boundary layer model that incorporates convective instability, which seem implausibly large. These results suggest Ingenuity was probing winds sensitive to aerodynamic conditions hundreds of meters upwind instead of the conditions very near Mars 2020, but they may also reflect a need for updated boundary layer wind models. An improved model for Ingenuity's aerodynamic response that includes the effects of transient winds may also modify our results. In any case, the work here provides a foundation for exploration of planetary boundary layers using drones and suggests important future avenues for research and development.</description>

      <title>Observed Gravitational-Wave Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA experiments now regularly witness gravitational waves from compact binary mergers: the relativistic collisions of neutron stars and/or stellar-mass black holes. With hundreds of such events observed to date, gravitational-wave observations are enabling increasingly precise surveys of the demographics of merging compact binaries, including the distributions of their masses, rotation rates, and positions throughout the Universe. This article will provide an overview of our observational knowledge of the compact binary population, as it stands today. I will discuss, in turn, observations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers, describing what is currently known (or not yet known) about these different gravitational-wave sources. I will highlight emerging classes of binaries that do not fall cleanly into any of these existing categories. And I will conclude by reviewing the methodology by which population analyses of gravitational-wave sources are performed.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b's Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerosols are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and leave clear spectral imprints in exoplanet spectra. Pre-JWST, exoplanet retrieval frameworks mostly adopted simple parametric approximations. With JWST, we now have access to mid-infrared wavelengths where aerosols have detectable composition-specific resonance features. Here, we implement new features into the open-source atmospheric retrieval code POSEIDON to account for the complex scattering, reflection, and absorption properties of Mie scattering aerosols. We provide an open-source database of these Mie scattering cross sections and optical properties. We also extend the radiative transfer and retrieval functionality in POSEIDON to include multiple scattering reflection and emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate these new retrieval capabilities on archival Hubble and Spitzer transmission and secondary eclipse spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We find that a high-altitude, low-density, thin slab composed of sub-micron particles is necessary to fit HD 189733 b's transmission spectrum, with multiple aerosol species providing a good fit. We additionally retrieve a sub-solar H$_2$O abundance, a sub-solar K abundance, and do not detect CO$_2$. Our joint thermal and reflection retrievals of HD 189733 b's secondary eclipse spectrum, however, finds no evidence of dayside aerosols, a sub-solar dayside H$_2$O abundance, enhanced CO$_2$, and slighty sub-solar alkali abundances. We additionally explore how retrieval model choices, such as cloud parameterization, aerosol species and properties, and thermal structure parameterization affect retrieved atmospheric properties. Upcoming JWST data for hot Jupiters like HD 189733 b will be well suited to enable deeper exploration of aerosol properties, allowing the formulation of a self-consistent, multi-dimensional picture of cloud formation processes.</description>

      <title>An independent hybrid imaging of Sgr A* from the data in EHT 2017 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the ring structure found by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) as the black hole shadow of Sgr A*is an artifact by the bumpy PSF (Point Spread Function) of the EHT2017. The imaging using sparse u-v data requires detailed scrutiny of the PSF. The estimated shadow diameter (48.7 +- 7 muas) is equal to the spacing between the main beam and the first sidelobe of the PSF (49.09 muas), which immediately suggests a potential problem in the deconvolution of the PSF. We show that the ring image can be derived from non-ring simulated datasets (noise only; point source) with a narrow Field-of-View (FOV) and an assumed self-calibration suggesting the EHT2017's u-v coverage is insufficient for reliable imaging. The EHTC analysis, based on calibrations with assumptions about the source's size and properties, selected the final image by prioritizing appearance rate of the similar structure from a large imaging parameter space over data consistency. Our independent analysis with the conventional hybrid mapping reveals an elongated east-west structure, consistent with previous observations. We believe it to be more reliable than the EHTC image, due to half the residuals in normalized visibility amplitude. The eastern half is brighter, possibly due to a Doppler boost from the rapid rotating disk. We hypothesize our image shows a portion of the accretion disk about 2 to a few Rs away from the black hole, rotating with nearly 60 % of the speed of light viewed from an angle of 40 -45 degrees.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise Ratio Analytic Formulae of the Inspiral Massive Black Hole Binaries in TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries are one of the important sources for the TianQin project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio squared during the inspiral phase of massive black hole binaries exhibits a direct proportionality to the ratio of the observation duration to the time remaining until coalescence. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for massive black hole binaries. In this paper, we demonstrated this relationship under both all-sky average and non-average conditions. The latter introduces only an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a simple estimation method with an error margin of within 2%.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Estimation for CSST Survey with LSTM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) is crucial for cosmological surveys. Various methods have been developed for this purpose, such as template fitting methods and machine learning techniques, each with its own applications, advantages, and limitations. In this study, we propose a new approach that utilizes a deep learning model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict photo-$z$. Unlike many existing machine learning models, our method requires only flux measurements from different observed filters as input. The model can automatically learn the complex relationships between the flux data across different wavelengths, eliminating the need for manually extracted or derived input features, thereby providing precise photo-$z$ estimates. The effectiveness of our proposed model is evaluated using simulated data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) sourced from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST-ACS) and the COSMOS catalog, considering anticipated instrument effects of the future CSST. Results from experiments demonstrate that our LSTM model, compared to commonly used template fitting and machine learning approaches, requires minimal input parameters and achieves high precision in photo-$z$ estimation. For instance, when trained on the same dataset and provided only with photometric fluxes as input features, the proposed LSTM model yields one-third of the outliers $f_{out}$ observed with a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) model, while the normalized median absolute deviation $\rm \sigma_{NMAD}$ is only two-thirds that of the MLP model. This study presents a novel approach to accurately estimate photo-$z$s of galaxies using photometric data from large-scale survey projects.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Assessing methods for telluric removal on atmospheric retrievals of high-resolution optical exoplanetary transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in ultra-stable ground-based high-resolution spectrographs have propelled ground-based astronomy to the forefront of exoplanet detection and characterisation. Retrieving accurate atmospheric parameters depends on accurate modelling and removal of the telluric contamination while preserving the faint underlying exoplanet signal. There exist many methods to model telluric contamination, whether directly modelling the Earth's transmission spectrum via radiative transfer modelling, or using a principal component analysis (PCA)-like reconstruction to fit the time-invariant features of a spectrum. We aimed to assess the efficacy of these various telluric removal methods in preserving the underlying exoplanetary spectra. We compared two of the most common telluric modelling and removal methods, molecfit and the PCA-like algorithm SysRem, using planetary transmission spectra injected into three high-resolution optical observations taken with ESPRESSO. These planetary signals were injected at orbital periods of P = 2 days and 12 days, resulting in differing changes in radial velocity during transit. We then retrieved various injected atmospheric model parameters in order to determine the efficacy of the telluric removal methods. For the close-in, high velocity injected signal, we found that SysRem performed better for species that are also present in the Earth's atmosphere across each of the datasets. As we moved to slower moving signals at larger orbital separations, for one of the three datasets, SysRem dampened the planetary H$_2$O signal. In contrast, the H$_2$O signal was preserved for the telluric modelling method, molecfit. However, this behaviour was not ubiquitous across all three of the injected datasets, with another dataset showing a more precise H$_2$O/Fe ratio when preprocessed with SysRem.</description>

      <title>Combining REBOUND and MESA: Dynamical Evolution of Planets Orbiting Interacting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although planets have been found orbiting binary systems, whether they can survive binary interactions is debated. While the tightest-orbit binaries should host the most dynamically stable and long-lived circumbinary planetary systems, they are also the systems that are expected to experience mass transfer, common envelope evolution, or stellar mergers. In this study, we explore the effect of stable non-conservative mass transfer on the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets. We present a new script that seamlessly integrates binary evolution data from the 1D binary stellar evolution code MESA into the N-body simulation code REBOUND. This integration framework enables a comprehensive examination of the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets orbiting mass-transferring binaries, while simultaneously accounting for the detailed stellar structure evolution. In addition, we introduce a recalibration method to mitigate numerical errors from updates of binary properties during the system's dynamical evolution. We construct a reference binary model in which a $2.21\, M_\odot$ star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope through non-conservative mass transfer to the $1.76\, M_\odot$ companion star, creating a $0.38\,M_\odot$ subdwarf. We find the tightest stable orbital separation for circumbinary planets to be $\simeq 2.5$ times the binary separation after mass transfer. Accounting for tides by using the interior stellar structure, we find that tidal effects become apparent after the rapid mass transfer phase and start to fade away during the latter stage of the slow mass transfer phase. Our research provides a new framework for exploring circumbinary planet dynamics in interacting binary systems.</description>

      <title>PolyCLEAN: Atomic Optimization for Super-Resolution Imaging and Uncertainty Estimation in Radio Interferometry</title>

Abstract: Aims: We address two issues for the adoption of convex optimization in radio interferometric imaging. First, a method for a fine resolution setup is proposed which scales naturally in terms of memory usage and reconstruction speed. Second, a new tool to localize a region of uncertainty is developed, paving the way for quantitative imaging in radio interferometry.
  Methods: The classical $\ell_1$ penalty is used to turn the inverse problem into a sparsity-promoting optimization. For efficient implementation, the so-called Frank-Wolfe algorithm is used together with a \textit{polyatomic} refinement. The algorithm naturally produces sparse images at each iteration, leveraged to reduce memory and computational requirements. In that regard, PolyCLEAN reproduces the numerical behavior of CLEAN while guaranteeing that it solves the minimization problem of interest. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the \textit{dual certificate image}, which appears as a numerical byproduct of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This image is proposed as a tool for uncertainty quantification on the location of the recovered sources.
  Results: PolyCLEAN demonstrates good scalability performance, in particular for fine-resolution grids. On simulations, the Python-based implementation is competitive with the fast numerically-optimized CLEAN solver. This acceleration does not affect image reconstruction quality: PolyCLEAN images are consistent with CLEAN-obtained ones for both point sources and diffuse emission recovery. We also highlight PolyCLEAN reconstruction capabilities on observed radio measurements.
  Conclusions: PolyCLEAN can be considered as an alternative to CLEAN in the radio interferometric imaging pipeline, as it enables the use of Bayesian priors without impacting the scalability and numerical performance of the imaging method.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of space-based detectors with time-delay interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate sky localization of gravitational wave (GW) sources is an important scientific goal for space-based GW detectors. The main differences between future space-based GW detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and TianQin, include the time-changing orientation of the detector plane, the arm length, the orbital period of the spacecraft and the noise curve. Because of the effects of gravity on three spacecraft, it is impossible to maintain the equality of the arm length, so the time-delay interferometry (TDI) method is needed to cancel out the laser frequency noise for space-based GW detectors. Extending previous work based on equal-arm Michelson interferometer, we explore the impacts of different first-generation TDI combinations and detector's constellations on the sky localization for monochromatic sources. We find that the sky localization power is almost unaffected by the inclusion of the TDI Michelson $(X, Y, Z)$ combination in the analysis. We also find that the variation in the sky localization power for different TDI combinations is entirely driven by the variation in the sensitivities of these combinations. For the six particular TDI combinations studied, the Michelson $(X, Y, Z)$ combination is the best for source localization.</description>

      <title>On joint analysing XMM-NuSTAR spectra of active galactic nuclei</title>

Abstract: A recently released XMM-Newton technical note has revealed a significant calibration issue between NuSTAR and XMM-Newton EPIC, and provided an empirical correction to EPIC effective area. To quantify the bias caused by the calibration issue to joint analysis of XMM-NuSTAR spectra and verify the effectiveness of the correction, in this work we perform joint-fitting of NuSTAR and EPIC-pn spectra for a large sample of 104 observation pairs of 44 X-ray bright AGN. The spectra were extracted after requiring perfect simultaneity between XMM-Newton and NuSTAR exposures (merging GTIs from two missions) to avoid bias due to rapid spectral variability of AGN. Before the correction, the EPIC-pn spectra are systematically harder than corresponding NuSTAR spectra by $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.1$, subsequently yielding significantly underestimated cutoff energy $E_{\rm cut} $ and the strength of reflection component R when performing joint-fitting. We confirm the correction is highly effective and can commendably erase the discrepancy in best-fit $\Gamma$, $E_{\rm cut} $ and R, and thus we urge the community to apply the correction when joint-fitting XMM-NuSTAR spectra. Besides, we show that as merging GTIs from two missions would cause severe loss of NuSTAR net exposure time, in many cases joint-fitting yields no advantage compared with utilizing NuSTAR data alone. We finally present a technical note on filtering periods of high background flares for XMM-Newton EPIC-pn exposures in the Small Window mode.</description>

      <title>Prospects of constraining on the polarizations of gravitational waves from binary black holes using space- and ground-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of general relativity (GR) predicts the existence of gravitational waves (GWs) with two tensor modes, while alternative theories propose up to six polarization modes. In this study, we investigate constraints on GW polarization using a model-independent parametrized post-Einsteinian framework and consider both space- and ground-based detectors. By evaluating the capabilities and network performance of LISA, Taiji, TianQin, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the Einstein Telescope (ET), we analyze their respective contributions. Among space-based detectors, Taiji provides the most stringent constraints compared with LISA and TianQin.Regarding ground-based detectors, LIGO excels in vector modes while ET offers comprehensive constraints across all polarization modes. In network scenarios, LISA+TJm performs best, and ET surpasses second-generation detector combinations. Furthermore, multiband observations effectively mitigate scalar mode degeneracies thereby significantly enhancing the performance of ground-based detectors. Ultimately, combined space- and ground-based observations provide robust constraints on GW polarizations that advance tests for deviations from GR. Our findings underscore the potential of future GW missions in refining our understanding of gravitational physics through precise measurements of polarizations.</description>
