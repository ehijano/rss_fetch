      <title>Analysis of Information Digestion Differences among Players in Online C2C Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the magnitude of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) markets have grown significantly, highlighting the increasing significance of trust between buyers and sellers. However, the specific aspects of product information that facilitate effective communication and trust building in C2C markets remain poorly understood. This study examines the concept of information digestion-the process through which information is accurately understood-and aims to elucidate differences in the information digestion processes of sellers and buyers to clarify the role of product page information. To address this, we conducted two experiments: a questionnaire survey involving 400 subjects and a conjoint analysis with eye-tracking for 15 participants. Initially, we selected eight sample products from four distinct product categories based on the Foote, Cone, and Belding (FCB) grid and compared the product information components considered important by sellers and buyers. Subsequently, we created 12 types of product pages that varied in the combination of four attributes: title, price, product description, and image. Experiment 1 revealed significant differences in the perceived importance of product page components between buyers and sellers. It also demonstrated that product categories and transaction experience influenced the importance assigned to these components, particularly for buyers. Results from Experiment 2 showed that buyers prioritize product descriptions and identified two distinct buyer groups based on their information digestion patterns: one that carefully reads and digests information and another that processes information more rapidly. These findings enhance our understanding of trust-building mechanisms in online C2C markets and provide practical insights for platform designers and market participants.</description>

      <title>The evolving boundary of green technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green patents are a key indicator to track technological efforts aimed at fighting climate change. Using an original dataset that merges different Patstat releases, we identify three mechanisms that may bias green patent statistics, potentially leading to contradictory findings. First, patent reclassifications due to updates in (green) classification codes result in an 9.2\% increase in the number of green patents when using the most recent classification structure. Second, delays in the adoption of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) system introduce regional biases, as approximately 10\% of green patents from late-adopting countries remain undetected in less recent versions of the database. Third, we provide evidence that quality thresholds used to identify high-value inventions significantly shape observed trends in green patenting. Analyzing these mechanisms, our paper reveals that in many studies a substantial number of green patents is systematically overlooked, with the strongest effects observed for recent years and patents originating from Asian patent offices. These findings lead to relevant policy implications. Our results indicate not only that the global rate of green innovation has accelerated, but also that its epicenter has shifted, with an increasing share of green patents originating from emerging technological leaders, particularly in Asia.</description>

      <title>Smart treaties: A path to binding agreements in international relations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we create binding agreements between nations? Recently, scholars have argued that blockchain technology enables us to do so. Given that this could greatly affect the anarchical world order implied by state sovereignty, this remarkable claim is investigated thoroughly. By focusing on the technical implementation of smart contracts between nations, this article finds that the potential to create binding agreements using blockchain technology is far more limited than recently suggested.</description>

      <title>Securing the supply of graphite for batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for graphite in batteries, particularly for electric vehicles, has led to concerns around supply chain security. Currently, over 92% of global anode material is produced in China, posing a geopolitical risk for other countries reliant on graphite supply for domestic industries. This paper assesses the costs of producing battery-grade graphite (natural and synthetic) in the US and China using process-based cost models. We find that production costs in the US significantly exceed those in China due to higher capital intensity and input costs. Our analysis reveals that a majority of modeled projects in the US are not competitive at current market prices. We identify key cost drivers, including capital costs, economies of scale, and input material prices, and explore pathways to improve the competitiveness of US graphite production, such as supportive financing and process innovation directions. The analysis of conventional graphite production costs at scale also informs ceiling costs for alternative, promising pathways such as methane pyrolysis and catalytic graphitization. This study highlights the challenges and trade-offs in building a diversified graphite supply chain and informs policy and investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Consumption Partial Insurance in the Presence of Tail Income Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure consumption insurance against income shocks accounting for high-order moments of the income distribution. We derive a nonlinear consumption function, where the extent of insurance varies with the shocks' sign and magnitude. Using PSID data, we estimate an asymmetric pass-through of bad versus good permanent shocks - 17% of a 3 sigma negative shock transmits to consumption versus 9% of an equal-sized positive shock - with greater pass-through as shocks worsen. Households would sacrifice over 1/8 of lifetime consumption to eliminate tail income risk. Our results align with survey responses to hypothetical events and suggest that tail risk matters substantially for consumption.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Investors' Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the voluntary disclosure decision of investors under uncertainty about information endowment (Dye 1985). In our model, an investor first uncovers initial evidence about the target firm and then seeks additional information to help interpret the initial evidence. The investor takes a position in the firm's stock, then voluntarily discloses some or all of their findings, and finally closes their position after the disclosure. We present two main findings. First, the investor will always disclose the initial evidence, even though the market is uncertain about whether the investor possesses such evidence. Second, the investor's disclosure strategy of the additional information increases stock price volatility: they disclose extreme news and withhold moderate news.</description>

      <title>Reference Points, Risk-Taking Behavior, and Competitive Outcomes in Sequential Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how competitive pressure affects risk-taking is crucial in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This study examines these effects using bench press competition data, where individuals make risk-based choices under pressure. We estimate the impact of pressure on weight selection and success probability. Pressure from rivals increases attempted weights on average, but responses vary by gender, experience, and rivalry history. Counterfactual simulations show that removing pressure leads many lifters to select lower weights and achieve lower success rates, though some benefit. The results reveal substantial heterogeneity in how competition shapes both risk-taking and performance.</description>

      <title>The economics of global personality diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between personality diversity and national economic performance, introducing the Global Personality Diversity Index (${\Psi}$-GPDI) as a novel metric. Leveraging a dataset of 760,242 individuals across 135 countries, we quantify within-country diversity based on the Big Five personality traits. Our findings reveal that personality diversity accounts for 19.9% of the variance in GDP per capita and provides an additional 2.8% explanatory power beyond institutional quality and immigration, underscoring its unique contribution to economic vitality. Through multi-factor analysis, we demonstrate how personality diversity complements existing economic frameworks, offering actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance innovation, productivity, and resilience. This research positions psychological diversity as a critical yet under explored factor in driving economic growth, bridging the fields of psychology and economics.</description>

      <title>Demand Estimation with Text and Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a demand estimation method that leverages unstructured text and image data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a random coefficients logit model. This approach enables researchers to estimate demand even when they lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes, such as visual design or functional benefits. Using data from a choice experiment, we show that our approach outperforms standard attribute-based models in counterfactual predictions of consumers' second choices. We also apply it across 40 product categories on Amazon and consistently find that text and image data help identify close substitutes within each category.</description>

      <title>The Diffusive Nature of Housing Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the French housing market prices in the period 1970-2022, with high-resolution data from 2018 to 2022. The spatial correlation of the observed price field exhibits logarithmic decay characteristic of the two-dimensional random diffusion equation -- local interactions may create long-range correlations. We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space. Our study confirms and quantifies the diffusive nature of housing prices that was anticipated long ago (Clapp et al. 1994, Pollakowski et al. 1997), albeit on much restricted, local data sets.</description>

      <title>Modeling Story Expectations to Understand Engagement: A Generative Framework Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding when and why consumers engage with stories is crucial for content creators and platforms. While existing theories suggest that audience beliefs of what is going to happen should play an important role in engagement decisions, empirical work has mostly focused on developing techniques to directly extract features from actual content, rather than capturing forward-looking beliefs, due to the lack of a principled way to model such beliefs in unstructured narrative data. To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%. The results reveal that different types of engagement-continuing to read, commenting, and voting-are driven by distinct combinations of current and anticipated content features. Our framework provides a novel way to study and explore how audience forward-looking beliefs shape their engagement with narrative media, with implications for marketing strategy in content-focused industries.</description>
