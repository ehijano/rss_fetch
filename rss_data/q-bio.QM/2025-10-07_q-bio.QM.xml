      <title>InstructPLM-mu: 1-Hour Fine-Tuning of ESM2 Beats ESM3 in Protein Mutation Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.</description>

      <title>Scale dependence in hidden Markov models for animal movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used increasingly to understand how movement patterns of animals arise from behavioural states. An animal is assumed to transition between behavioural states through time, as described by transition probabilities. Within each state, the movement typically follows a discrete-time random walk, where steps between successive observed locations are described in terms of step lengths (related to speed) and turning angles (related to tortuosity). HMMs are discrete-time models, and most of their outputs strongly depend on the temporal resolution of data. We compile known theoretical results about scale dependence in Markov chains and correlated random walks, which are the most common components of HMMs for animal movement. We also illustrate this phenomenon using simulations covering a wide range of biological scenarios. The scale dependence affects not only all model parameters, i.e., the transition probabilities and the movement parameters within each behavioural state, but also the overall classification of movement patterns into states. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the time resolution when drawing conclusions from the results of analysis. In addition, scale dependence generally precludes the analysis of tracking data collected at irregular time intervals, and the comparison (or combination) of data sets with different sampling rates. HMMs remain a valuable tool to answer questions about animal movement and behaviour, as long as these limitations are well understood.</description>

      <title>Inverse statistics of active matter trajectories to distinguish interaction kernel anisotropy from emergent correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging provides dense trajectories of migrating cells, flocking animals, and synthetic active particles, from which interaction laws can be determined with a wide variety of methods. Yet, distinguishing whether front-back or lateral biases seen in such data reflect intrinsic anisotropy in the interaction kernel or emergent correlations that are nevertheless produced by isotropic pairwise interaction forces remains an open challenge. We resolve this ambiguity by deriving a linear partial differential equation that connects measurable two-point velocity correlations to an unknown, distance- and angle-dependent interaction kernel. Turing-like instabilities can occur which allows for dipolar or quadrupolar patterns to arise even when agents interact according to an underlying attraction-repulsion law that is angle-independent. We then show that incorporating a weak velocity-alignment force can interfere with anisotropic pattern formation by suppressing dipolar patterns. We validate these predictions with agent-based simulations and provide design guidance for experiments that seek to discriminate intrinsic anisotropy from emergent effects.</description>

      <title>TCR-EML: Explainable Model Layers for TCR-pMHC Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is a central component of adaptive immunity, with implications for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. While recent advances in machine learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e., with architectural components that can be examined directly after training) have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC binding. Experiments of our proposed method on large-scale datasets demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy and generalization, and evaluation on the TCR-XAI benchmark demonstrates improved explainability compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Impact of Force Field Polarization on Correlated Motions of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated motions of proteins underpin many physiological mechanisms, such as substrate binding, signal transduction, enzymatic activity and allostery. These motions arise from low frequency collective movements of biomolecules and have mostly been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present the effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular dynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m additive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was conducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described dynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain of PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate transcription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been previously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the transmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the results of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of residue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and hydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater and correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with the non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large hydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native contacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the simulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide the first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in computational studies that focus on correlated motions.</description>

      <title>Bridging Clinical Narratives and ACR Appropriateness Guidelines: A Multi-Agent RAG System for Medical Imaging Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of appropriate medical imaging procedures is a critical and complex clinical decision, guided by extensive evidence-based standards such as the ACR Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC). However, the underutilization of these guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient narratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent cognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical scenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations. Our system leverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on a synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation pairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC knowledge base. This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9% top-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for selection and evidence-based synthesis. We evaluate our architecture using GPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match accuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set was identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. This represents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong standalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our architecture makes to a frontier model. These results were obtained on a challenging test set with substantial lexical divergence from the source guidelines.

      <title>Robust multicellular programs dissect the complex tumor microenvironment and track disease progression in colorectal adenocarcinomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival rates dropping from $\sim$90% in localized disease to $\sim$15% with distant metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression, but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522 colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular organization in other solid tumors.</description>

      <title>RawBench: A Comprehensive Benchmarking Framework for Raw Nanopore Signal Analysis Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing technologies continue to advance rapidly, offering critical benefits such as real-time analysis, the ability to sequence extremely long DNA fragments (up to millions of bases in a single read), and the option to selectively stop sequencing a molecule before completion. Traditionally, the raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large neural network models. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge deployment is necessary.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets For mRNA Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution sequences.</description>

      <title>Mapping gene expression dynamics to developmental phenotypes with information entropy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of multicellular organisms entails a deep connection between time-dependent biochemical processes taking place at the subcellular level, and the resulting macroscopic phenotypes that arise in populations of up to trillions of cells. A statistical mechanics of developmental processes would help to understand how microscopic genotypes map onto macroscopic phenotypes, a general goal across biology. Here we follow this approach, hypothesizing that development should be understood as a thermodynamic transition between non-equilibrium states. We test this hypothesis in the context of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used widely in genetics and developmental biology for over a century. Applying a variety of information-theoretic measures to public transcriptomics datasets of whole fly embryos during development, we show that the global temporal dynamics of gene expression can be understood as a process that probabilistically guides embryonic dynamics across macroscopic phenotypic stages. In particular, we demonstrate signatures of irreversibility in the information complexity of transcriptomic dynamics, as measured mainly by the permutation entropy of indexed ensembles (PI entropy). Our results show that the dynamics of PI entropy correlate strongly with developmental stages. Overall, this is a test case in applying information complexity analysis to relate the statistical mechanics of biomarkers to macroscopic developmental dynamics.</description>

      <title>ModernBERT + ColBERT: Enhancing biomedical RAG through an advanced re-ranking retriever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.</description>

      <title>\mu DeepIQA: deep learning-based fast and robust image quality assessment with local predictions for optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.</description>

      <title>Flow-Matching Based Refiner for Molecular Conformer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.</description>

Abstract: Wild animals are commonly fitted with trackers that record their position through time, and statistical models for tracking data broadly fall into two categories: models focused on small-scale movement decisions, and models for large-scale spatial distributions. Due to this dichotomy, it is challenging to describe mathematically how animals' distributions arise from their short-term movement patterns, and to combine data sets collected at different scales. We propose a multiscale model of animal movement and space use based on the underdamped Langevin process, widely used in statistical physics. The model is convenient to describe animal movement for three reasons: it is specified in continuous time (such that its parameters are not dependent on an arbitrary time scale), its speed and direction are autocorrelated (similarly to real animal trajectories), and it has a closed form stationary distribution that we can view as a model of long-term space use. We use the common form of a resource selection function for the stationary distribution, to model the environmental drivers behind the animal's movement decisions. We further increase flexibility by allowing movement parameters to be time-varying, and find conditions under which the stationary distribution is preserved. We derive an explicit mathematical link to step selection functions, commonly used in wildlife studies, providing new theoretical results about their scale-dependence. We formulate the underdamped Langevin model as a state-space model and present a computationally efficient method of inference based on the Kalman filter and a marginal likelihood approach for mixed effect extensions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>
