      <title>Elementary Constituents Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we conjecture and provide evidence that quantum gravity cobordism classes are trivialized by elementary generators with tension at most order 1 in Planck units. Motivated by the attractor mechanism and a number of key examples, we propose that there is always a regime in the field space of the EFT in which the intrinsic tension of such an object is at most Planckian. This work brings together kinematic and dynamical aspects of cobordism defects in the context of the Swampland program.</description>

      <title>Sparse Modular Forms, Lattices, and Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by sparseness conditions for holographic CFTs, we investigate sparseness of modular forms, lattices, and codes. For this we investigate the free energy of such objects as their weight, dimension or size goes to infinity. We construct families of modular forms that are sparse, such as the Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(\tau)$. We then investigate lattices that come from codes and introduce a sparseness condition for such lattices. We investigate the limit of lattices constructed from self-dual Reed-Muller codes and provide evidence that they are sparse in this sense.</description>

      <title>Patch-wise localization with Chern-Simons forms in five dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using equivariant localization for foliations, we compute the on-shell action of a general class of supersymmetric solutions of five-dimensional gauged supergravity with vector multiplets. Unlike previous literature, we also allow for a non-trivial topology for the space-time as well as for the gauge fields. In practice, we achieve this by covering the spacetime manifold with patches and localizing in each patch. We derive a general formula for the on-shell action that depends on topological data only and can be used without a detailed knowledge of the solution. Our final result is relevant for the physically interesting examples of multi-center black holes, black rings and black lenses, topological solitons and Euclidean black saddles. We also show how to connect the topological data with the thermodynamic data: electrostatic potential, the magnetic fluxes and the possible flat connections of the solutions. Our formula for the on-shell action is derived in the context of gauged supergravity, but it is straightforward to take the ungauged limit. Thus, we reproduce known results for a large class of explicit asymptotically flat supersymmetric solutions, and we provide predictions for AdS solutions still to be found.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Gravitational Waveform from Its Probe Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational observables for binary systems exhibit a simple polynomial dependence on the masses $m_1$, $m_2$ of the two scattering objects when they are written in terms of the appropriate kinematic variables in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime. We point out that this property, combined with particle interchange symmetry, allows one to reconstruct the leading and subleading PM waveforms from their probe limit, $m_1 \gg m_2$. As an application, focusing on their re-expansion in the small-velocity or post-Newtonian (PN) regime, we calculate the probe-limit waveforms up to 10PN, and then exploit this observation to deduce from them the waveforms for generic masses in the center-of-mass frame up to 5PN. To this end, we employ both the amplitude-based waveform integrands and the tail formula. This combined approach simplifies substantially the PN expansion of the full subleading PM waveform.</description>

      <title>Subleading Color Corrections at Three Loops to the $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^2)$ Three-Point Form Factor in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute three-loop corrections to the three-point form factor of the operator $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^2)$ in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. In particular, our result is valid beyond the leading-color limit and will consequently be an important input towards extending the amplitude-bootstrap program beyond the leading-color approximation. We find that our analytic formulae are strikingly compact expressions in terms of integer linear combinations of generalized polylogarithms of weight six.</description>

      <title>Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics and the Rayleigh-Jeans Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared quantum electrodynamics (IR-QED) acquires a natural geometric interpretation once soft photons are described as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds. Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</description>

      <title>Vortex stability in pseudo-Hermitian theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian (including $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) field theories support phenomenology that cannot be replicated in standard Hermitian theories. We describe a concrete example in which the vortex solutions that are realised in a prototypical pseudo-Hermitian field theory exhibit a novel metastability, despite the model parameters residing within the naively stable regime of exact antilinear symmetry of the vacuum theory. This instability is identified analytically and confirmed through numerical simulations, and it arises from the small breaking of the underlying antilinear symmetry of the pseudo-Hermitian theory due to the presence of the topological defect. This leads to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion governing fluctuations around the vortex, inducing non-trivial exceptional-point structures and complex frequencies within their spectrum. Aside from offering intriguing possibilities for cosmology, this result serves to illustrate the ability to produce long-lived metastable configurations in pseudo-Hermitian field theories of relevance beyond cosmology and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Model of Black Hole Evaporation with Controlled Causal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a four-qubit quantum circuit model of black hole evaporation that enforces semi-causality, a condition that allows information to enter a black hole but strictly forbids any information from escaping from the interior to outside through the horizon. In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Relation between Commutative and Non-Commutative Descriptions of D-branes in Large R-R Field Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Seiberg-Witten map to first order in the non-commutativity parameter for D-branes in the presence of a large R-R background field. This result enables a systematic investigation of the commutative formulation of the corresponding Lagrangian. In the SU($N$) sector, the map introduces a non-local operator. In contrast, in the U(1) sector, this non-locality can be removed. This contrast suggests that the essential source of non-local behavior lies in the non-Abelian degrees of freedom. The commutative description obtained here offers further insight into both the Dirac-Born-Infeld structure and its possible extensions to the dynamics of M5-branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical and non-deterministic finite automata associated to representations of the braid group. After briefly reviewing basic definitions on finite automata, Coxeter's groups and the associated word problem, we turn to the Artin presentation of the braid group and its quotients. We present various representations of the braid group as deterministic or non-deterministic finite state automata and discuss connections with q-Dicke states, as well as Lusztig and crystal bases. We propose the study of the eigenvalue problem of the $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ invariant spin-chain like ``Hamiltonian'' as a systematic means for constructing canonical bases for irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n).$ This is explicitly proven for the algebra $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_2).$ Special braid representations associated with self-distributive structures are also studied as finite automata. These finite state automata organize clusters of eigenstates of these braid representations.</description>

      <title>Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions - study of their behaviour in low energies and possible signals in the detection of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy gravities with Internal Interactions is based on the following two facts. The first is that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. The second is that both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. Here we would like to start by reviewing the gauge theoretic approach of gravities commenting in particular their diffeomorphism invariance. Then we will review the construction of the Conformal Gravity and the Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravity using the gauge theoretic framework. Finally based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group we will present the Unification of both Gravities with the Internal Interactions. Both unified schemes will be examined further concerning their behaviour in low energies after suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings as well as the possible signals of the related cosmic strings in the gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Realizing Unitary $k$-designs with a Single Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible defects in generalized Ising models via strange correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.</description>

      <title>Extremal isolated horizons of the NUT type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a construction of a new class of axisymmetric extremal isolated horizons admitting a structure of U(1)-principal fiber bundle over a two-sphere. In contrast to the previous examples, the null generators are assumed to be transversal to the bundle fibers. We impose the Einstein equations at the horizon and explicitly derive all intrinsic geometries of the extremal horizon, consisting of a two-sphere metric and a rotation 1-form, in the above class. The 2-geometries turn out to be equivalent to the classification of conically singular horizons with product topology. Both the rotating and non-rotating horizons are then embedded in the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski spacetimes, which naturally admit horizons of this type. Furthermore, we compare our results with previously obtained solutions to the Einstein vacuum extremal horizon equation with cosmological constant and the solution of Petrov type D equation with transversal bundle structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of the Tully-Fisher Relation in Dark Matter Dominated Galaxies: A Theoretical-Empirical Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, in the context of which dark matter is collisional and its equation of state is radius-dependent and has the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)^{\gamma(r)}$. We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K_0\sim M_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.</description>

      <title>Hermitian formulation for mass dimension one fermions: Flat and curved space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout this paper, we conduct our discussion by a partial review of Elko's Hermiticity, introducing the Hermitian formulation for interacting mass dimension one fermions based on Elko spinor. It includes pivotal observations about renormalizability and the study of some allowed interactions. Beyond these points, since dark-matter phenomenology is mainly connected to gravitation, we introduce original remarks on how the Hermitian prescription can be readily generalized to include curved space-time, considering the very definition of the Elko spinor structure. We establish the Elko dual as arising from the path-integral formulation of a more fundamental structure. It enables one to include a curved background space-time and also quantum gravity into our investigations.</description>

      <title>Formulation of fully covariant Quantum-Molecular Dynamics for an N-body system with scalar and vector potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully covariant transport framework for Molecular Dynamics that enables a consistent description of the evolution of relativistic N-body systems. For the first time, we derive relativistic equations of motion incorporating both scalar and vector interactions within a manifestly covariant formulation. This approach addresses several fundamental issues in relativistic many-body dynamics: the implications of different choices of time-constraints, the emergence of the non-relativistic limit, the frame independence of the system's evolution, and the distinct dynamical roles of scalar and vector potentials. These aspects are investigated in detail for the scattering of two- and four-body systems, offering new insights into the consistency and physical interpretation of relativistic interactions in a covariant setting.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of SdS Geodesics and using the Cosmological Horizon to Observe a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagating from near a black hole horizon to the outside world is highly redshifted. In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three.</description>

      <title>Exact, non-singular black holes from a phantom DBI Field as primordial dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.</description>

      <title>A non-local origin for massive gravity and late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{\mu\nu}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu}$, $R^{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{\Lambda CDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Universal regimes of strong turbulence in the multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations in $\gamma$-metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gamma-metric, also known as Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, is a static, axially symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations characterized by two parameters: mass and the deformation parameter gamma. It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics of interacting dark matter-dark energy in generalized Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=\alpha\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+\alpha)$, with $\alpha$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto \rho_m$, $f \propto \rho_{de}$, and $f \propto \rho_m + \rho_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(\Omega_{de}, \Omega_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that, at zero wavenumber, the non-hydrodynamic frequencies of uncharged kinetic theory are purely imaginary. On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Amp\`{e}re-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/\alpha$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2\pi)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/\alpha_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/\alpha_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</description>

      <title>Closing in on $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $\alpha$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $\alpha$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w&gt;1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $\alpha$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $\alpha\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincar\'e models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.</description>

      <title>Uncharted Logarithmic Structures in QCD Transverse-Energy Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD transverse-energy ($E_T$) flow distribution within an azimuthal region of phase space, defined by an angular interval $\Delta \phi$ on the plane transverse to a chosen jet axis. Vetoes on the resulting $E_T$ are widely employed at the LHC to isolate missing transverse momentum in final states with invisible particles. We show that this observable has logarithmic structures never seen before in QCD calculations. Notably, its description involves the resummation of non-global and coherence-violating logarithmic contributions that are more singular than any reported to date. We analyze its all-orders behavior, providing analytical resummations at next-to-double-logarithmic accuracy for $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, and numerical resummations at leading-logarithmic accuracy in the Veneziano limit for $pp$ collisions. We further present a computation of the leading coherence-violating correction for $pp$ collisions. The intricate structure of vetoes in azimuthal gaps reveals new aspects of QCD dynamics and offers a novel probe of collinear-factorization breaking at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Conformal dispersion relation for mixed correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersion relations are nonperturbative formulas that relate the ultraviolet and infrared behavior of an observable with wide-ranging applications applications in linear response theory, quantum field theory scattering amplitudes, and conformal correlators. We derive a position-space dispersion relation for scalar four-point mixed correlation functions in an arbitrary conformal field theory. This formula expresses the correlator in terms of its integrated double discontinuity times a kinematic kernel. The kernel is analytically computed, and expressed in a remarkably simple form as a two-variable Appell function. The dispersion kernel is found by solving a coupled partial differential equation that the kernel obeys. Numerical checks of the dispersion relation are successfully performed for generalized free field correlators. Finally, we show that our position-space dispersion relation is equivalent to a Cauchy-type dispersion relation of the Mellin amplitude of the correlator.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</description>

Abstract: We study one-point functions of non-BPS single-trace operators on the Coulomb branch of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Holography relates them to overlaps between on-shell closed string states and a boundary state describing a probe D3-brane in $AdS_5\times S^{5}$. Assuming that the D-brane preserves integrability, we formulate and solve integrable bootstrap equations satisfied by the boundary state at finite 't Hooft coupling. This leads to a closed-form determinant expression for one-point functions at finite coupling, valid for sufficiently long operators. We test the result against direct field theory computations at tree level and one loop, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess exact structures that resemble integrability, with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such structures live in the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and are based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes, have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite-dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle S^1 to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD, they are color singlets and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>New Exceptional EFTs in de Sitter Space from Generalised Energy Conservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a surprising relationship between exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in de Sitter space and a notion of \textit{generalised energy conservation} (GEC) of an S-matrix defined in an extended Poincar\'{e} patch of four-dimensional de Sitter. By demanding that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal, we constrain the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars living in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations. We rediscover the theories of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon, and when increasing the conformal dimension we find evidence for new exceptional theories where the four-point scalar self interactions are uniquely fixed in terms of a single coupling constant. We conjecture that for each integer conformal dimension $\Delta \geq 4$, there is at least one exceptional EFT that can be entirely fixed by GEC.</description>

      <title>Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson universality classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications for the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the symplectic Wigner-Dyson class, not studied in the literature yet, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this version of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. We further argue for quantum chaoticity in the general $\upbeta$ case, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non-Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known fully analytically we give a novel way to approach it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and compare the results to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reformulate the abelian tensor multiplet on a curved spacetime with at least two supercharges in a cohomological form where all the bosonic and fermionic fields become tensor fields. These tensor fields are rewritten as fields in loop space by a transgression map. There are two lightlike conformal Killing vectors. By decomposing the spacetime tensor fields in transverse and parallel components to these Killing vectors, we obtain the equations of motion in loop space by closing the supersymmetry variations on-shell. We generalize to nonabelian gauge groups. By closing supersymmetry variations we obtain nonabelian fermionic equations of motion in loop space.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify a novel topological subclass, dubbed $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$, in the thermodynamics of higher odd-dimensional, multiply rotating Kerr-AdS black holes. This discovery extends the established topological classification beyond the five classes and two subclasses previously known. The $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass exhibits a unique and previously unreported stability profile: it admits a thermodynamically stable small black hole state in the low-temperature limit, while in the high-temperature limit, the phase space simultaneously contains one stable large black hole, one stable small black hole, and one unstable small black hole state. Our analysis, which treats black hole solutions as topological defects, reveals a richer landscape of black hole thermodynamics than previously understood and necessitates an expansion of the topological classification scheme to accommodate this new phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and entanglement properties of dynamical black holes based on the recently proposed dynamical black hole entropy by Hollands-Wald-Zhang. We first provide a direct proof that, under first order perturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the Wald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute the gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon and the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the apparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole entropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret the generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as the matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows us to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy evaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Testing the Heterotic String with the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of an axion-like particle above the QCD line would rule out Grand Unified Theories, including the perturbative heterotic string with the Standard Model embedded in a single $E_8$ factor or $SO(32)$. In this work we study a possible loophole to this observation, given by compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string with a non-standard embedding of the Standard Model into the 10-dimensional gauge group. If electromagnetism is embedded into both $E_8$ factors, axions can couple to photons via the anomaly without coupling to QCD. We obtain upper bounds to the coupling-to-mass ratio $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ for these axion-like particles as a function of the supersymmetry breaking scale and the unified gauge coupling. To be compatible with the measured gauge couplings and the weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta_w$ at low-energies, phenomenologically viable models with non-standard $U(1)_Y$ embedding require sizeable one-loop threshold corrections from string states and/or charged matter at intermediate energy scales. We study how these effects modify the tree-level upper bounds to $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ and show that, in the perturbative regime, they reduce the leading order estimates. Axion-like particles far above the QCD line are only possible in certain models where perturbation theory is lost. The main conclusion is that the discovery of an axion violating the bounds found in this work would be incompatible with large classes of otherwise phenomenologically viable string models, including the perturbative heterotic $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ string, the type-I string, and certain heterotic M-theories. The role of small gauge instantons and worldsheet instantons in making some of the axion-like particles heavy and cosmologically relevant is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Shadow Ringing of Black Holes from Photon Sphere Quasinormal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent convergence of gravitational-wave (GW) observations and black hole imaging provides complementary probes of strong-gravity dynamics. While the black hole shadow is typically modeled as a static feature, a dynamically perturbed spacetime in its ringdown phase must induce temporal modulations in the shadow's apparent size and shape. We develop a theoretical framework within linear perturbation theory to investigate this shadow ringing effect for a Schwarzschild black hole. By modeling the geometry as a small, mode-selected quasinormal mode (QNM) perturbation, we treat the shadow boundary as an instantaneous separatrix of null geodesics. We derive a first-order, gauge-invariant mapping between the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ and the displacement of the shadow boundary, $\delta R(\varphi,t)$. By perturbing the effective potential for null geodesics near the unstable photon sphere ($r=3M$), we derive mode-resolved transfer coefficients that quantify how the QNM imprints itself onto the shadow. We predict that the shadow boundary oscillates coherently at the QNM's real frequency $\omega_{\rm Re}$ with an exponential damping rate set by $|\omega_{\rm Im}|$. Furthermore, the azimuthal structure of the modulation encodes the spherical harmonic content $(\ell,m)$ of the driving QNM, providing a novel, geometric signature for QNM spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: The Liouville theorem states that classical time evolution is an incompressible flow in phase space. We investigate two formulations of classical mechanics in which this property is manifested. First, the traditional Hamilton-Jacobi theory provides an in-out formalism. Second, a recent idea employing an exponential representation of time evolution provides an in-in formalism. Through concrete examples, it is demonstrated that the on-shell action in the former and the exponential generator in the latter are disparate objects. Still, a concrete relation between the two is identified in terms of a matching calculation. A strictly classical derivation and formulation of classical scattering theory is provided.</description>

      <title>IR/UV mixing from higher-order interactions in a Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the calculated cosmological constant, when regularized with a cutoff, differs hugely from the measured value. These calculations are made on the basis of a wave-vector cut-off that is usually set at the Planck scale. Further, Weinberg's no-go theorem indicates that in the presence of translational invariance, local quantum field theories cannot produce a zero cosmological constant without fine-tuning. Various non-local theories have been constructed, starting from modifications to Einstein's equations, in order to `cancel' away the cosmological constant term. There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantization of General Relativity \`a la Ricci-Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We follow a new pathway to the definition of the Stochastic Quantization (SQ), first proposed by Parisi and Wu, of the action functional yielding the Einstein equations. Hinging on the functional similarities between the Ricci-Flow equation and the SQ Langevin equations proposed by Rumpf, we push forward a novel approach characterized by a multiplicative noise and a stochastic time that converges to the proper time of a space-like foliation in the equilibrium limit, where quantities have constant averages. We express the starting system of equations using the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) variables and their conjugated Hamiltonian momenta. Such a choice is instrumental in understanding the newly derived equations in terms of the breakdown of the diffeomorphism invariance of the classical theory, which instead will hold on average at the steady state. We comment on the physical interpretation of the Ricci flow equations, and argue how they can naturally provide, in a geometrical way, the renormalization group equation for gravity theories. In the general setting, the equation associated to the shift vector yields the Navier-Stokes equation with a stochastic source. Moreover, we show that the fluctuations of the metric tensor components around the equilibrium configurations, far away from the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole, are forced by the Ricci flow to follow the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, whose probabilistic distribution can yield an intermittent statistics. We finally comment on the possible applications of this novel scenario to the cosmological constant, arguing that the Ricci flow may provide a solution to the Hubble tension, as a macroscopic effect of scale dependence of the quantum fluctuations of the metric tensor.</description>

Abstract: In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for representing the state of interest. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed a structural optimization algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in \cite{aly2024nonlinearities} on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how a machine based on deep learning algorithms learns Krylov spread complexity in quantum systems with N x N random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using thermofield double states as initial conditions, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network-based algorithm successfully learns the Krylov spread complexity across all timescales, including the late-time plateaus where states appear nearly featureless and random. Performance strongly depends on the basis choice, performing well with the energy eigenbasis or the Krylov basis but failing in the original basis of the random Hamiltonian. The algorithm also effectively distinguishes temperature-dependent features of thermofield double states. Furthermore, we show that the system time variable of state predicted by deep learning is an irrelevant quantity, reinforcing that the Krylov spread complexity well captures the essential features of the quantum state, even at late times.</description>

      <title>Threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not necessarily asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter, $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for sufficiently large $\kappa$ for the profiles we have used, contrary to expectations. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <title>Global Gauge Symmetry Breaking in the Abelian Higgs Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to resolve the incompatibility between two extant gauge-invariant accounts of the Abelian Higgs mechanism: the first account uses global gauge symmetry breaking, and the second eliminates spontaneous symmetry breaking entirely. We resolve this incompatibility by using the constrained Hamiltonian formalism in symplectic geometry. First we argue that, unlike their local counterparts, global gauge symmetries are physical in the presence of boundary conditions. The symmetry that is spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism is this global one. Second, we explain how the Coulomb gauge is the preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs mechanism. Based on the existence of the physical global gauge symmetry, we resolve the incompatibility between the two accounts by arguing that the correct way to carry out the second method is to eliminate only the redundant gauge symmetries, i.e. those local gauge symmetries which are not global. We extend our analysis to quantum field theory, where we show that the Abelian Higgs mechanism can be understood as spontaneous global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking in the $C^*$-algebraic sense.</description>

On the real component corresponding to the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces $ \mathcal{M}_g$, the generating function corresponding to the symplectomorphism between these new coordinates and Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates is explicitly computed.</description>

      <title>The quantum criticality of the Standard Model and the hierarchy problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The naturalness principle has long guided efforts to understand physics beyond the Standard Model, with the hierarchy problem as the central issue. We revisit the role of quantum corrections in the fine-tuning of the low-energy effective description and its phase structure. We implement, for the first time in this context, the full Standard Model within the Wilsonian functional renormalization group. Crucially, this method captures conveniently both logarithmic and quadratic scalings, which must both be considered in the tuning, and allows us to provide a new generic and quantitative study of fine-tuning and its interpretation in terms of critical phenomena. We emphasize on the connection between the hierarchy problem and the near-criticality of the Standard Model and extract scheme-independent information on the infrared Higgs phases and the associated quantum phase transition as well as discuss a related enhanced fine-tuning usually not considered in tuning estimates. Finally, we illustrate the framework's versatility by exploring new physics coupled to the Higgs sector that can soften high-scale sensitivity, recovering also the large-anomalous-dimension solution to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism for generating anisotropic enhancements of the curvature perturbation through a vector field is proposed. We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes. This suggests that statistical anisotropy in primordial black hole (PBH) formation may be inevitable if inflation undergoes an anisotropic inflationary phase. Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormhole Solutions in massive $F(T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole geometries in the framework of $F(T)$ gravity supplemented by a weak de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive term. Using the static and spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne metric, we derive the field and conservation equations, separating the effective energy-momentum tensor into torsional and massive contributions. We analyze three representative classes of metric redshift functions, namely constant, logarithmic, and power-law forms, and two cases of the massive term, i.e. the general one and the uniform pressure case. The obtained solutions satisfy the flaring-out condition and remain asymptotically flat, while the effective matter sector can fulfill or only mildly violate the standard energy conditions. The results show that the inclusion of a small graviton mass provides an additional anisotropic pressure that can sustain the throat geometry without introducing exotic sources. In the limit of vanishing graviton mass, the configurations continuously reduce to the standard $F(T)$ wormhole solutions, confirming the consistency of the framework.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We disprove the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture, and thus demonstrate that the semi-classical properties of coupled gravitational and electromagnetic fields are more subtle than expected from Lorentzian general relativity, where the Kerr-Newman family of metrics yields the most general stationary and asymptotically flat black holes with a single event horizon. This is achieved by an explicit construction of a new three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. In the case of vanishing charge, these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.</description>

      <title>Acceleration radiation from vibrating atoms in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Dolan \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{New J. Phys. 22, 033026 (2020)}], we study the acceleration radiation from a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector that undergoes small-amplitude radial oscillations at fixed mean radius $R_0$ outside a Schwarzschild black hole. The massless scalar field is quantized in the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged transition rate (or the Floquet transition rate). The resulting particle emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\Omega &gt; \omega_0$ and a closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\overline{P}_n$, which reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\to\infty$, in agreement with Near the horizon, $f(R_0)&lt;1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by $1/\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the spectrum weighted by the Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole horizon as $R_{0}\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known pathological behavior of the Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody factors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically tractable link between flat-space vibrating atom proposals and black-hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>On the Validity of the Background Subtraction Method for Black Hole Thermodynamics in Matter-Coupled Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer--Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer--Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.</description>

      <title>Emergent spectral geometry in the Coherence--Curvature Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Coherence--Curvature Model (CCM), a dynamical ensemble of connected graphs governed by a Hamiltonian that couples algebraic connectivity, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, and an edge-density penalty. Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds &gt; dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries.</description>
