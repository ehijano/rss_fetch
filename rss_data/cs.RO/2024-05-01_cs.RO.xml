      <title>Maritime Vessel Tank Inspection using Aerial Robots: Experience from the field and dataset release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents field results and lessons learned from the deployment of aerial robots inside ship ballast tanks. Vessel tanks including ballast tanks and cargo holds present dark, dusty environments having simultaneously very narrow openings and wide open spaces that create several challenges for autonomous navigation and inspection operations. We present a system for vessel tank inspection using an aerial robot along with its autonomy modules. We show the results of autonomous exploration and visual inspection in 3 ships spanning across 7 distinct types of sections of the ballast tanks. Additionally, we comment on the lessons learned from the field and possible directions for future work. Finally, we release a dataset consisting of the data from these missions along with data collected with a handheld sensor stick.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Driven Cooperative Ball Balance in Rigidly Coupled Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-drone cooperative transport (CT) problem has been widely studied in the literature. However, limited work exists on control of such systems in the presence of time-varying uncertainties, such as the time-varying center of gravity (CG). This paper presents a leader-follower approach for the control of a multi-drone CT system with time-varying CG. The leader uses a traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, and in contrast, the follower uses a deep reinforcement learning (RL) controller using only local information and minimal leader information. Extensive simulation results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method over a previously developed adaptive controller and for variations in the mass of the objects being transported and CG speeds. Preliminary experimental work also demonstrates ball balance (depicting moving CG) on a stick/rod lifted by two Crazyflie drones cooperatively.</description>

      <title>Replicating Human Anatomy with Vision Controlled Jetting -- A Pneumatic Musculoskeletal Hand and Forearm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional replication and actuation of complex structures inspired by nature is a longstanding goal for humanity. Creating such complex structures combining soft and rigid features and actuating them with artificial muscles would further our understanding of natural kinematic structures. We printed a biomimetic hand in a single print process comprised of a rigid skeleton, soft joint capsules, tendons, and printed touch sensors. We showed it's actuation using electric motors. In this work, we expand on this work by adding a forearm that is also closely modeled after the human anatomy and replacing the hand's motors with 22 independently controlled pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). Our thin, high-strain (up to 30.1%) PAMs match the performance of state-of-the-art artificial muscles at a lower cost. The system showcases human-like dexterity with independent finger movements, demonstrating successful grasping of various objects, ranging from a small, lightweight coin to a large can of 272g in weight. The performance evaluation, based on fingertip and grasping forces along with finger joint range of motion, highlights the system's potential.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Longitudinal Control and Collision Avoidance in High-Risk Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems primarily focus on the vehicle directly ahead, often overlooking potential risks from following vehicles. This oversight can lead to ineffective handling of high risk situations, such as high speed, closely spaced, multi vehicle scenarios where emergency braking by one vehicle might trigger a pile up collision. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning based algorithm for longitudinal control and collision avoidance. This proposed algorithm effectively considers the behavior of both leading and following vehicles. Its implementation in simulated high risk scenarios, which involve emergency braking in dense traffic where traditional systems typically fail, has demonstrated the algorithm ability to prevent potential pile up collisions, including those involving heavy duty vehicles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Encapsulation With Guaranteed Convergence Using Minimalist Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a decentralized control algorithm for a minimalist robotic swarm lacking memory, explicit communication, or relative position information, to encapsulate multiple diffusive target sources in a bounded environment. The state-of-the-art approaches generally require either local communication or relative localization to provide guarantees of convergence and safety. We quantify trade-offs between task, control, and robot parameters for guaranteed safe convergence to all the sources. Furthermore, our algorithm is robust to occlusions and noise in the sensor measurements as we demonstrate in simulation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reward Design and Evaluation for Robust Humanoid Standing and Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A necessary capability for humanoid robots is the ability to stand and walk while rejecting natural disturbances. Recent progress has been made using sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) to train such locomotion controllers, with approaches differing mainly in their reward functions. However, prior works lack a clear method to systematically test new reward functions and compare controller performance through repeatable experiments. This limits our understanding of the trade-offs between approaches and hinders progress. To address this, we propose a low-cost, quantitative benchmarking method to evaluate and compare the real-world performance of standing and walking (SaW) controllers on metrics like command following, disturbance recovery, and energy efficiency. We also revisit reward function design and construct a minimally constraining reward function to train SaW controllers. We experimentally verify that our benchmarking framework can identify areas for improvement, which can be systematically addressed to enhance the policies. We also compare our new controller to state-of-the-art controllers on the Digit humanoid robot. The results provide clear quantitative trade-offs among the controllers and suggest directions for future improvements to the reward functions and expansion of the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FOTS: A Fast Optical Tactile Simulator for Sim2Real Learning of Tactile-motor Robot Manipulation Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation is a widely used tool in robotics to reduce hardware consumption and gather large-scale data. Despite previous efforts to simulate optical tactile sensors, there remain challenges in efficiently synthesizing images and replicating marker motion under different contact loads. In this work, we propose a fast optical tactile simulator, named FOTS, for simulating optical tactile sensors. We utilize multi-layer perceptron mapping and planar shadow generation to simulate the optical response, while employing marker distribution approximation to simulate the motion of surface markers caused by the elastomer deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that FOTS outperforms other methods in terms of image generation quality and rendering speed, achieving 28.6 fps for optical simulation and 326.1 fps for marker motion simulation on a single CPU without GPU acceleration. In addition, we integrate the FOTS simulation model with physical engines like MuJoCo, and the peg-in-hole task demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving zero-shot Sim2Real learning of tactile-motor robot manipulation skills. Our code is available at https://github.com/Rancho-zhao/FOTS.</description>

      <title>Learning to Communicate Functional States with Nonverbal Expressions for Improved Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative robots must effectively communicate their internal state to humans to enable a smooth interaction. Nonverbal communication is widely used to communicate information during human-robot interaction, however, such methods may also be misunderstood, leading to communication errors. In this work, we explore modulating the acoustic parameter values (pitch bend, beats per minute, beats per loop) of nonverbal auditory expressions to convey functional robot states (accomplished, progressing, stuck). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on noisy human feedback to produce accurately interpreted nonverbal auditory expressions. The proposed approach was evaluated through a user study with 24 participants. The results demonstrate that: 1. Our proposed RL-based approach is able to learn suitable acoustic parameter values which improve the users' ability to correctly identify the state of the robot. 2. Algorithm initialization informed by previous user data can be used to significantly speed up the learning process. 3. The method used for algorithm initialization strongly influences whether participants converge to similar sounds for each robot state. 4. Modulation of pitch bend has the largest influence on user association between sounds and robotic states.</description>

      <title>DiffuseLoco: Real-Time Legged Locomotion Control with Diffusion from Offline Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces DiffuseLoco, a framework for training multi-skill diffusion-based policies for dynamic legged locomotion from offline datasets, enabling real-time control of diverse skills on robots in the real world. Offline learning at scale has led to breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic manipulation domains. However, scaling up learning for legged robot locomotion, especially with multiple skills in a single policy, presents significant challenges for prior online reinforcement learning methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, scalable framework that leverages diffusion models to directly learn from offline multimodal datasets with a diverse set of locomotion skills. With design choices tailored for real-time control in dynamical systems, including receding horizon control and delayed inputs, DiffuseLoco is capable of reproducing multimodality in performing various locomotion skills, zero-shot transfer to real quadrupedal robots, and it can be deployed on edge computing devices. Furthermore, DiffuseLoco demonstrates free transitions between skills and robustness against environmental variations. Through extensive benchmarking in real-world experiments, DiffuseLoco exhibits better stability and velocity tracking performance compared to prior reinforcement learning and non-diffusion-based behavior cloning baselines. The design choices are validated via comprehensive ablation studies. This work opens new possibilities for scaling up learning-based legged locomotion controllers through the scaling of large, expressive models and diverse offline datasets.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Traffic Light State Detection for Urban Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multimodal traffic light state detection using vision and sound, from the viewpoint of a quadruped robot navigating in urban settings. This is a challenging problem because of the visual occlusions and noise from robot locomotion. Our method combines features from raw audio with the ratios of red and green pixels within bounding boxes, identified by established vision-based detectors. The fusion method aggregates features across multiple frames in a given timeframe, increasing robustness and adaptability. Results show that our approach effectively addresses the challenge of visual occlusion and surpasses the performance of single-modality solutions when the robot is in motion. This study serves as a proof of concept, highlighting the significant, yet often overlooked, potential of multi-modal perception in robotics.</description>

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated its transformative potential, its adoption for real-world manufacturing applications remains limited. We present an Explanation User Interface (XUI) for a state-of-the-art deep learning-based robot program optimizer which provides both naive and expert users with different user experiences depending on their skill level, as well as Explainable AI (XAI) features to facilitate the application of deep learning methods in real-world applications. To evaluate the impact of the XUI on task performance, user satisfaction and cognitive load, we present the results of a preliminary user survey and propose a study design for a large-scale follow-up study.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Enhanced Motion Planner: Attention-Guided Sampling for State-Specific Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithms are renowned for their robust global search capabilities. However, the inherent randomness in their sampling mechanisms often result in inconsistent path quality and limited search efficiency. In response to these challenges, this work proposes a novel deep learning-based motion planning framework, named Transformer-Enhanced Motion Planner (TEMP), which synergizes an Environmental Information Semantic Encoder (EISE) with a Motion Planning Transformer (MPT). EISE converts environmental data into semantic environmental information (SEI), providing MPT with an enriched environmental comprehension. MPT leverages an attention mechanism to dynamically recalibrate its focus on SEI, task objectives, and historical planning data, refining the sampling node generation. To demonstrate the capabilities of TEMP, we train our model using a dataset comprised of planning results produced by the RRT*. EISE and MPT are collaboratively trained, enabling EISE to autonomously learn and extract patterns from environmental data, thereby forming semantic representations that MPT could more effectively interpret and utilize for motion planning. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic evaluation of TEMP's efficacy across diverse task dimensions, which demonstrates that TEMP achieves exceptional performance metrics and a heightened degree of generalizability compared to state-of-the-art SBMPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for enhancing robotic adaptability and learning efficiency, which integrates unsupervised trajectory segmentation with adaptive probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs). By employing a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that combines autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our approach autonomously pinpoints critical transitional points in continuous, unlabeled motion data, thus significantly reducing dependence on extensively labeled datasets. This innovative method dynamically adjusts motion trajectories using conditional variables, significantly enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of robotic actions under dynamic conditions while also reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional robotic programming methods. Our experimental validation demonstrates superior learning efficiency and adaptability compared to existing techniques, paving the way for advanced applications in industrial and service robotics.</description>

      <title>Sensorized Soft Skin for Dexterous Robotic Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional industrial robots often use two-fingered grippers or suction cups to manipulate objects or interact with the world. Because of their simplified design, they are unable to reproduce the dexterity of human hands when manipulating a wide range of objects. While the control of humanoid hands evolved greatly, hardware platforms still lack capabilities, particularly in tactile sensing and providing soft contact surfaces. In this work, we present a method that equips the skeleton of a tendon-driven humanoid hand with a soft and sensorized tactile skin. Multi-material 3D printing allows us to iteratively approach a cast skin design which preserves the robot's dexterity in terms of range of motion and speed. We demonstrate that a soft skin enables firmer grasps and piezoresistive sensor integration enhances the hand's tactile sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Time, Travel, and Energy in the Uniform Dispersion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the algorithmic problem of uniformly dispersing a swarm of robots in an unknown, gridlike environment. In this setting, our goal is to comprehensively study the relationships between performance metrics and robot capabilities. We introduce a formal model comparing dispersion algorithms based on makespan, traveled distance, energy consumption, sensing, communication, and memory. Using this framework, we classify several uniform dispersion algorithms according to their capability requirements and performance. We prove that while makespan and travel can be minimized in all environments, energy cannot, as long as the swarm's sensing range is bounded. In contrast, we show that energy can be minimized even by simple, ``ant-like" robots in synchronous settings and asymptotically minimized in asynchronous settings, provided the environment is topologically simply connected. Our findings offer insights into fundamental limitations that arise when designing swarm robotics systems for exploring unknown environments, highlighting the impact of environment's topology on the feasibility of energy-efficient dispersion.</description>

      <title>Integrating Visuo-tactile Sensing with Haptic Feedback for Teleoperated Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telerobotics enables humans to overcome spatial constraints and allows them to physically interact with the environment in remote locations. However, the sensory feedback provided by the system to the operator is often purely visual, limiting the operator's dexterity in manipulation tasks. In this work, we address this issue by equipping the robot's end-effector with high-resolution visuotactile GelSight sensors. Using low-cost MANUS-Gloves, we provide the operator with haptic feedback about forces acting at the points of contact in the form of vibration signals. We propose two different methods for estimating these forces; one based on estimating the movement of markers on the sensor surface and one deep-learning approach. Additionally, we integrate our system into a virtual-reality teleoperation pipeline in which a human operator controls both arms of a Tiago robot while receiving visual and haptic feedback. We believe that integrating haptic feedback is a crucial step for dexterous manipulation in teleoperated robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Reactive Temporal Logic-based Planning and Control for Interactive Robotic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots interacting with humans must be safe, reactive and adapt online to unforeseen environmental and task changes. Achieving these requirements concurrently is a challenge as interactive planners lack formal safety guarantees, while safe motion planners lack flexibility to adapt. To tackle this, we propose a modular control architecture that generates both safe and reactive motion plans for human-robot interaction by integrating temporal logic-based discrete task level plans with continuous Dynamical System (DS)-based motion plans. We formulate a reactive temporal logic formula that enables users to define task specifications through structured language, and propose a planning algorithm at the task level that generates a sequence of desired robot behaviors while being adaptive to environmental changes. At the motion level, we incorporate control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions to compute stable and safe continuous motion plans for two types of robot behaviors: (i) complex, possibly periodic motions given by autonomous DS and (ii) time-critical tasks specified by Signal Temporal Logic~(STL). Our methodology is demonstrated on the Franka robot arm performing wiping tasks on a whiteboard and a mannequin that is compliant to human interactions and adaptive to environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey presents an overview of methods for learning from video (LfV) in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. We focus on methods capable of scaling to large internet video datasets and, in the process, extracting foundational knowledge about the world's dynamics and physical human behaviour. Such methods hold great promise for developing general-purpose robots.
  We open with an overview of fundamental concepts relevant to the LfV-for-robotics setting. This includes a discussion of the exciting benefits LfV methods can offer (e.g., improved generalization beyond the available robot data) and commentary on key LfV challenges (e.g., challenges related to missing information in video and LfV distribution shifts). Our literature review begins with an analysis of video foundation model techniques that can extract knowledge from large, heterogeneous video datasets. Next, we review methods that specifically leverage video data for robot learning. Here, we categorise work according to which RL knowledge modality benefits from the use of video data. We additionally highlight techniques for mitigating LfV challenges, including reviewing action representations that address the issue of missing action labels in video.
  Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</description>

      <title>Impact of whole-body vibrations on electrovibration perception varies with target stimulus duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of whole-body vibrations induced by external vehicle perturbations, such as aircraft turbulence, on the perception of electrovibration displayed on touchscreens. Electrovibration holds promise as a technology for providing tactile feedback on future touchscreens, addressing usability challenges in vehicle cockpits. However, its performance under dynamic conditions, such as during whole-body vibrations induced by turbulence, still needs to be explored. We measured the absolute detection thresholds of 15 human participants for short- and long-duration electrovibration stimuli displayed on a touchscreen, both in the absence and presence of two types of turbulence motion generated by a motion simulator. Concurrently, we measured participants' applied contact force and finger scan speeds. Significantly higher (38%) absolute detection thresholds were observed for short electrovibration stimuli than for long stimuli. Finger scan speeds in the direction of turbulence, applied forces, and force fluctuation rates increased during whole-body vibrations due to biodynamic feedthrough. As a result, turbulence also significantly increased the perception thresholds, but only for short-duration electrovibration stimuli. The results reveal that whole-body vibrations can impede the perception of short-duration electrovibration stimuli, due to involuntary finger movements and increased normal force fluctuations. Our findings offer valuable insights for the future design of touchscreens with tactile feedback in vehicle cockpits.</description>

      <title>Global Search Optics: Automatically Exploring Optimal Solutions to Compact Computational Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of mobile vision creates a demand for advanced compact computational imaging systems, which call for the development of both a lightweight optical system and an effective image reconstruction model. Recently, joint design pipelines come to the research forefront, where the two significant components are simultaneously optimized via data-driven learning to realize the optimal system design. However, the effectiveness of these designs largely depends on the initial setup of the optical system, complicated by a non-convex solution space that impedes reaching a globally optimal solution. In this work, we present Global Search Optics (GSO) to automatically design compact computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution. Extensive experimental results on the design of three-piece (3P) sphere computational imaging systems illustrate that the GSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global optimal structure searching ability, which provides compact computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to traditional methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/wumengshenyou/GSO.</description>

      <title>SemanticFormer: Holistic and Semantic Traffic Scene Representation for Trajectory Prediction using Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction in autonomous driving relies on accurate representation of all relevant contexts of the driving scene including traffic participants, road topology, traffic signs as well as their semantic relations to each other. Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MGCBS: An Optimal and Efficient Algorithm for Solving Multi-Goal Multi-Agent Path Finding Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the expansion of the scale of robotics applications, the multi-goal multi-agent pathfinding (MG-MAPF) problem began to gain widespread attention. This problem requires each agent to visit pre-assigned multiple goal points at least once without conflict. Some previous methods have been proposed to solve the MG-MAPF problem based on Decoupling the goal Vertex visiting order search and the Single-agent pathfinding (DVS). However, this paper demonstrates that the methods based on DVS cannot always obtain the optimal solution. To obtain the optimal result, we propose the Multi-Goal Conflict-Based Search (MGCBS), which is based on Decoupling the goal Safe interval visiting order search and the Single-agent pathfinding (DSS). Additionally, we present the Time-Interval-Space Forest (TIS Forest) to enhance the efficiency of MGCBS by maintaining the shortest paths from any start point at any start time step to each safe interval at the goal points. The experiment demonstrates that our method can consistently obtain optimal results and execute up to 7 times faster than the state-of-the-art method in our evaluation.</description>

      <title>Risk-aware Meta-level Decision Making for Exploration Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic exploration of unknown environments is fundamentally a problem of decision making under uncertainty where the robot must account for uncertainty in sensor measurements, localization, action execution, as well as many other factors. For large-scale exploration applications, autonomous systems must overcome the challenges of sequentially deciding which areas of the environment are valuable to explore while safely evaluating the risks associated with obstacles and hazardous terrain. In this work, we propose a risk-aware meta-level decision making framework to balance the tradeoffs associated with local and global exploration. Meta-level decision making builds upon classical hierarchical coverage planners by switching between local and global policies with the overall objective of selecting the policy that is most likely to maximize reward in a stochastic environment. We use information about the environment history, traversability risk, and kinodynamic constraints to reason about the probability of successful policy execution to switch between local and global policies. We have validated our solution in both simulation and on a variety of large-scale real world hardware tests. Our results show that by balancing local and global exploration we are able to significantly explore large-scale environments more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-real transfer of active suspension control using deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore sim-to-real transfer of deep reinforcement learning controllers for a heavy vehicle with active suspensions designed for traversing rough terrain. While related research primarily focuses on lightweight robots with electric motors and fast actuation, this study uses a forestry vehicle with a complex hydraulic driveline and slow actuation. We simulate the vehicle using multibody dynamics and apply system identification to find an appropriate set of simulation parameters. We then train policies in simulation using various techniques to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, including domain randomization, action delays, and a reward penalty to encourage smooth control. In reality, the policies trained with action delays and a penalty for erratic actions perform nearly at the same level as in simulation. In experiments on level ground, the motion trajectories closely overlap when turning to either side, as well as in a route tracking scenario. When faced with a ramp that requires active use of the suspensions, the simulated and real motions are in close alignment. This shows that the actuator model together with system identification yields a sufficiently accurate model of the actuators. We observe that policies trained without the additional action penalty exhibit fast switching or bang-bang control. These present smooth motions and high performance in simulation but transfer poorly to reality. We find that policies make marginal use of the local height map for perception, showing no indications of predictive planning. However, the strong transfer capabilities entail that further development concerning perception and performance can be largely confined to simulation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Intelligence and Instinct: A New Control Paradigm for Autonomous Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) progresses at a breathtaking pace, the application of large language models (LLMs) as AI Agents in robotics remains in its nascent stage. A significant concern that hampers the seamless integration of these AI Agents into robotics is the unpredictability of the content they generate, a phenomena known as ``hallucination''. Drawing inspiration from biological neural systems, we propose a novel, layered architecture for autonomous robotics, bridging AI agent intelligence and robot instinct. In this context, we define Robot Instinct as the innate or learned set of responses and priorities in an autonomous robotic system that ensures survival-essential tasks, such as safety assurance and obstacle avoidance, are carried out in a timely and effective manner. This paradigm harmoniously combines the intelligence of LLMs with the instinct of robotic behaviors, contributing to a more safe and versatile autonomous robotic system. As a case study, we illustrate this paradigm within the context of a mobile robot, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance autonomous robotics and enabling a future where robots can operate independently and safely across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Change of Scenery: Unsupervised LiDAR Change Detection for Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised deep change detection approach for mobile robots with 3D LiDAR. In unstructured environments, it is infeasible to define a closed set of semantic classes. Instead, semantic segmentation is reformulated as binary change detection. We develop a neural network, RangeNetCD, that uses an existing point-cloud map and a live LiDAR scan to detect scene changes with respect to the map. Using a novel loss function, existing point-cloud semantic segmentation networks can be trained to perform change detection without any labels or assumptions about local semantics. We demonstrate the performance of this approach on data from challenging terrains; mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores range between 67.4% and 82.2% depending on the amount of environmental structure. This outperforms the geometric baseline used in all experiments. The neural network runs faster than 10Hz and is integrated into a robot's autonomy stack to allow safe navigation around obstacles that intersect the planned path. In addition, a novel method for the rapid automated acquisition of per-point ground-truth labels is described. Covering changed parts of the scene with retroreflective materials and applying a threshold filter to the intensity channel of the LiDAR allows for quantitative evaluation of the change detector.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of safe navigation for rigid-body mobile robots in dynamic environments. We introduce an analytic approach to compute the distance between a polygon and an ellipse, and employ it to construct a control barrier function (CBF) for safe control synthesis. Existing CBF design methods for mobile robot obstacle avoidance usually assume point or circular robots, preventing their applicability to more realistic robot body geometries. Our work enables CBF designs that capture complex robot and obstacle shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulations highlighting real-time obstacle avoidance in constrained and dynamic environments for both mobile robots and multi-joint robot arms.</description>

Abstract: We study the choice of action space in robot manipulation learning and sim-to-real transfer. We define metrics that assess the performance, and examine the emerging properties in the different action spaces. We train over 250 reinforcement learning~(RL) agents in simulated reaching and pushing tasks, using 13 different control spaces. The choice of spaces spans combinations of common action space design characteristics. We evaluate the training performance in simulation and the transfer to a real-world environment. We identify good and bad characteristics of robotic action spaces and make recommendations for future designs. Our findings have important implications for the design of RL algorithms for robot manipulation tasks, and highlight the need for careful consideration of action spaces when training and transferring RL agents for real-world robotics.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Reinforcement and Imitation Learning for Vision-driven Autonomous Flight of UAV Along River</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along complex riverine environments for tasks like rescue and surveillance requires a robust control policy, which is yet difficult to obtain due to the shortage of trainable riverine environment simulators. To easily verify the vision-based navigation controller performance for the river following task before real-world deployment, we developed a trainable photo-realistic dynamics-free riverine simulation environment using Unity. In this paper, we address the shortcomings that vanilla Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm encounters in learning a navigation policy within this partially observable, non-Markovian environment. We propose a synergistic approach that integrates RL and Imitation Learning (IL). Initially, an IL expert is trained on manually collected demonstrations, which then guides the RL policy training process. Concurrently, experiences generated by the RL agent are utilized to re-train the IL expert, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen data. By leveraging the strengths of both RL and IL, this framework achieves a faster convergence rate and higher performance compared to pure RL, pure IL, and RL combined with static IL algorithms. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of both task completion and efficiency. The code and trainable environments are available.</description>

      <title>The Machine Vision Iceberg Explained: Advancing Dynamic Testing by Considering Holistic Environmental Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Vision (MV) is essential for solving driving automation. This paper examines potential shortcomings in current MV testing strategies for highly automated driving (HAD) systems. We argue for a more comprehensive understanding of the performance factors that must be considered during the MV evaluation process, noting that neglecting these factors can lead to significant risks. This is not only relevant to MV component testing, but also to integration testing. To illustrate this point, we draw an analogy to a ship navigating towards an iceberg to show potential hidden challenges in current MV testing strategies. The main contribution is a novel framework for black-box testing which observes environmental relations. This means it is designed to enhance MV assessments by considering the attributes and surroundings of relevant individual objects. The framework provides the identification of seven general concerns about the object recognition of MV, which are not addressed adequately in established test processes. To detect these deficits based on their performance factors, we propose the use of a taxonomy called "granularity orders" along with a graphical representation. This allows an identification of MV uncertainties across a range of driving scenarios. This approach aims to advance the precision, efficiency, and completeness of testing procedures for MV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem. A video demonstrating the proposed architecture in multiple complex traffic scenarios can be found here: https://youtu.be/-pRiOnPb9_c.

      <title>Anatomy of a Robotaxi Crash: Lessons from the Cruise Pedestrian Dragging Mishap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An October 2023 crash between a GM Cruise robotaxi and a pedestrian in San Francisco resulted not only in a severe injury, but also dramatic upheaval at that company that will likely have lasting effects throughout the industry. Is-sues stem not just from the loss events themselves, but also from how Cruise mishandled dealing with their robotaxi dragging a pedestrian under the vehicle after the initial post-crash stop. External investigation reports provide raw material describing the incident and critique the company's response from a regulatory point of view, but exclude safety engineering recommendations from scope. We highlight specific facts and relationships among events by tying together different pieces of the external report material. We then explore safety lessons that might be learned related to: recognizing and responding to nearby mishaps, building an accurate world model of a post-collision scenario, the in-adequacy of a so-called "minimal risk condition" strategy in complex situations, poor organizational discipline in responding to a mishap, overly aggressive post-collision automation choices that made a bad situation worse, and a reluctance to admit to a mishap causing much worse organizational harm down-stream.</description>

      <title>LaserSAM: Zero-Shot Change Detection Using Visual Segmentation of Spinning LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for applying camera perception techniques to spinning LiDAR data. To improve the robustness of long-term change detection from a 3D LiDAR, range and intensity information are rendered into virtual perspectives using a pinhole camera model. Hue-saturation-value image encoding is used to colourize the images by range and near-IR intensity. The LiDAR's active scene illumination makes it invariant to ambient brightness, which enables night-to-day change detection without additional processing. Using the range-colourized, perspective image allows existing foundation models to detect semantic regions. Specifically, the Segment Anything Model detects semantically similar regions in both a previously acquired map and live view from a path-repeating robot. By comparing the masks in both views, changes in the live scan are detected. Results indicate that the Segment Anything Model accurately captures the shape of arbitrary changes introduced into scenes. The proposed method achieves a segmentation intersection over union of 73.3% when evaluated in unstructured environments and 80.4% when evaluated within the planning corridor. Changes can be detected reliably through day-to-night illumination variations. After pixel-level masks are generated, the one-to-one correspondence with 3D points means that the 2D masks can be used directly to recover the 3D location of the changes. The detected 3D changes are avoided in a closed loop by treating them as obstacles in a local motion planner. Experiments on an unmanned ground vehicle demonstrate the performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots must maintain safety, but should not sacrifice performance, leading to the classical reach-avoid problem. This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-aware Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Assembly under Partial Observability with a Soft Wrist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study tackles the representative yet challenging contact-rich peg-in-hole task of robotic assembly, using a soft wrist that can operate more safely and tolerate lower-frequency control signals than a rigid one. Previous studies often use a fully observable formulation, requiring external setups or estimators for the peg-to-hole pose. In contrast, we use a partially observable formulation and deep reinforcement learning from demonstrations to learn a memory-based agent that acts purely on haptic and proprioceptive signals. Moreover, previous works do not incorporate potential domain symmetry and thus must search for solutions in a bigger space. Instead, we propose to leverage the symmetry for sample efficiency by augmenting the training data and constructing auxiliary losses to force the agent to adhere to the symmetry. Results in simulation with five different symmetric peg shapes show that our proposed agent can be comparable to or even outperform a state-based agent. In particular, the sample efficiency also allows us to learn directly on the real robot within 3 hours.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method includes an iterative reward prediction method that stabilizes the learning process, and an uncertainty propagation method that makes the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17%, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</description>

      <title>Impedance Matching: Enabling an RL-Based Running Jump in a Quadruped Robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replicating the remarkable athleticism seen in animals has long been a challenge in robotics control. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant progress in dynamic legged locomotion control, the substantial sim-to-real gap often hinders the real-world demonstration of truly dynamic movements. We propose a new framework to mitigate this gap through frequency-domain analysis-based impedance matching between simulated and real robots. Our framework offers a structured guideline for parameter selection and the range for dynamics randomization in simulation, thus facilitating a safe sim-to-real transfer. The learned policy using our framework enabled jumps across distances of 55 cm and heights of 38 cm. The results are, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest and longest running jumps demonstrated by an RL-based control policy in a real quadruped robot. Note that the achieved jumping height is approximately 85% of that obtained from a state-of-the-art trajectory optimization method, which can be seen as the physical limit for the given robot hardware. In addition, our control policy accomplished stable walking at speeds up to 2 m/s in the forward and backward directions, and 1 m/s in the sideway direction.</description>

      <title>Quadruped robot traversing 3D complex environments with limited perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traversing 3-D complex environments has always been a significant challenge for legged locomotion. Existing methods typically rely on external sensors such as vision and lidar to preemptively react to obstacles by acquiring environmental information. However, in scenarios like nighttime or dense forests, external sensors often fail to function properly, necessitating robots to rely on proprioceptive sensors to perceive diverse obstacles in the environment and respond promptly. This task is undeniably challenging. Our research finds that methods based on collision detection can enhance a robot's perception of environmental obstacles. In this work, we propose an end-to-end learning-based quadruped robot motion controller that relies solely on proprioceptive sensing. This controller can accurately detect, localize, and agilely respond to collisions in unknown and complex 3D environments, thereby improving the robot's traversability in complex environments. We demonstrate in both simulation and real-world experiments that our method enables quadruped robots to successfully traverse challenging obstacles in various complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops methods for proving Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems subject to disturbances with an unknown distribution. We assume only a finite set of disturbance samples is available and that the true online disturbance realization may be drawn from a different distribution than the given samples. We formulate an optimization problem to search for a sum-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov function and introduce a distributionally robust version of the Lyapunov function derivative constraint. We show that this constraint may be reformulated as several SOS constraints, ensuring that the search for a Lyapunov function remains in the class of SOS polynomial optimization problems. For general systems, we provide a distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation for neural network Lyapunov function search. Simulations demonstrate the validity and efficiency of either formulation on non-linear uncertain dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex tasks across various research fields. However, transferring DRL agents to the real world is still challenging due to the significant discrepancies between simulation and reality. To address this issue, we propose a robust DRL framework that leverages platform-dependent perception modules to extract task-relevant information and train a lane-following and overtaking agent in simulation. This framework facilitates the seamless transfer of the DRL agent to new simulated environments and the real world with minimal effort. We evaluate the performance of the agent in various driving scenarios in both simulation and the real world, and compare it to human players and the PID baseline in simulation. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the gaps between different platforms and the Sim2Real gap, enabling the trained agent to achieve similar performance in both simulation and the real world, driving the vehicle effectively.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Unknown Object Instance Segmentation through Error-Informed Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate perception of unknown objects is essential for autonomous robots, particularly when manipulating novel items in unstructured environments. However, existing unknown object instance segmentation (UOIS) methods often have over-segmentation and under-segmentation problems, resulting in inaccurate instance boundaries and failures in subsequent robotic tasks such as grasping and placement. To address this challenge, this article introduces INSTA-BEER, a fast and accurate model-agnostic refinement method that enhances the UOIS performance. The model adopts an error-informed refinement approach, which first predicts pixel-wise errors in the initial segmentation and then refines the segmentation guided by these error estimates. We introduce the quad-metric boundary error, which quantifies pixel-wise true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives at the boundaries of object instances, effectively capturing both fine-grained and instance-level segmentation errors. Additionally, the Error Guidance Fusion (EGF) module explicitly integrates error information into the refinement process, further improving segmentation quality. In comprehensive evaluations conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets, INSTA-BEER outperformed state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and inference time. Moreover, a real-world robotic experiment demonstrated the practical applicability of our method in improving the performance of target object grasping tasks in cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>The Essential Role of Causality in Foundation World Models for Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, especially in large multi-modal models and conversational agents, have ignited interest in the potential of generally capable embodied agents. Such agents will require the ability to perform new tasks in many different real-world environments. However, current foundation models fail to accurately model physical interactions and are therefore insufficient for Embodied AI. The study of causality lends itself to the construction of veridical world models, which are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of possible interactions. This paper focuses on the prospects of building foundation world models for the upcoming generation of embodied agents and presents a novel viewpoint on the significance of causality within these. We posit that integrating causal considerations is vital to facilitating meaningful physical interactions with the world. Finally, we demystify misconceptions about causality in this context and present our outlook for future research.</description>

      <title>UncertaintyTrack: Exploiting Detection and Localization Uncertainty in Multi-Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have seen a significant boost in performance recently, due to strong interest from the research community and steadily improving object detection methods. The majority of tracking methods follow the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, blindly trust the incoming detections with no sense of their associated localization uncertainty. This lack of uncertainty awareness poses a problem in safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving where passengers could be put at risk due to erroneous detections that have propagated to downstream tasks, including MOT. While there are existing works in probabilistic object detection that predict the localization uncertainty around the boxes, no work in 2D MOT for autonomous driving has studied whether these estimates are meaningful enough to be leveraged effectively in object tracking. We introduce UncertaintyTrack, a collection of extensions that can be applied to multiple TBD trackers to account for localization uncertainty estimates from probabilistic object detectors. Experiments on the Berkeley Deep Drive MOT dataset show that the combination of our method and informative uncertainty estimates reduces the number of ID switches by around 19\% and improves mMOTA by 2-3%.

      <title>People Attribute Purpose to Autonomous Vehicles When Explaining Their Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cognitive science can help us understand which explanations people might expect, and in which format they frame these explanations, whether causal, counterfactual, or teleological (i.e., purpose-oriented). Understanding the relevance of these concepts is crucial for building good explainable AI (XAI) which offers recourse and actionability. Focusing on autonomous driving, a complex decision-making domain, we report empirical data from two surveys on (i) how people explain the behavior of autonomous vehicles in 14 unique scenarios (N1=54), and (ii) how they perceive these explanations in terms of complexity, quality, and trustworthiness (N2=356). Participants deemed teleological explanations significantly better quality than counterfactual ones, with perceived teleology being the best predictor of perceived quality and trustworthiness. Neither the perceived teleology nor the quality were affected by whether the car was an autonomous vehicle or driven by a person. This indicates that people use teleology to evaluate information about not just other people but also autonomous vehicles. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of explanations that are framed in terms of purpose rather than just, as is standard in XAI, the causal mechanisms involved. We release the 14 scenarios and more than 1,300 elicited explanations publicly as the Human Explanations for Autonomous Driving Decisions (HEADD) dataset.</description>
