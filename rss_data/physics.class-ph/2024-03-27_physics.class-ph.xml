      <title>RLC resonator with diode nonlinearity: Bifurcation comparison of numerical predictions and circuit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear RLC resonator is investigated experimentally and numerically using bifurcation analysis. The nonlinearity is due to the parallel combination of a semiconductor rectifier diode and a fixed capacitor. The diode's junction capacitance, diffusion capacitance, and DC current-voltage relation each contribute to the nonlinearity. The closely related RL-diode resonator has been of interest for many years since its demonstration of period-doubling cascades to chaos. In this study a direct comparison is made of dynamical regime maps produced from simulations and circuit measurements. The maps show the variety of limit cycles, their bifurcations, and regions of chaos over the 2-d parameter space of the source voltage's frequency and amplitude. The similar structures of the simulated and experimental maps suggests that the diode models commonly used in circuit simulators (e.g., SPICE) work well in bifurcation analyses, successfully predicting complex and chaotic dynamics detected in the circuit. These results may be useful for applications of varactor-loaded split ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Is the Cetaev condition inferable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of holonomic constrained systems the identification of virtual displacements is clear and consolidated: this gives the possibility, once the class of displacements have been combined with Newton's equations, to write the correct equations of motion for the constrained system. The method combines d'Alembert principle with the Lagrange formalism. As far as nonholonomic constraints are concerned, the conjecture that dates back to Ceteav actually defines a class of virtual displacements through which the method d'Alebert-Lagrange can be applied again. Much literature is dedicated to the Cetaev rule from both the theoretical and experimental points of view. The absence of a rigorous (mathematical) validation of the rule inferable from the constraint equations has been declared expired in a recent publication: our main objective is a critical investigation of the stated result.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Lagrangians and branched Hamiltonians: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, given an average power, the ascent time is minimized if a cyclist maintains a constant ground speed regardless of the slope. Herein, minimizing the time is equivalent to maximizing -- for a given uphill -- the corresponding mean ascent velocity (VAM: velocit\`a ascensionale media), which is a common training metric. We illustrate the proof with numerical examples, and show that, in general, maintaining a constant instantaneous power results in longer ascent times; both strategies result in the same time if the slope is constant. To remain within the athlete's capacity, we examine the effect of complementing the average-power constraint with a maximum-power constraint. Even with this additional constraint, the ascent time is the shortest with a modified constant-speed -- not constant-power -- strategy; as expected, both strategies result in the same time if the maximum and average powers are equal to one another. Given standard available information -- including level of fitness, quantified by the power output, and ascent profile -- our results allow to formulate reliable and convenient strategies of uphill timetrials.</description>
