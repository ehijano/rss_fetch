      <title>Optics experiments as a tool for developing critical thinking in physics education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental activities are an essential part of physics education. In addition to conveying scientific knowledge, they play a significant role in developing scientific literacy, inquiry skills, and critical thinking. In today's world, where students are exposed to vast amounts of information of varying quality, the ability to analyse, evaluate, and interpret information correctly has become increasingly important. This paper presents a series of physics experiments in the field of optics, specifically designed to foster critical thinking at various stages of the inquiry process. The topic of optics was chosen deliberately, as many optical phenomena occur naturally in everyday life, are familiar to students, and stimulate their curiosity. At the same time, they provide space for formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting data, and evaluating alternative explanations. Each experiment begins with a real-life problem situation that students are expected to explore and resolve through their own investigative work. The tasks are structured to encourage discussion, require argumentation, and promote reflection on both the process and the outcomes. The proposed experiments are suitable for students at both primary and secondary school levels and can be implemented in formal as well as non-formal educational settings. The aim of this contribution is to demonstrate how well-designed and pedagogically grounded experiments can not only enhance the understanding of physical concepts but also systematically develop critical thinking skills - one of the key competencies of 21st-century education.</description>

      <title>Report on the Scoping Workshop on AI in Science Education Research 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report summarizes the outcomes of a two-day international scoping workshop on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education research. As AI rapidly reshapes scientific practice, classroom learning, and research methods, the field faces both new opportunities and significant challenges. The report clarifies key AI concepts to reduce ambiguity and reviews evidence of how AI influences scientific work, teaching practices, and disciplinary learning. It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for training, infrastructure, and standards, along with guidance for funders, policymakers, professional organizations, and academic departments. The goal is to support principled and methodologically sound use of AI in science education research.</description>
