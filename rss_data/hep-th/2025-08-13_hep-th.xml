      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Correlators from Thermal Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic thermal two-point functions can be analyzed using the operator product expansion which contains contributions from both multi-stress-tensor and double-trace operators. The former can be computed by analyzing the bulk equation of motion in a near-boundary expansion, but the latter has remained elusive-in practice, one resorts to solving a partial differential equation with limited accuracy. We show that imposing the Euclidean periodicity condition on the holographic correlator (also known as the KMS condition or thermal bootstrap), followed by Pad\'e-Borel resummation, provides an efficient method for computing double-trace thermal coefficients. The resulting series converges rapidly and yields numerical values in excellent agreement with those obtained from solving the partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Planons and their Carroll-Galilei symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of planons, particles whose mobility is restricted to a plane, through the classification of coadjoint orbits and unitary irreducible representations of the centrally extended planon group. Planons are closely related to Galilei/Bargmann symmetries and, remarkably, the often-ignored massless coadjoint orbits of the Galilei group play a central r\^ole in their description. We thereby provide a nontrivial physical interpretation of these orbits. We further construct classical and quantum dipoles as bound states of monopoles, where the restricted planar motion arises from a novel mixed Carroll-Galilei symmetry. We also argue that the simplest and already experimentally realised systems with Carroll symmetry are in crystals.</description>

      <title>Deep Finite Temperature Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to bootstrap crossing equations in Conformal Field Theory and apply it to finite temperature theories on $S^1\times \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. The proposed approach does not rely on positivity constraints and does not employ uncontrolled truncation schemes. Instead, we capture the contribution of an infinite number of operators in conformal block expansions using suitable functions, which are bootstrapped (numerically) together with a finite number of exposed CFT data. Our approach at finite temperature employs three key ingredients: $(i)$ the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, $(ii)$ thermal dispersion relations and $(iii)$ Neural Networks that model spin-dependent tail functions within the conformal block expansions. We test the efficiency of the new method in the case of Generalized Free Fields and use it to perform a preliminary bootstrap analysis of double-twist thermal data in holographic CFTs.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Holes from Homotopy Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness and rigidity of black holes remain central themes in gravitational research. In this work, we investigate the construction of all extremal black hole solutions to the Einstein equation for a given near-horizon geometry, employing the homotopy algebraic perspective, a powerful and increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory. Utilising Gau{\ss}ian null coordinates, we recast the deformation problem as an analysis of the homotopy Maurer-Cartan equation associated with an $L_\infty$-algebra. Through homological perturbation theory, we systematically solve this equation order by order in directions transverse to the near-horizon geometry. As a concrete application of this formalism, we examine the deformations of the extremal Kerr horizon. Notably, this homotopy-theoretic approach enables us to characterise the moduli space of deformations by studying only the lowest-order solutions, offering a systematic way to understand the landscape of extremal black hole geometries.</description>

      <title>On the heat kernel of non-minimal second-order operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectra of general non-minimal second-order operators. To do this, we derive the local part of the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel coefficient for such operators in a completely model-independent way. Afterwards, we provide three examples to show how our result can be applied in practical scenarios. In particular, we emphasize this discussion when dealing with a toy-model of dynamical torsion, which is viewed as a simple instance of higher-spin fields. All our results are compatible with the literature, and we provide a Mathematica notebook with the model-independent results that are written in the paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity and Entanglement in Particle Physics and Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG) entail decoherence of quantum matter propagating in it, due to an ``environment'' of QG degrees of freedom inaccessible to low-energy observers. In the first part of this talk, I discuss potential, and rather unique, effects of QG-induced decoherence on entangled particle states, specifically an induced modification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of entangled neutral-meson states in meson factories ($\omega$-effect). In the second part, I summarise a recent work in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to superradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like entangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left, right) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr geometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type anomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions. Depending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous terms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS terms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled squeezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\omega$-effect.</description>

      <title>Super-heated first order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study first order phase transitions that occur when the temperature of the system increases and we identify the conditions that lead to super-heating, a phase where the system can heat up arbitrarily. First order phase transitions with super-heating behave as inverse transitions. We quantify these claims by studying a prototypical example of a dark sector with a large number of interacting light bosons at finite temperature. Depending upon thermalisation, a super-heated phase transition in cosmology is often associated with another transition when the system is eventually cooling down, enriching the spectrum of gravitational waves from bubble collisions.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of distinct relaxation behaviour and Quantum Regression Theorem in the Ultra-strong Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC) regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.</description>

      <title>Oscillations and parity violation in gravitational wave background from extra tensor modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Emergent gauge flux in QED$_3$ with flavor chemical potential: application to magnetized U(1) Dirac spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a lattice model of non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.</description>

Abstract: The gravimagnetic dipole spacetime consists of two counter-rotating black holes of equal mass connected by a Misner string. For a particular distance in between them, the string is tensionless with the black holes at equilibrium with each other.
  The geodesics of relativistic massive, or massless particles are considered, leading to the identification of circular rotation trajectories. The velocities of these trajectories are computed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Curvature as a Probe of Exotic Core Phases in Neutron Stars within Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) on the curvature of neutron stars (NSs) by using three relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) and three hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) EOSs. Neutron stars, with their extreme densities and strong gravitational fields, provide an ideal laboratory for testing General Relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime and for exploring possible deviations via modified gravity. EMSG extends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor, characterized by a coupling parameter $\alpha$. We focus on the Kretschmann, Ricci, and Weyl curvature scalars, analyzing their dependence on baryon density and radial coordinate for varying values of $\alpha$. Our results indicate that EMSG can significantly alter the curvature profiles of neutron stars. In particular, the magnitude of both Weyl and Kretschmann scalars increases (decreases) for a positive (negative) EMSG parameter, with the former exhibiting a larger dependence. Similarly, the surface curvature (SC) is notably affected by $\alpha$. Interestingly, we further observe distinct discontinuities in the curvature profiles at hadron-quark phase transitions, especially in the soft and intermediate HQPT models. These signatures may provide observable imprints of exotic core phases in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Optical Phenomena in a Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates additional gravitational features of a newly proposed black hole spacetime within Kalb-Ramond gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections arising from a gauge-theoretic approach recently introduced in the literature [arXiv:2507.17390]. Accordingly, null geodesics are solved numerically to trace photon paths; the photon sphere and shadow are determined. From Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements of $Sgr A^{*}$, constraints on the parameters $\Theta$ (which encapsulates the non-commutativity) and $\ell$ (the Lorentz-violating parameter) are established. To examine the stability of critical orbits and the deflection angle (gravitational lensing) in the weak field scenario, we compute the Gaussian curvature in order to use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Moreover, the deflection angle has been calculated as well in the strong deflection limit. Furthermore, Lensing observables are estimated using EHT data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87$. Topological features such as the topological photon sphere are also explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stewart-Tolman effect posits that accelerating conductors exhibit both charge separation and rest-frame electric fields (``inertia of charge''), while the Ehrenfest-Tolman effect states that acceleration induces temperature gradients (``inertia of heat''). We study the interplay of these effects in thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, we derive from first principles a partial differential equation governing the electrothermal stratification of a fully ionized plasma in equilibrium under irrotational relativistic accelerations in curved spacetime. We then solve it in two settings: a plasma enclosed in a uniformly accelerated box, and a plasma shell suspended above a black hole horizon. The resulting electric fields are found not to depend on the electric conductivity of the medium.</description>

      <title>Correlators in phase-ordering from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in a QCD medium with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium using a newly proposed collision kernel that consistently incorporates the particle's momentum dependence into the relaxation time scale of the medium. The longitudinal component of the gluon self-energy, along with the Debye screening mass, is computed within the one-loop hard thermal loop framework by incorporating non-equilibrium corrections. A modified kinetic theory with an extended relaxation time approximation is employed to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of the QCD medium. The sensitivity of the heavy quarkonia potential to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is studied. Further, we studied the binding energy and thermal width of quarkonia states within this new kinetic theory. Sizable variations in the temperature behavior of these quantities are observed in comparison with the standard relaxation time approximation method due to the particle momentum dependence on the relaxation timescale of the QCD medium. Our findings highlight that accounting for the microscopic nature of the collision timescale is crucial for understanding the quarkonium behavior in a QCD medium.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by large $N$ noncommutative geometry as a model for quantum gravity. The model admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in our model. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on $- G M_1 M_2$ exactly the manner as in Newton gravity. To reproduce the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, we expect the inclusion of large $N$ corrections and quantum effects will be needed.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by a large $N$ non-commutative coordinates is proposed as a model for quantum gravity [1]. In this paper, we construct Kerr black hole as a rotating noncommutative geometry solution of this theory. Due to rotation, the fuzzy sphere is deformed into a fuzzy ellipsoid, which matches exactly the outer horizon of the Kerr black hole in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Together with a half-filled Fermi sea, the fuzzy solution reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr black hole. These results provide support that the proposed quantum mechanics of quantum spaces as a model of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometrisation of Ohm's reciprocity relation in a holographic plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently pointed out that the familiar reciprocity relation between the conductivity $\sigma$ and resistivity $\rho$, which I refer to as $\textit{Ohm's reciprocity relation}$, should not be expected to hold in all possible settings, but is rather a property that may (or may not) emerge as a consequence of specific features, or in certain limits of interest, of a given theory. In this work I prove an analogous statement: $\rho= \sigma^{-1}$, across two different classes of holographic theories related by a generalisation of the electric-magnetic duality in the $D=4+1$ bulk. In terms of the dual hydrodynamic theories, this statement is shown to imply the suppression of any contributions to the transport coefficients from dynamical electromagnetic fields, present in only one of the two theories. This makes the two theories, as far as late-time linear electric transport is concerned, equivalent. I then confirm these findings by considering one specific model and run numerical simulations in different settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the boundary wormhole fluctuations of AdS$_{3}$ spacetime and their impact on false vacuum decay. The model consists of three dimensional general relativity coupled to a real scalar field with self-interaction potential. Our analysis focuses on handlebody spacetimes, which correspond to boundary wormhole fluctuations. These fluctuations result in variations in the spacetime genus. Using the dilute wormhole gas approximation, we computed the boundary wormhole creation rate in the semiclassical region. Our results indicate that boundary wormholes are more likely to be created in spacetimes with larger absolute values of the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that smaller wormholes are more easily created compared to larger ones. Additionally, we investigated the impact of boundary wormhole fluctuations on false vacuum decay. The vacuum decay rate increases when the effects of wormhole fluctuations are considered. We show that all results remain qualitatively unchanged when certain parameter values are varied.</description>

Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical effective action in string theory is background-independent and remains invariant under higher-derivative corrections to the Buscher rules. In this work, we generalize this symmetry to incorporate higher-genus contributions, which inherently introduce background dependence into the effective action. We propose that the circularly reduced effective action should retain its invariance under combined higher-genus and higher-derivative modifications of the Buscher transformations.
  For the self-dual circle, we show that the effective action at each order in \(\alpha'\) matches its classical counterpart, up to a finite set of parameters that must be determined through loop-level S-matrix computations. Crucially, the one-loop \(\alpha'^3\) corrections arising from T-duality, when applied to backgrounds with a Killing self-dual circle, deviate from those derived in Minkowski spacetime. This difference highlights the background dependence of quantum corrections in string theory, demonstrating how spacetime geometry influences higher-order \(\alpha'\) effects.</description>

Abstract: We study massive self-interacting vector field theories with mass added ``by hand".
  We show that the massless limit of the quartic self-interacting vector field theory is not smooth. Pathological behavior of the theory is not limited only at the classical level, even at the quantum level unitarity is violated at the two-loop. Using the Vainshtein mechanism, we show that it fails beyond the strong-coupling scale and hence a massless limit is not smooth even in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>Virtual thermodynamic potential and black hole criticality</title>

Abstract: We propose a new way to relate the black hole thermodynamics and geometry by generalizing the Euclidean formalism to include "virtual geometries", which do not necessarily satisfy Einstein equations. This provides a physically well motivated route to study black hole criticality and obtain the Landau Ginzburg potential. We compute the "virtual thermodynamic potential" and show that it satisfies a modified quantum statistical relation that is compatible with the first law of black hole thermodynamics supplemented with an extra term, interpreted as virtual work in previous literature. The novelty is that, within our formalism, we can explicitly compute this term as the first derivative of the virtual thermodynamic potential with respect to the horizon radius that is considered as the order parameter. Imposing the physical condition that the first derivative vanishes is at the basis of the matching between the first law of black hole thermodynamics and (one of the) Einstein equations evaluated at the horizon. Interestingly, imposing the physical conditions that the second and third derivatives vanish, we can concretely study the criticality and existence of swallow tails. As a specific example, we apply this formalism to an exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the generalized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is included, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial critical behaviour corresponding to an inverted swallowtail.</description>

Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>

Abstract: Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their connection with the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this work, we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit and express the extracted $M_1M_2$ GDAs in terms of meson distribution amplitudes that have been constrained by the previous experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF that violates the conservation law of EMT when the hadronic matrix element of the EMT operator is considered separately for each quark flavor. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs in the perturbative limit. In the future, the GDAs and the EMT FFs studied in this paper can be probed at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, and provides a promising approach for searching for exotic hybrid mesons in future experiments.</description>
