Abstract: Flow Gym is a toolkit for research and deployment of flow-field quantification methods inspired by OpenAI Gym and Stable-Baselines3. It uses SynthPix as synthetic image generation engine and provides a unified interface for the testing, deployment and training of (learning-based) algorithms for flow-field quantification from a number of consecutive images of tracer particles. It also contains a growing number of integrations of existing algorithms and stable (re-)implementations in JAX.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Time Geodesics as a Universal Framework for Transport and Transition Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for irreversible transport phenomena in which macroscopic evolution equations arise from the combined structure of a thermodynamic state metric and an Onsager-based dissipation metric. The construction begins by defining a pseudo-Riemannian manifold from the Hessian of an appropriate thermodynamic potential. When the enthalpy is used and written in variables (S,P), the resulting metric possesses a Lorentzian-type signature: entropy acts as a time-like coordinate, while pressure forms a spatial-like coordinate associated with mechanical response. Local irreversible dynamics are incorporated through the inverse Onsager matrix, which defines a positive-definite dissipation metric on the space of fluxes and gradients. A thermodynamic action integrating these two geometric layers yields geodesic evolution equations. For a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity, the resulting Euler--Lagrange equations reproduce the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations without requiring an externally imposed constitutive closure.
  Within this framework, turbulence scaling emerges from competition between inertial curvature and dissipation metric stiffness. The Kolmogorov length scale appears as a minimum geometric resolution length where these contributions balance, providing a geometric interpretation of energy cascade termination and dissipation onset. Finite-time singularities in the classical PDE formulation correspond to curvature divergences in the transport geometry; however, the thermodynamic proper time diverges in such limits, suggesting that blow-up is dynamically suppressed in single-phase continua.
  Although derived explicitly for fluid flow, the framework is general: by choosing different thermodynamic potentials and Onsager matrices, the same geometric formulation applies to heat conduction, diffusion and other irreversible processes.</description>

      <title>A gauge identity for interscale transfer in inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interscale transfer ambiguity in inhomogeneous turbulence is resolved by identifying a gauge freedom. The identity $\Pi^{\mathrm{SGS}} = \int G_\ell \Pi^{\mathrm{KHMH}} \, d\boldsymbol{r} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J}_{\mathrm{gauge}}$ is derived, proving that subgrid and increment-based diagnostics differ strictly by a spatial divergence. This gauge current quantifies the energy redirected from the cascade to spatial redistribution, satisfying the work done on compliant boundaries. Both formulations are shown to converge to the unique Duchon-Robert dissipation, unifying diagnostics for complex flows like cerebrovascular hemodynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectral Reconstruction for Under-Resolved Turbulence Measurements Using a Variational Cutoff Dissipation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical note addresses the challenge of accurate turbulence characterization using robust, bandwidth-limited sensors which fail to resolve the high-wavenumber dissipation range. To correct the resulting underestimation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), a novel analytical spectral model is derived from a variational principle governing cascade resistance, yielding a Ginzburg-Landau domain wall solution. Unlike classical asymptotic decay formulations such as the Pao or Pope models, the proposed formulation features bounded spectral support with a hard energetic cutoff at the Kolmogorov wavenumber ($k_{\eta}$) and requires no adjustable parameters beyond the Kolmogorov constant ($C_K$). Validation against high-Reynolds-number experimental data confirms that the model accurately captures the spectral rolloff and achieves superior TKE recovery, restoring over 98\% of the variance from spectra truncated as early as $k\eta=0.15$, thereby offering a robust tool for industrial and aeroacoustic flow diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-spectral analysis of flowfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Fourier analysis of a time signal, in the discrete sense, provides the frequency content of signal under the assumption of periodicity. Although the original signal can be exactly recovered using an inverse transform, the time dependence of the spectrum remains inaccessible. There exist various time-frequency analysis techniques, such as the short time fast Fourier transform and wavelets, but those are fundamentally limited in achieving high resolution in both the time and frequency domains concurrently. For spatiotemporal flowfields, the frequency based modal decompositions generally provide spatial modes with a temporal counterpart that evolves at a constant frequency. However, an accurate time-local spectral contribution and its variation over time are highly desired to better understand the intermittent/extreme events, for instance, in turbulent flowfields. To this end, this paper presents a spectral mode decomposition that yields spectral-space and spectral-time modes, where the later along with the associated spectral energies provide a spectrogram that is at the resolution of flowfields. The spectral modes get both the frequency and energy ranks. The numerical examples demonstrate the use of technique not only in spacetime-frequency analysis but also in reduced-order modeling and denoising applications.</description>

      <title>Interphase coupling for gas-droplet flows using the fully Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method combining the fully Lagrangian approach (FLA) and kernel regression has been developed for two-way coupled simulations of evaporating sprays. The carrier phase is incompressible viscous flow described by the Navier-Stokes equations. The admixture is considered to be a cloud of monodisperse evaporating droplets, which is treated as a continuum in the FLA. All droplet parameters are calculated along selected trajectories with the number density calculated using the Lagrangian form of the continuity equation. To enable two-way coupling, the momentum and mass phase exchange terms must be calculated in each volume element of an Eulerian mesh. This is achieved by using kernel regression in conjunction with the FLA trajectory data, which retains the detail of complex structures in droplet clouds by adaptively scaling the kernel support according to the local droplet field deformation. In this work, the mass and momentum coupling source terms obtained using the FLA are assessed against reference values calculated using a standard Lagrangian particle tracking simulation that incorporates a PSI-CELL box-counting method. It is shown that the FLA retains the same level of fidelity and smoothness as the reference PSI-CELL case, whilst also providing a computational speedup factor of around 100 times due to the decreased droplet seeding.</description>

      <title>Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk &lt;&lt; 1) to always breaking for Bk &gt;&gt; 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</description>

      <title>Effects of External Magnetic Fields on the Multi-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (mRTI) is a key process in inertial confinement fusion and is thought to be widespread in the interstellar medium, where it can concentrate plasma into discrete structures. We present resistive MHD simulations of the nonlinear evolution of multi-mode mRTI in both two and three dimensions, examining the effects of uniform external magnetic fields oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the initial interface. In both 2-D and 3-D, weak parallel fields enhance mixing-zone growth, whereas stronger fields suppress it. For perpendicular fields, growth is initially inhibited but becomes enhanced at later times. These behaviors arise from magnetic tension, which modifies flow anisotropy, buoyancy, drag, and vortex dynamics. The interplay of these mechanisms governs the distinct ways in which magnetic fields influence mRTI evolution.</description>

      <title>Geese achieve stationary takeoff via synergistic wing kinematics and enhanced aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary take-off, without a running start or elevated descent, requires substantial aerodynamic forces to overcome weight, particularly for large birds such as geese exceeding 2 kg. However, the complex wing motion and high-Reynolds-number (Re $\approx$$10^5$) flow dynamics challenge conventional expectations of avian flight aerodynamics, rendering this mechanism elusive. Analyzing 578 stationary take-offs from seven geese (\textit{Anser cygnoides}) and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reveal that the complex wing kinematics collapse onto a low-dimensional manifold dominated by two synergies: a Stroke Synergy responsible for fundamental rhythmic stroke, and a Morphing Synergy governing spanwise geometry. This modular control strategy orchestrates a stereotyped wing kinematics featuring an accelerated translational downstroke and a rapid tip-reversal upstroke. By integrating wing kinematic analysis with the mass distribution of the geese, we quantified the aerodynamic forces and found that entirely positive lift and thrust are generated throughout the motion cycle. The enhanced aerodynamic performance of geese takeoff results from three principal mechanisms. During the downstroke, significant lift generated from wing acceleration is predicted by the quasi-steady framework. Flow visualization reveals that wake capture further enhances the lift generation in downstroke by orienting the position of wake vortices. During the upstroke, the distal wing performs a rapid pitching motion and generates a substantial thrust, the vertical component of which contributes significantly to weight support.</description>

      <title>Velocity dip in turbulent mixed convection of an open Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of a velocity-dip phenomenon in turbulent mixed convection in open Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard (PRB) channels with a free-slip upper boundary. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, at a fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$ and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b = 2850$. In the shear-dominated regime, the flow is characterised by small-scale structures such as near-wall streaks. As buoyancy becomes comparable to shear, streamwise-oriented large-scale rolls emerge and span the full channel height. At higher Rayleigh numbers, buoyancy dominates and the rolls fragment, giving rise to a convection-cell-dominated regime. Short-time-averaged flow fields show that streamwise rolls transport low-speed fluid from the bottom wall towards the upper boundary, forming laterally extended low-speed regions, while roll fragmentation induces upstream low-speed regions near the upper boundary. Both mechanisms locally reduce the near-surface mean velocity, leading to a velocity dip in which the maximum mean streamwise velocity is located below the upper boundary. Consistent with the mean momentum budget, the near-surface region exhibits a large-scale Reynolds shear stress that exceeds the local total shear stress, implying a negative viscous contribution and a reversal of the mean velocity gradient. To model this behaviour, we propose a model based on a balance between buoyancy and shear production with dissipation, incorporating a linear wall-normal profile for the Reynolds shear stress, a wall-normal-independent buoyancy-production term, and a decomposition of the dissipation into shear-induced and buoyancy-induced contributions. Our model accurately reproduces the DNS mean velocity profiles across the explored $Ra$ range.</description>

      <title>Passive scalar cascade in the intermediate layer of turbulent channel flow for $Pr\leq 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarities and differences between Kolmogorov scale-by-scale equilibria/non-equilibria for velocity and scalar fields are investigated in the intermediate layer of a fully developed turbulent channel flow with a passive scalar/temperature field driven by a uniform heat source. The analysis is based on intermediate asymptotics and direct numerical simulations at different Prandtl numbers lower than unity. Similarly to what happens to the velocity fluctuations, for the fluctuating scalar field Kolmogorov scale-by-scale equilibrium is achieved asymptotically around a length scale $r_{min}$, which is located below the inertial range. The lengthscale $r_{min}$ and the ratio between the inter-scale transfer and dissipation rates at $r_{min}$ vary following power laws of the Prandtl number, with exponents determined by matched asymptotics based on the hypothesis of homogeneous two-point physics in non-homogeneous turbulence. The interscale transfer rates of turbulent kinetic energy and passive scalar variance are globally similar but show evident differences when their aligned/anti-aligned contributions are considered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A slender-thread model is derived to explore the Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a filament of elasto-viscoplastic fluid. Without elasticity, a finite yield stress suppresses any linear instability for a filament of constant radius. Including sub-yield elastic deformation permits an elastic Rayleigh-Plateau instability above a critical Weissenberg number. If stresses over the thinner sections of the thread breach the yield threshold, viscoplastic deformations then drive the filament towards pinch-off. The thread consequently evolves to a beads-on-a-string structure. The elasto-plastic anatomy of the beads is explored and categorized.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Pilot-Wave Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of an experimental study of an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect achieved with the hydrodynamic pilot-wave system. A walking droplet is confined to an annular cavity that encircles a shielded vortex, but lies outside its range of direct influence. While there is no vortex-induced flow in the immediate vicinity of the droplets, the vortex modifies the droplet's spatially extended pilot-wave field that guides its motion, producing a vortex-dependent bias in the droplet's orbital speed. High-speed tracking and delay-embedding reconstructions yield Wigner-like phase-space distributions for this hydrodynamic system that exhibits a rigid, flux-dependent translation, providing a force-free, gauge-like realization of an AB-type phase.</description>

      <title>Integral modelling of weakly evaporating 3D liquid film with variable substrate heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing the dynamics of phase-changing liquid films is essential for enhancing the performance of thermal management systems. Still, direct simulation of the full governing equations is computationally expensive. To circumvent this limitation, I derived a weighted-integral boundary-layer (WIBL) model under long-wave assumptions, weak evaporation, and strong surface tension, also accounting for variable substrate heating. In the linear regime, the WIBL reproduces growth rates and the cutoff wavenumber of unstable modes with significantly higher accuracy than commonly used Benney-type models for Re&lt;40, as compared to the Orr-Sommerfeld equations. The linear analysis further reveals a threshold separating streamwise- and spanwise-dominated instabilities in hanging films, arising from the competition between Kapitza and Rayleigh-Taylor mechanisms; the WIBL predicts this threshold accurately for small Re and inclination angles. In the nonlinear regime, with substrate heating that varies in both space and time, the WIBL model captures the evolution of free-surface thickness and temperature within approximately 6% of the original Navier-Stokes equations. Three-dimensional simulations show that a condensing film undergoes dry-out due to Kapitza instability, whereas unsteady substrate heating promotes spanwise momentum spreading, modifies wave dynamics, and prevents dry-out. The WIBL model provides a good level of accuracy at a low computational cost, enabling extensive parametric studies, nonlinear stability analyses, and the design of optimal substrate-heating control strategies.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Multicomponent Ostwald Ripening in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially miscible bubble populations trapped in porous media are ubiquitous in subsurface applications such as underground hydrogen storage (UHS), where cyclic injections fragment gas into numerous bubbles with distributions of sizes and compositions. These bubbles exchange mass through Ostwald ripening, driven by differences in composition and interfacial curvature. While kinetic theories have been developed for single-component ripening in porous media, accounting for bubble deformation and spatial correlations in pore size, no such theory exists for multicomponent systems. We present the first kinetic theory for multicomponent Ostwald ripening of bubbles in porous media. The formulation describes the bubble population with a number-density function $g(s; t)$ in a 3D statistical space of bubble states $s = (R_p, S^b, y)$, consisting of pore size, bubble saturation, and composition. Evolution is governed by a population balance equation with closure through mean-field approximations that account for spatial correlations in pore size and ensure mass conservation. The theory generalizes previous single-component formulations, removing key limitations such as the inability to capture interactions between distant bubbles. Systematic validation against pore-network simulations across homogeneous, heterogeneous, correlated, and uncorrelated networks demonstrates good agreement without adjustable parameters. Pending challenges and limitations are discussed. Since the theory imposes no constraints on bubble count or correlation length, it enables predictions beyond the pore scale.</description>

      <title>A Multi-fidelity Double-Delta Wing Dataset and Empirical Scaling Laws for GNN-based Aerodynamic Field Surrogate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20941</link>

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.</description>

      <title>Quantum Homotopy Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering experiments through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like statistics can also arise from a purely local, dynamical mechanism, which we elucidate using a minimal Lorenz-like model of a walking droplet. In this model, a localized defect perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This attractor-driven, local mechanism opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs based on active particles with internal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Self-Propulsion of floating ice blocks caused by melting in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that floating ice blocks with asymmetric shapes can self-propel with significant speeds due to buoyancy driven currents caused by melting. In water baths with temperatures between $10\,^\circ$C and $30\,^\circ$C, model right-angle ice wedges are found to move in the direction opposite to the gravity current which descends along the longest inclined side. We describe the measured speed as a function of the length and angle of the inclined side, and the temperature of the bath in terms of a propulsion model which incorporates the cooling of the surrounding fluid by the melting of ice. The heat pulled from the surrounding liquid by the melting ice block generates a thermal convection flow, leading to momentum exchange and to a net propulsion force. The translation velocity is explained by balancing the propulsion force by drag. We further show that the ice block moves robustly in a saltwater bath with ocean-like salinity and maintains the same direction of motion as in freshwater. A simplified model is further developed to describe the propulsion of asymmetric ice blocks in saltwater, incorporating the effects of rising meltwater and the sinking of the surrounding bath water due to cooling. For sufficiently large temperature, we find that the cooling-induced sinking flow generates a stronger force than the upward flow from the meltwater. Consequently, the net propulsion force is in the same direction and nearly the same magnitude as that observed in freshwater. These findings suggest that melting-driven propulsion may be relevant to the motion of icebergs in sufficiently warm oceanic environments.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Curl of Vorticity as a Precursor to Dissipation in 3D Taylor--Green Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting when a three-dimensional turbulent flow reaches its dissipation peak is essential for both theory and adaptive algorithms in simulations and experiments. Using direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the Taylor--Green vortex (TGV) at resolutions of $256^3$--$1024^3$, we introduce and test a small-scale weighted diagnostic: the spectrum of $|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2$ (with $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla \times \mathbf{u}$), which, for incompressible flow, is equivalent to a $k^4$-weighted energy spectrum. We show that the peak wavenumber of this spectrum, $k_{{\rm peak}}[\,|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\,]$, advances rapidly to intermediate-small scales and then levels off before the dissipation rate $\varepsilon(t)=\sum_k 2\nu k^2 E(k)$ reaches its maximum. Across all resolutions, we observe robust temporal ordering $t_k&lt;t_\varepsilon&lt;t_\Pi$, where $t_k$ marks the onset of the rapid rise of $k_{{\rm peak}}[\,|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\,]$, $t_\varepsilon$ is the time of the maximal $\varepsilon(t)$, and $t_\Pi$ is when the cumulative flux $|\Pi(K)|$ attains its largest peak scale. This early-warning signal correlates with the morphological transition to filament-dominated structures visible in $Q$-criterion isosurfaces and is consistent with integral-scale trends ($L_{{\rm int}},\lambda,\eta$). The diagnostic is simple to compute from standard DNS data and highlights the incipient formation of high-curvature structures, where viscosity acts most strongly.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity. We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>
