      <title>Existence and higher regularity of statistically steady states for the stochastic Coleman-Gurtin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. We show that for a broad class of non-linear potentials, the system always admits invariant probability measures. However, the presence of memory effects precludes access to compactness in a typical fashion. In this paper, this obstacle is overcome by introducing functional spaces adapted to the memory kernels, thereby allowing one to recover compactness. Under the assumption of sufficiently smooth noise, it is then shown that the statistically stationary states possess higher-order regularity properties dictated by the structure of the nonlinearity. This is established through a control argument that asymptotically transfers regularity onto the solution by exploiting the underlying Lyapunov structure of the system in a novel way.</description>

      <title>A proof of self-organized criticality in a sandpile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld introduced self-organized criticality with the example of a growing sandpile that reaches then sustains a critical density. They presented the abelian sandpile as a potential model. About a decade later, Dickman, Mu\~noz, Vespignani, and Zapperi claimed that self-organizing sandpile models share their critical densities with parametrized model versions that have conventional phase transitions. Fey, Levine, and Wilson subsequently demonstrated that this fails to occur with the abelian sandpile model. However, the primary subject of Dickman et al.'s work was stochastic sandpile models, and it was widely speculated that their paradigm might still hold in that setting. To this end, we confirm a conjecture of Levine and Silvestri by providing the first rigorous proof that activated random walk in dimension one is driven directly to a critical density corresponding to a parametrized phase transition and then remains there.</description>

      <title>The connectivity and phase transition in inhomogeneous random graphs of finite types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant generalization of the Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph model is an `inhomogeneous' random graph where the edge probabilities vary according to vertex types. We identify the threshold value for this random graph with a finite number of vertex types to be connected and examine the model's behavior near this threshold value. In particular, we show that the threshold value is $c \frac{\log n }{n}$ for some $c&gt;0$ which is explicitly determined, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. Furthermore, we prove that near the threshold, the graph consists of a giant component and isolated vertices. We also investigate the phase transition and provide an alternative proof of the results by Bollob\'as et al. [Random Struct. Algorithms, 31, 3-122 (2007)]. Our proofs are based on an exploration process that corresponds to the graph, and instead of relying heavily on branching processes, we employ a random walk constructed from the exploration process. We then apply a large deviations theory to show that a reasonably large component is always significantly larger, a strategy used in both connectivity and phase transition analysis.</description>

      <title>Stein's Method for Spatial Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive Stein's method for approximating a spatial random graph by a generalised random geometric graph, which has vertices given by a finite Gibbs point process and edges based on a general connection function. Our main theorems provide explicit upper bounds for integral probability metrics and, at improved rates, a recently introduced Wasserstein metric for random graph distributions. The bounds are in terms of a vertex error term based on the Papangelou kernels of the vertex point processes and two edge error terms based on conditional edge probabilities. In addition to providing new tools for spatial random graphs along the way, such as a graph-based Georgii--Nguyen--Zessin formula, we also give applications of our bounds to the percolation graph of large balls in a Boolean model and to discretising a generalised random geometric graph.</description>

      <title>Growing conditioned BGW trees with log-concave offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given a log-concave offspring distribution, the corresponding sequence of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have $n\geq 1$ vertices admits a realization as a Markov process $(T_n)_{n\geq1}$ which adds a new ``right-leaning'' leaf at each step. This applies for instance to offspring distributions which are Poisson, binomial, geometric, or any convolution of those. By a negative result of Janson, the log-concavity condition is optimal in the restricted case of offspring distributions supported in $\{0,1,2\}$. We then prove a generalization to the case of an offspring distribution supported on an arithmetic progression, if we assume log-concavity along that progression.
  As an application, we deduce the existence of increasing couplings in an inhomogeneous model of random subtrees of the Ulam--Harris tree.
  These results generalize a construction of Luczak and Winkler which applies to uniformly sampled subtrees with $n$ vertices of the infinite complete $d$-ary trees. Our proofs are elementary and we tried to make them as self-contained as possible.</description>

      <title>Coupling Methods and Applications on the Exponential Contractivity for Path Dependent McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using coupling by change of conditional probability measure, the log-Harnack inequality for path dependent McKean-Vlasov SDEs with distribution dependent diffusion coefficients is established, which together with the exponential contractivity in $L^2$-Wasserstein distance due to synchronous coupling yields the exponential contractivity in relative entropy under the uniformly dissipative condition. When the coefficients are only partially dissipative, the exponential contractivity in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance is also derived in the aid of asymptotic reflection coupling, which is new even in the distribution independent case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Moksha-Patam, often known as `Chutes and Ladders', is a widely played indoor game worldwide. While studies have been conducted regarding the nature of an individual board, the possibilities that open up when we change the positions of the chutes and the ladders on a board are mostly unventured. In this article, we classify and study the different possible types of Moksha-Patam Boards, introduce a naming convention for them and establish a count for the boards that can be constructed adhering to some basic assumptions of the game.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of a semi-implicit time Euler scheme for a 2D B\'enard-Boussinesq model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a semi-implicit time Euler scheme for the two-dimensional B\'enard-Boussinesq model on the torus D converges. The rate of convergence in probability is almost 1/2 for a multiplicative noise; this relies on moment estimates in various norms for the processes and the scheme.
  In case of an additive noise, due to the coupling of the equations, provided that the difference on temperature between the top and bottom parts of the torus is not too big compared to the viscosity and thermal diffusivity, a strong polynomial rate of convergence (almost 1/2) is proven in $(L^2(D))^2$ for the velocity and in $L^2(D)$ for the temperature.
  It depends on exponential moments of the scheme; due to linear terms involving the other quantity in both evolution equations, the proof has to be done simultaneaously for both the velocity and the temperature. These rates in both cases are similar to that obtained for the Navier-Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and Approximation of Probability Functions under Gaussian Mixture Models: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study probability functions associated with Gaussian mixture models. Our primary focus is on extending the use of spherical radial decomposition for multivariate Gaussian random vectors to the context of Gaussian mixture models, which are not inherently spherical but only conditionally so. Specifically, the conditional probability distribution, given a random parameter of the random vector, follows a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to apply Bayesian analysis tools to the probability function. This assumption, together with spherical radial decomposition for Gaussian random vectors, enables us to represent the probability function as an integral over the Euclidean sphere. Using this representation, we establish sufficient conditions to ensure the differentiability of the probability function and provide and integral representation of its gradient. Furthermore, leveraging the Bayesian decomposition, we approximate the probability function using random sampling over the parameter space and the Euclidean sphere. Finally, we present numerical examples that illustrate the advantages of this approach over classical approximations based on random vector sampling.</description>

      <title>New random projections for isotropic kernels using stable spectral distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht [31] introduced the idea of decomposing shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any shift-invariant kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose to decompose spectral kernel distributions as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors. This provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for a very large class of multivariate shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power kernels, generalized Mat\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and Tricomi kernels. In particular, we show that the spectral densities of all these kernels are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. This provides a very simple way to modify existing Random Fourier Features software based on Gaussian kernels to cover a much richer class of multivariate kernels. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>

      <title>Community detection with the Bethe-Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq 2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii) As $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.</description>

      <title>Webs and multiwebs for the symplectic group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define $2n$-multiwebs on planar graphs and discuss their relation with $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$-webs. On a planar graph with a symplectic local system we define a matrix whose Pfaffian is the sum of traces of $2n$-multiwebs. As application we generalize Kasteleyn's theorem from dimer covers to $2n$-multiweb covers of planar graphs with $U(n)$ gauge group.
  For $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ we relate Kuperberg's ``tetravalent vertex'' to the determinant, and classify reduced $4$-webs on some simple surfaces: the annulus, torus, and pair of pants.
  We likewise define, for $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ and $q=1$, a $2n$-valent vertex corresponding to the determinant, and classify reduced $2n$-webs on an annulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the density of states of structured Hermitian random matrices with a variance profile. As the dimension tends to infinity the associated eigenvalue density can develop a singularity at the origin. The severity of this singularity depends on the relative positions of the zero submatrices. We provide a classification of all possible singularities and determine the exponent in the density blow-up, which we label the singularity degree.</description>

      <title>Stable distributions and domains of attraction for unitarily invariant Hermitian random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random matrix ensembles on the set of Hermitian matrices that are heavy tailed, in particular not all moments exist, and that are invariant under the conjugate action of the unitary group. The latter property entails that the eigenvectors are Haar distributed and, therefore, factorise from the eigenvalue statistics. We prove a classification for stable matrix ensembles of this kind of matrices represented in terms of matrices, their eigenvalues and their diagonal entries with the help of the classification of the multivariate stable distributions and the harmonic analysis on symmetric matrix spaces. Moreover, we identify sufficient and necessary conditions for their domains of attraction. To illustrate our findings we discuss for instance elliptical invariant random matrix ensembles and P\'olya ensembles, the latter playing a particular role in matrix convolutions. As a byproduct we generalise the derivative principle on the Hermitian matrices to general tempered distributions. This principle relates the joint probability density of the eigenvalues and the diagonal entries of the random matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinite harmonic chain of charged particles submitted to the action of a magnetic field of intensity $B$ and subject to the action of a stochastic noise conserving the energy. In arXiv:0809.0177 and arXiv:1402.2988 it has been proved that if $B=0$ the transport of energy is described by a $3/4$-fractional diffusion while it has been proved in arXiv:1808.01040 that if $B\ne 0$ it is described by a $5/6$-fractional diffusion. In arXiv:0809.0177 and in arXiv:1808.01040 the authors used a two step argument, i.e. they first proved that the kinetic limit of the Wigner distribution is the solution of a phonon Boltzmann equation and then proved that this solution converges to the solution of a fractional diffusion equation with exponent $3/4$ if $B = 0$ (see arXiv:0809.0177) and exponent $5/6$ if $B\ne 0$ (see arXiv:1808.01040). In this paper we quantify the intensity of the magnetic field required to switch from one macroscopic regime to the other one from the phonon Boltzmann equation. We also describe the transition mechanism to cross the two different phases.</description>

Abstract: We study a critical branching random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$. We focus on the tail of the time spent in a ball, and our study, in dimension four and higher, sheds new light on the recent result of Angel, Hutchcroft and Jarai, in particular on the special features of the critical dimension four. Finally, we analyse the number of walks transported by the branching random walk on the boundary of a distant ball.</description>

      <title>Complex balanced distributions for chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction networks have become a major modelling framework in the biological sciences from epidemiology and population biology to genetics and cellular biology. In recent years, much progress has been made on stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) that in particular are applicable when copy numbers are low (as in cellular systems) or when noise and drift are ubiquitous (as in population genetic models). Often a main interest is the long term behaviour of a system: does the system settle towards stochastic equilibrium in some sense? In that context, we are concerned with SRNs, modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their stationary distributions. In particular, we are interested in complex balanced stationary distributions, where the probability flow out of a complex equals the flow into the complex. We characterise the existence and the form of complex balanced distributions of SRNs with arbitrary transition functions through conditions on the cycles of a corresponding digraph (the reaction graph). Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a complex balanced distribution and give precise conditions for when it is also necessary. The sufficient condition is also necessary for mass-action kinetics (and certain generalisations of that) or if the digraph consists of only cyclic connected components. Moreover, we state a deficiency theorem, a generalisation of the deficiency theorem for stochastic mass-action kinetics to arbitrary stochastic genetics. The theorem gives the co-dimension of the parameter space for which a complex balanced distribution exists.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free comparison estimates for suprema of some canonical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain error approximation bounds between expected suprema of canonical processes that are generated by random vectors with independent coordinates and expected suprema of Gaussian processes. In particular, we obtain a sharper proximity estimate for Rademacher and Gaussian complexities. Our estimates are dimension-free, and depend only on the geometric parameters and the numerical complexity of the underlying index set.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Product-form Steady-state for Multiclass Queueing Networks with SBP Service Policies in Multi-scale Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stationary distribution of the scaled queue length vector process in multiclass queueing networks operating under static buffer priority service policies. We establish that when subjected to a multi-scale heavy traffic condition, the stationary distribution converges to a product-form limit, with each component in the product form following an exponential distribution. A major assumption in proving the desired product-form limit is the uniform moment bound for scaled queue lengths. We prove this assumption holds if the unscaled high-priority queue lengths have uniform moment bound and a certain reflection matrix is a P-matrix.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the original version of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) presented in Ho, J., Jain, A., and Abbeel, P., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. Our main theorem states that the sequence constructed by the original DDPM sampling algorithm weakly converges to a given data distribution as the number of time steps goes to infinity, under some asymptotic conditions on the parameters for the variance schedule, the $L^2$-based score estimation error, and the noise estimating function with respect to the number of time steps. In proving the theorem, we reveal that the sampling sequence can be seen as an exponential integrator type approximation of a reverse time stochastic differential equation over a finite time interval.</description>

      <title>Carath\'eodory Theory and A Priori Estimates for Continuity Inclusions in the Space of Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the foundations of the theory of differential inclusions in the space of compactly supported probability measures, introduced recently by the authors, to the setting of general Wasserstein spaces. In this context, we prove a novel existence result \`a la Peano for this class of dynamics under mere Carath\'eodory regularity assumptions. The latter is based on a natural, yet previously unexplored set-valued adaptation of the semi-discrete Euler scheme proposed by Filippov to study ordinary differential equations whose right-hand sides are measurable in the time variable. By leveraging some of the underlying methods along with new estimates for solutions of continuity equations, we also bring substantial improvements to the earlier versions of the Filippov estimates, compactness and relaxation properties of the solution sets of continuity inclusions, which are derived in the Cauchy-Lipschitz framework.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equations on homogeneous Lie groups and probabilistic counterparts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the well-posedness of subelliptic Fokker-Planck equations arising from stochastic control problems, as well as the properties of the associated diffusion processes. Here, the main difficulty arises from the possible polynomial growth of the coefficients, which is related to the growth of the family of vector fields generating the first layer of the associated Lie algebra. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the energy solution, and its representation as the transition density of the underlying subelliptic diffusion process. Moreover, we show its Holder continuity in time w.r.t.the Fortet-Mourier distance, where the Holder seminorm depends on the degree of homogeneity of the vector fields. Finally, we provide a probabilistic proof of the Feyman-Kac formula, as a consequence of the uniform boundedness in finite time intervals of all moments.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored extensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A. distributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024], B. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in online graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023].
  We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these models of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show that all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and what we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on the quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new barrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1. All LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality $O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a new barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using causality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or any of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many implications is that in rooted trees, $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in quantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in classical LOCAL.</description>

      <title>Elementary econometric and strategic analysis of curling matches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Markov model of curling matches, parametrised by the probability of winning an end and the probability distribution of scoring ends. In practical applications, these end-winning probabilities can be estimated econometrically, and are shown to depend on which team holds the hammer, as well as the offensive and defensive strengths of the respective teams. Using a maximum entropy argument, based on the idea of characteristic scoring patterns in curling, we predict that the points distribution of scoring ends should follow a constrained geometric distribution. We provide analytical results detailing when it is optimal to blank the end in preference to scoring one point and losing possession of the hammer. Statistical and simulation analysis of international curling matches is also performed.</description>

      <title>Random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries and the Cohen--Lenstra distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of the cokernels of random $p$-adic matrices with fixed zero entries. Let $X_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ in which some entries are fixed to be zero and the other entries are i.i.d. copies of a random variable $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. We consider the minimal number of random entries of $X_n$ required for the cokernel of $X_n$ to converge to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution. When $\xi$ is given by the Haar measure, we prove a lower bound of the number of random entries and prove its converse-type result using random regular bipartite multigraphs. When $\xi$ is a general random variable, we determine the minimal number of random entries. Let $M_n$ be a random $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $k$-step stairs of zeros and the other entries given by independent random $\epsilon$-balanced variables valued in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We prove that the cokernel of $M_n$ converges to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution under a mild assumption. This extends Wood's universality theorem on random $p$-adic matrices.</description>

      <title>Some easy optimization problems have the overlap-gap property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>
