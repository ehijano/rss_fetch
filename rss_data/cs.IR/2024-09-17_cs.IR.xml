      <title>LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated and timely conversion of cybersecurity information from unstructured online sources, such as blogs and articles to more formal representations has become a necessity for many applications in the domain nowadays. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the early phases towards this goal. It involves the detection of the relevant domain entities, such as product, version, attack name, etc. in technical documents. Although generally considered a simple task in the information extraction field, it is quite challenging in some domains like cybersecurity because of the complex structure of its entities. The state of the art methods require time-consuming and labor intensive feature engineering that describes the properties of the entities, their context, domain knowledge, and linguistic characteristics. The model demonstrated in this paper is domain independent and does not rely on any features specific to the entities in the cybersecurity domain, hence does not require expert knowledge to perform feature engineering. The method used relies on a type of recurrent neural networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) method. The results we obtained showed that this method outperforms the state of the art methods given an annotated corpus of a decent size.</description>

      <title>Bridging User Dynamics: Transforming Sequential Recommendations with Schr\"odinger Bridge and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to accurately capture the dynamic changes in user interests. We have noticed that generative models, especially diffusion models, which have achieved significant results in fields like image and audio, hold considerable promise in the field of sequential recommendation. However, existing sequential recommendation methods based on diffusion models are constrained by a prior distribution limited to Gaussian distribution, hindering the possibility of introducing user-specific information for each recommendation and leading to information loss. To address these issues, we introduce the Schr\"odinger Bridge into diffusion-based sequential recommendation models, creating the SdifRec model. This allows us to replace the Gaussian prior of the diffusion model with the user's current state, directly modeling the process from a user's current state to the target recommendation. Additionally, to better utilize collaborative information in recommendations, we propose an extended version of SdifRec called con-SdifRec, which utilizes user clustering information as a guiding condition to further enhance the posterior distribution. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of SdifRec and con-SdifRec through comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. Further in-depth analysis has validated their efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a system's ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework.
  ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Googling the Big Lie: Search Engines, News Media, and the US 2020 Election Conspiracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conspiracy theory that the US 2020 presidential election was fraudulent - the Big Lie - remained a prominent part of the media agenda months after the election. Whether and how search engines prioritized news stories that sought to thoroughly debunk the claims, provide a simple negation, or support the conspiracy is crucial for understanding information exposure on the topic. We investigate how search engines provided news on this conspiracy by conducting a large-scale algorithm audit evaluating differences between three search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, and Bing), across three locations (Ohio, California, and the UK), and using eleven search queries. Results show that simply denying the conspiracy is the largest debunking strategy across all search engines. While Google has a strong mainstreaming effect on articles explicitly focused on the Big Lie - providing thorough debunks and alternative explanations - DuckDuckGo and Bing display, depending on the location, a large share of articles either supporting the conspiracy or failing to debunk it. Lastly, we find that niche ideologically driven search queries (e.g., "sharpie marker ballots Arizona") do not lead to more conspiracy-supportive material. Instead, content supporting the conspiracy is largely a product of broader ideology-agnostic search queries (e.g., "voter fraud 2020").</description>

      <title>Challenging Fairness: A Comprehensive Exploration of Bias in LLM-Based Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems provide more comprehensive recommendations than traditional systems by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, these systems often exhibit biases, favoring mainstream content while marginalizing non-traditional options due to skewed training data. This study investigates the intricate relationship between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, with a focus on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. Through a comprehensive analysis conducted over different LLM-models, this paper evaluates the impact of bias on recommendation outcomes. Our findings reveal that bias is so deeply ingrained within these systems that even a simpler intervention like prompt engineering can significantly reduce bias, underscoring the pervasive nature of the issue. Moreover, factors like intersecting identities and contextual information, such as socioeconomic status, further amplify these biases, demonstrating the complexity and depth of the challenges faced in creating fair recommendations across different groups.</description>

      <title>GenCRF: Generative Clustering and Reformulation Framework for Enhanced Intent-Driven Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query reformulation is a well-known problem in Information Retrieval (IR) aimed at enhancing single search successful completion rate by automatically modifying user's input query. Recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve query reformulation, but often generate limited and redundant expansions, potentially constraining their effectiveness in capturing diverse intents. In this paper, we propose GenCRF: a Generative Clustering and Reformulation Framework to capture diverse intentions adaptively based on multiple differentiated, well-generated queries in the retrieval phase for the first time. GenCRF leverages LLMs to generate variable queries from the initial query using customized prompts, then clusters them into groups to distinctly represent diverse intents. Furthermore, the framework explores to combine diverse intents query with innovative weighted aggregation strategies to optimize retrieval performance and crucially integrates a novel Query Evaluation Rewarding Model (QERM) to refine the process through feedback loops. Empirical experiments on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that GenCRF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous query reformulation SOTAs by up to 12% on nDCG@10. These techniques can be adapted to various LLMs, significantly boosting retriever performance and advancing the field of Information Retrieval.</description>

      <title>A Best-of-Both Approach to Improve Match Predictions and Reciprocal Recommendations for Job Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching users with mutual preferences is a critical aspect of services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search. To produce recommendations in such scenarios, one can predict match probabilities and construct rankings based on these predictions. However, this direct match prediction approach often underperforms due to the extreme sparsity of match labels. Therefore, most existing methods predict preferences separately for each direction (e.g., job seeker to employer and employer to job seeker) and then aggregate the predictions to generate overall matching scores and produce recommendations. However, this typical approach often leads to practical issues, such as biased error propagation between the two models. This paper introduces and demonstrates a novel and practical solution to improve reciprocal recommendations in production by leveraging \textit{pseudo-match scores}. Specifically, our approach generates dense and more directly relevant pseudo-match scores by combining the true match labels, which are accurate but sparse, with relatively inaccurate but dense match predictions. We then train a meta-model to output the final match predictions by minimizing the prediction loss against the pseudo-match scores. Our method can be seen as a \textbf{best-of-both (BoB) approach}, as it combines the high-level ideas of both direct match prediction and the two separate models approach. It also allows for user-specific weights to construct \textit{personalized} pseudo-match scores, achieving even better matching performance through appropriate tuning of the weights. Offline experiments on real-world job search data demonstrate the superior performance of our BoB method, particularly with personalized pseudo-match scores, compared to existing approaches in terms of finding potential matches.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Generative Models in Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recommendation systems limit user inputs to text strings or behavior signals such as clicks and purchases, and system outputs to a list of products sorted by relevance. With the advent of generative AI, users have come to expect richer levels of interactions. In visual search, for example, a user may provide a picture of their desired product along with a natural language modification of the content of the picture (e.g., a dress like the one shown in the picture but in red color). Moreover, users may want to better understand the recommendations they receive by visualizing how the product fits their use case, e.g., with a representation of how a garment might look on them, or how a furniture item might look in their room. Such advanced levels of interaction require recommendation systems that are able to discover both shared and complementary information about the product across modalities, and visualize the product in a realistic and informative way. However, existing systems often treat multiple modalities independently: text search is usually done by comparing the user query to product titles and descriptions, while visual search is typically done by comparing an image provided by the customer to product images. We argue that future recommendation systems will benefit from a multi-modal understanding of the products that leverages the rich information retailers have about both customers and products to come up with the best recommendations. In this chapter we review recommendation systems that use multiple data modalities simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Promptriever: Instruction-Trained Retrievers Can Be Prompted Like Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned language models (LM) are able to respond to imperative commands, providing a more natural user interface compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we present Promptriever, the first retrieval model able to be prompted like an LM. To train Promptriever, we curate and release a new instance-level instruction training set from MS MARCO, spanning nearly 500k instances. Promptriever not only achieves strong performance on standard retrieval tasks, but also follows instructions. We observe: (1) large gains (reaching SoTA) on following detailed relevance instructions (+14.3 p-MRR / +3.1 nDCG on FollowIR), (2) significantly increased robustness to lexical choices/phrasing in the query+instruction (+12.9 Robustness@10 on InstructIR), and (3) the ability to perform hyperparameter search via prompting to reliably improve retrieval performance (+1.4 average increase on BEIR). Promptriever demonstrates that retrieval models can be controlled with prompts on a per-query basis, setting the stage for future work aligning LM prompting techniques with information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Beyond Relevance: Improving User Engagement by Personalization for Short-Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized search has been extensively studied in various applications, including web search, e-commerce, social networks, etc. With the soaring popularity of short-video platforms, exemplified by TikTok and Kuaishou, the question arises: can personalization elevate the realm of short-video search, and if so, which techniques hold the key?
  In this work, we introduce $\text{PR}^2$, a novel and comprehensive solution for personalizing short-video search, where $\text{PR}^2$ stands for the Personalized Retrieval and Ranking augmented search system. Specifically, $\text{PR}^2$ leverages query-relevant collaborative filtering and personalized dense retrieval to extract relevant and individually tailored content from a large-scale video corpus. Furthermore, it utilizes the QIN (Query-Dominate User Interest Network) ranking model, to effectively harness user long-term preferences and real-time behaviors, and efficiently learn from user various implicit feedback through a multi-task learning framework. By deploying the $\text{PR}^2$ in production system, we have achieved the most remarkable user engagement improvements in recent years: a 10.2% increase in CTR@10, a notable 20% surge in video watch time, and a 1.6% uplift of search DAU. We believe the practical insights presented in this work are valuable especially for building and improving personalized search systems for the short video platforms.</description>

      <title>MUSE: Flexible Voiceprint Receptive Fields and Multi-Path Fusion Enhanced Taylor Transformer for U-Net-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04589v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a challenging task for speech enhancement. In this paper, we introduce Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) Transformer based U-net for Speech Enhancement (MUSE), a lightweight speech enhancement network built upon the Unet architecture. Our approach incorporates a novel Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) Transformer block, which integrates Deformable Embedding (DE) to enable flexible receptive fields for voiceprints. The MET Transformer is uniquely designed to fuse Channel and Spatial Attention (CSA) branches, facilitating channel information exchange and addressing spatial attention deficits within the Taylor-Transformer framework. Through extensive experiments conducted on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, we demonstrate that MUSE achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing both training and deployment costs, boasting a mere 0.51M parameters.</description>

      <title>Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Structured Data Extraction from Diagnostic Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate an automated system for extracting structured clinical information from unstructured radiology and pathology reports using open-weights large language models (LMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and to assess the effects of model configuration variables on extraction performance. Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.</description>

      <title>Online Learning via Memory: Retrieval-Augmented Detector Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel way of online adapting any off-the-shelf object detection model to a novel domain without retraining the detector model. Inspired by how humans quickly learn knowledge of a new subject (e.g., memorization), we allow the detector to look up similar object concepts from memory during test time. This is achieved through a retrieval augmented classification (RAC) module together with a memory bank that can be flexibly updated with new domain knowledge. We experimented with various off-the-shelf open-set detector and close-set detectors. With only a tiny memory bank (e.g., 10 images per category) and being training-free, our online learning method could significantly outperform baselines in adapting a detector to novel domains.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes Attention-Seeker, an unsupervised keyphrase extraction method that leverages self-attention maps from a Large Language Model to estimate the importance of candidate phrases. Our approach identifies specific components - such as layers, heads, and attention vectors - where the model pays significant attention to the key topics of the text. The attention weights provided by these components are then used to score the candidate phrases. Unlike previous models that require manual tuning of parameters (e.g., selection of heads, prompts, hyperparameters), Attention-Seeker dynamically adapts to the input text without any manual adjustments, enhancing its practical applicability. We evaluate Attention-Seeker on four publicly available datasets: Inspec, SemEval2010, SemEval2017, and Krapivin. Our results demonstrate that, even without parameter tuning, Attention-Seeker outperforms most baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three out of four datasets, particularly excelling in extracting keyphrases from long documents.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the token transfer network on Ethereum, focusing on accounts associated with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm implicated in the misuse of FTX customer funds. Using a multi-token network representation, we examine node centralities and the network backbone to identify critical accounts, tokens, and activity groups. The temporal evolution of Alameda accounts reveals shifts in token accumulation and distribution patterns leading up to its bankruptcy in November 2022. Through network analysis, our work offers insights into the activities and dynamics that shape the DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>P-RAG: Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation For Planning on Embodied Everyday Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Everyday Task is a popular task in the embodied AI community, requiring agents to make a sequence of actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.</description>

      <title>TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling Sustainable City Trips: Integrating CO2e Emissions, Popularity, and Seasonality into Tourism Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tourism affects not only the tourism industry but also society and stakeholders such as the environment, local businesses, and residents. Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) can be pivotal in promoting sustainable tourism by guiding travelers toward destinations with minimal negative impact. Our paper introduces a composite sustainability indicator for a city trip TRS based on the users' starting point and month of travel. This indicator integrates CO2e emissions for different transportation modes and analyses destination popularity and seasonal demand. We quantify city popularity based on user reviews, points of interest, and search trends from Tripadvisor and Google Trends data. To calculate a seasonal demand index, we leverage data from TourMIS and Airbnb. We conducted a user study to explore the fundamental trade-offs in travel decision-making and determine the weights for our proposed indicator. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of this indicator into a TRS, illustrating its ability to deliver sustainable city trip recommendations. This work lays the foundation for future research by integrating sustainability measures and contributing to responsible recommendations by TRS.</description>

      <title>DrugAgent: Explainable Drug Repurposing Agent with Large Language Model-based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.</description>

      <title>Music auto-tagging in the long tail: A few-shot approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of digital music, using tags to efficiently organize and retrieve music from extensive databases is crucial for music catalog owners. Human tagging by experts is labor-intensive but mostly accurate, whereas automatic tagging through supervised learning has approached satisfying accuracy but is restricted to a predefined set of training tags. Few-shot learning offers a viable solution to expand beyond this small set of predefined tags by enabling models to learn from only a few human-provided examples to understand tag meanings and subsequently apply these tags autonomously. We propose to integrate few-shot learning methodology into multi-label music auto-tagging by using features from pre-trained models as inputs to a lightweight linear classifier, also known as a linear probe. We investigate different popular pre-trained features, as well as different few-shot parametrizations with varying numbers of classes and samples per class. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple model with pre-trained features can achieve performance close to state-of-the-art models while using significantly less training data, such as 20 samples per tag. Additionally, our linear probe performs competitively with leading models when trained on the entire training dataset. The results show that this transfer learning-based few-shot approach could effectively address the issue of automatically assigning long-tail tags with only limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>jina-embeddings-v3: Multilingual Embeddings With Task LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v3, a novel text embedding model with 570 million parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual data and long-context retrieval tasks, supporting context lengths of up to 8192 tokens. The model includes a set of task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to generate high-quality embeddings for query-document retrieval, clustering, classification, and text matching. Additionally, Matryoshka Representation Learning is integrated into the training process, allowing flexible truncation of embedding dimensions without compromising performance. Evaluation on the MTEB benchmark shows that jina-embeddings-v3 outperforms the latest proprietary embeddings from OpenAI and Cohere on English tasks, while achieving superior performance compared to multilingual-e5-large-instruct across all multilingual tasks.</description>
