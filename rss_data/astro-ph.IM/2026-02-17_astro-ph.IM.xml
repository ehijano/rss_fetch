      <title>Dyad: a binary-star dynamics and statistics library for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyad is a Python library for studying the dynamics of binary stars considered as gravitational two-body systems. The dynamics of a binary star are determined by its primary and secondary stars' masses along with the secondary star's six orbital elements as defined in a frame comoving with the primary star. In a population of binary stars these eight parameters vary from member to member and can each be treated as a random variable having some probability distribution. Dyad provides a class, dyad.TwoBody, and a module, dyad.stats, for dealing with such a population of binary stars. The dyad.TwoBody class represents a gravitational two-body system while the dyad.stats module provides a suite of classes representing the probability distributions of (1) stellar masses (including those proposed by Kroupa, 2001, and Salpeter, 1955) as well as (2) mass ratios and orbital elements (including those proposed by Duquennoy &amp; Mayor, 1991, and Moe &amp; Di Stefano, 2017).

      <title>Updated Sensitivities of the Five STIS L-mode Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-derivation of the sensitivities of all of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observing modes were required after major updates were introduced to the model atmospheres of the three primary standard stars. The new predicted continuum fluxes were up to 2-3% different from the models used to originally calibrate STIS. This work focuses on the re-derivation of spectral sensitivities for the five STIS low-resolution (L-mode) gratings: G140L, G230L, G230LB, G430L, and G750L, which span wavelengths from the far-ultraviolet through the near infrared. Updated photometric throughput tables were delivered to the Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) on April 7, 2022 and April 14, 2023, which triggered a recalibration of all historical STIS datasets taken with these modes. The sensitivities derived from each of the standard stars typically agree with one another to better than 1%, though discrepancies as large as 1.5% are found in spectral regions most impacted by hydrogen absorption.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Semi-Supervised Sim-to-Obs Transfer for Robust Star--Galaxy--Quasar Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern studies in astrophysics and cosmology increasingly rely on simulations and cross-survey analyses, yet differences in data generation, instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics introduce distribution mismatches between datasets (``domain shift''). In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier -- high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars -- from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS--only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS--only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches. This study shows how modest target supervision enables robust, data-efficient simulation-to-observation transfer when simulations are plentiful but target labels are scarce.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. V. Near-Infrared Camera Wide Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the absolute flux and wavelength calibration of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode. Each of NIRCam's two modules (A and B) provides independent long wavelength (LW) grism spectroscopy over the 2.4-5.0 micron range, with orthogonally oriented R and C grisms. Using commissioning and calibration data from programs 01076, 01536, 01537, 01538, 01479, 01480, 04449, 04498, 06606, and 06628, we have measured the field-dependent geometry and wavelength dispersion of both first and second order spectra across the full detector area. The trace geometry was modeled using two-dimensional third-order polynomials that reproduce the observed spectral positions with an RMS accuracy better than 0.1 pixel. Wavelength calibration, derived from observations of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58, achieves a precision of 1.6-1.9A for the +1 orders and 0.5A for the +2 orders. Absolute flux calibration, established from observations of the G-type star standard P330E, provides a consistent sensitivity function across all grisms and modules with an absolute flux accuracy of 3\%. The resulting calibration framework defines the geometric, wavelength, and photometric reference for all NIRCam WFSS observations and ensures cross-consistency between modules and grism orientations. These calibrations form the basis for accurate slitless spectroscopy with NIRCam and will support ongoing improvements to the JWST calibration pipeline and data products.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity in H4RG-10 Near-Infrared Detectors at Elevated Temperatures: Characterization and Data-Driven Correction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a newly identified nonlinearity in H4RG-10 near-infrared detectors operating under moderately elevated-temperature conditions (114 K). This component, that potentially arises from illumination-independent defect currents, introduces additional nonlinearity not captured by conventional correction models. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven nonlinearity correction (NLC) method that models the nonlinear behavior of both the classical response and the defect currents, using dual-illumination measurements and a dark exposure. Applied to H4RG-10 detectors on the PRIME telescope, the method significantly improves signal linearity, especially for pixels with high defect current, while maintaining comparable performance elsewhere. By selecting the optimal correction model per pixel, reliable NLC is achieved across the full array. This study characterizes a nonlinearity intrinsic to H4RG-10 detectors and demonstrates that data-driven post-processing can effectively restore linearity in the presence of large defect currents. Although these effects are unlikely to be significant under nominal operating temperatures, the approach may provide a practical calibration framework for future warm-operation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal polarization modulation and calibration schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the algebraic definition of the efficiency of a polarization modulation scheme, which is commonly adopted for solar and stellar spectro-polarimetry applications, and generalize it to allow distinct states of the modulation cycle to have arbitrary throughput and different photon-noise statistics for each state. Such a generalization becomes necessary to model and optimize the polarimetric efficiency of instruments implementing spatial polarization modulation schemes, where different optical paths are assigned to different polarization analysis states, which may be characterized by different throughput values. The proposed algebraic extension also proves essential for introducing a workable concept of the efficiency of a polarization calibration scheme, which can then be used to create a merit function for the optimization of calibration sequences, which take into account the specific characteristics of the polarimetric instrument and of its calibration optics.</description>

      <title>Image instabilities and polarization cross-talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand on our previous study of the impact of atmospheric seeing on polarization cross-talk, and show how the formalism that was developed in that work can be applied to treat the case of spatial modulators of polarization. Beside formally demonstrating how the problem of cross-talk is fully eliminated in such devices, we also gain insight on the meaning of polarimetric noise of temporal modulation schemes in the limit of very high modulation frequency. We also describe the problem of spectrograph instabilities, and how the spectral gradients that are naturally associated with a line spectrum feed into the problem of polarimetric errors induced by mechanical vibrations, thermal drifts, and pointing jitter. Finally, we show how this formalism can be used to estimate the contribution of polarization cross-talk to the errors on the elements of the 4$\times$4 Stokes response matrix, for the purpose of producing realistic error budgets for polarimetric instrumentation.</description>

      <title>In-orbit Demonstration of X-ray Pulsar Navigation with NinjaSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrated the pulsar navigation capability of the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat, which is equipped with two Gas Multiplier Counters (GMCs). The GMCs are sensitive to the 2-50 keV energy band and have an effective area of 16 cm^2 per module at 6 keV. We verified the timing accuracy by observing the Crab Pulsar and confirmed stable timing performance within 100 microseconds. To demonstrate pulsar navigation, we applied a method that optimizes orbital parameters to maximize the significance of the pulsar X-ray pulse profile, known as the Significance Enhancement of Pulse-profile with Orbit-dynamics (SEPO) method. We observed the Crab Pulsar with a total exposure of approximately 100 ks at different epochs and analyzed the data transmitted to the ground. By comparing the optimized orbit with the satellite position derived from Global Positioning System data, we quantitatively evaluated the navigation performance. The results show that the position component along the Crab line of sight was consistently constrained within approximately 40 km, and the three-dimensional position error ranged from 27 to 370 km depending on the observation epoch. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying a CubeSat-class X-ray observatory to pulsar navigation and provide the first experimental verification that the accuracy of the SEPO method depends on the seasonal geometry between the orbital plane and the pulsar direction.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Concept-Object Associations in Astronomy by Mining the Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025. Using an automated pipeline, we extract named astrophysical objects from OCR-processed papers, resolve them to SIMBAD identifiers, and link them to scientific concepts annotated in the source corpus. We then test whether historical graph structure can forecast new concept-object associations before they appear in print. Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively. These results indicate that historical literature encodes predictive structure not captured by global heuristics or local neighborhood voting, suggesting a path toward tools that could help triage follow-up targets for scarce telescope time.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating the Sensitivities of the STIS First-Order, Medium-Resolution Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivities of STIS first-order, medium resolution modes were redetermined from on-orbit observations and CALSPEC models (version 11) of the primary white-dwarf spectrophotometric standard stars G191-B2B, GD 71, and GD 153. The sensitivity of an additional configuration was updated by comparing observations of the secondary standard BD +75 325 with the STIS low-resolution spectrum that has been calibrated consistently with the version 11 models. The procedures used to derive the sensitivities and verify the PHOTTAB reference files prior to their activation in CRDS (on May 1, 2025) are described. Results are presented in graphical form in an extensive appendix. Issues and uncertainties are discussed briefly, along with recommendations for future work.</description>

      <title>Agent Mars: Multi-Agent Simulation for Multi-Planetary Life Exploration and Settlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed robotics, healthcare, industry, and scientific discovery, yet a major frontier may lie beyond Earth. Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.</description>

      <title>Modeling Globular Cluster Stellar Streams with a Basis-Expansion N-body Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular cluster stellar streams probe galaxy-formation processes and can potentially reveal the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. In many theoretical studies, streams are modeled with particle-spray or direct N-body codes. But particle-spray methods abstract away the internal dynamics of the progenitor by making strong assumptions about the escape physics, while direct N-body is prohibitively expensive for realistic (N&gt;10^5) systems. In this paper, we present the stream-modeling capabilities of KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics, that bridges this runtime vs. accuracy gap. We show that KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models, and their associated streams, more accurately than particle spray in a fraction of the NBODY6++GPU wall-clock time. We then compare KRIOS to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams. The morphology and kinematics of these streams most disagree when the progenitor is tightly bound to the host, as these systems are often subject to stronger tidal forces. Finally, we discuss which elements of the progenitor physics are most important for modeling stellar streams and how these might be incorporated into particle-spray methods.</description>

Abstract: The four-spacecraft formation is essential for measurements of various physical fields. The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period. Suggested approach can significantly simplify planning missions for measurements of various interplanetary fields.</description>

      <title>MarsRetrieval: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Planetary-Scale Geospatial Retrieval on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches like deep learning are rapidly advancing planetary science, particularly in Mars exploration. Despite recent progress, most existing benchmarks remain confined to closed-set supervised visual tasks and do not support text-guided retrieval for geospatial discovery. We introduce MarsRetrieval, a retrieval benchmark for evaluating vision-language models for Martian geospatial discovery. MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models. Our evaluation shows MarsRetrieval is challenging: even strong foundation models often fail to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions. We further show that domain-specific fine-tuning is critical for generalizable geospatial discovery in planetary settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/MarsRetrieval</description>

      <title>Polarization fringes in optical systems: a compendium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral and spatial fringes in polarized light are produced by the interference of transmitted and reflected waves at the interface between materials with different indexes of refraction. These instrumental artifacts can affect the accuracy of optical designs conceived for high-sensitivity spectroscopy and polarimetry. We review the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for these artifacts and the possible design pathways that allow us to mitigate them. In order to do so, we also present an approximate treatment of the problem of the transmission and reflection of light through (possibly absorptive) birefringent layers, relying on a few fundamental results that can be found in the already extensive literature on the subject. Unfortunately, many of these results remain the domain of a niche of investigators working in the field of thin films and optical coatings, and are often overlooked even by experienced designers of spectro-polarimetric instrumentation. The treatment presented in this work is limited to isotropic materials and uniaxial crystals, which are the most common types of optics employed in polarimetric instrumentation, and it fundamentally relies on the approximation of small birefringence for its implementation. An extensive set of modeling examples is provided to highlight the salient characteristics of polarization fringes, as well as to assess how approximate treatments such as this compare to exact but more computational expensive formulations of the problem such as Berreman's calculus.</description>

Abstract: The excavation of the Hyper-Kamiokande cavern, 600 m underground, is complete. Measuring 69 m in diameter and 94 m in height, it is among the world's largest rock caverns. A vertically oriented, dome-capped cylindrical design was chosen to optimize cost and performance. Combined with substantial overburden, the geometry posed major engineering challenges. This paper outlines the underground works, main cavern design, excavation plan, and the evolution of support design and construction methods during excavation, namely the information-based (observational) design and construction approach.</description>

      <title>Geodetically Anchored 0.30m Digital Elevation Model of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram Landing Site from Chandrayaan-2 Orbital High Resolution Camera (OHRC) Stereo Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ISRO's terrain characterization and hazard mapping from Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) stereo imagery were central to the safe landing of Chandrayaan-3 - the first successful landing in the lunar south polar region. However, these elevation products were generated with a proprietary pipeline and have not been publicly released. We present a 0.30 m/pixel digital elevation model (DEM) of the Chandrayaan-3 Vikram landing site using a fully open workflow based on ISIS, the Ames Stereo Pipeline, and ALE, achieving sub-meter resolution comparable to mission-reported products.
  The reconstruction covers 2.18 x 2.24 km with 91.2% valid pixel coverage, 8.1 cm median triangulation error, and 40-50 cm relative vertical precision. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover are individually resolved. Geodetic alignment to an LROC NAC stereo DEM achieves approximately 30 m horizontal accuracy; pixel-wise validation at 3 m resolution confirms negligible vertical bias (median dz = +0.28 m) and robust dispersion (NMAD = 2.88 m). Stable OHRC stereo convergence requires Community Sensor Model (CSM) camera models; the legacy ISIS camera model failed across two independent sites.
  At 0.30 m, these DEMs complement LROC NAC DTMs (approximately 1 m), resolving sub-meter hazards below the NAC detection threshold. Applied to the extensive OHRC south polar archive, this methodology provides independent capability for hazard mapping and landing site analysis for upcoming missions including Chandrayaan-4, LUPEX, and Artemis.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Magnetic Sensitivity Measurements of Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>

Abstract: The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Integral Field Spectrograph--GEHONG: A Package for Generating Ideal Datacubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a Python package GEHONG to mock the three-dimensional spectral data cube under the observation of an ideal telescope for the Integral Field Spectrograph of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST-IFS). This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra. That makes GEHONG able to mock various types of targets, including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and HII regions.</description>

Abstract: Ginnungagap is a fully parallel (MPI+OpenMP) code designed to generate cosmological initial conditions for simulations involving very large numbers of particles. It operates in several modes, including the creation of initial conditions with either uniform or spatially varying resolution (for "zoom-in" simulations). The initial conditions can be fully random or derived by extending the resolution of existing ones while preserving the large-scale structures. Ginnungagap is open source and modular, consisting of a collection of independent tools that can be used for a variety of tasks. In this paper, we describe the main features of Ginnungagap and present test results for different types of simulations prepared with it.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown tremendous promise in solving problems in high energy physics, materials science, and fluid dynamics. In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Periodicities in radio emissions from the Jupiter's magnetosphere and consequences for radio emissions from star-exoplanet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for radio signals from exoplanets or star-planet interactions is a topic of major scientific interest, as it is likely the best way to detect and measure a planetary magnetic field and, therefore, to probe the inner structure of exoplanets. However, detecting these radio emissions is challenging, since they are anisotropic by nature, sporadic, and of low intensity because of their great distances, and because the sky cannot be monitored continuously. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the relevance of using statistical tools to detect periodic radio signals in unevenly spaced observations, and identify the implications of the measured period. The identification of periodic radio signals is achieved here by a Lomb-Scargle analysis. We first apply the technique to simulated astrophysical observations with controlled simulated noise. This allows us to characterize the origin of spurious detection peaks in the resulting periodograms, as well as to identify peaks corresponding to real periods in the studied system, and to harmonic or beat periods. We then validate this method with a real signal, using approximately 1400 hours of data from observations of Jupiter's radio emissions by the NenuFAR radio telescope over more than six years, to detect the periodicities of Jovian radio emissions (auroral and induced by the Galilean moons). We demonstrate with the simulation that the LombScargle periodogram allows us to correctly identify periodic radio signals, even in a diluted signal. On real measurements, it correctly detects the rotation period of the strong signal produced by Jupiter and the beat period of the emission triggered by the interaction between Jupiter and its Galilean moon Io, ...</description>

      <title>Comparative biosignatures with systemic retrievals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST can reveal biosignature gases, though current discoveries have yet to evidence life. The central challenge is attribution: how can we confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially given the stochastic abiotic processes that can set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we propose a comparative multi-planet approach centred on systemic retrievals: the analysis of multiple planets within a system to empirically define the `abiotic baseline'. This baseline, constructed from obligate uninhabited planets, serves as a local reference point. Systemic retrievals enable marginalisation over inaccessible, latent, shared abiotic parameters within planet evolution models. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, have been irradiated by the same evolving star, and have a linked dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally-informed abiotic planet evolution models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Potentially biological anomalies are identified as statistical outliers from the abiotic baseline using Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation. A comparative biosignature is thus defined: an anomaly where a biotic planetary evolution model provides a superior fit than its abiotic counterpart. Where both abiotic and biotic models yield poor predictive accuracy, the anomaly is flagged as an ``unknown unknown"; a signature of either unconstrained abiotic processes, or life as we don't yet know it.</description>

      <title>A normalizing flow approach for the inference of star cluster properties from unresolved broadband photometry I: Comparison to spectral energy distribution fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry is a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods suffer from computational limitations. In addition, nuisance parameters in the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable. These limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods that offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior distributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing flow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble Space Telescope broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our network's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous works. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic photometric observations for $5 \times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently, this data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability distributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric observations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the capabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available PHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We demonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the inference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially useful when nuisance parameters make the computation of the likelihood intractable and in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spatially-resolved capabilities of the J-PAS survey with Py2DJPAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Py2DJPAS, a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of spatially resolved galaxies in the \textbf{miniJPAS} survey, a 1~deg$^2$ precursor of the J-PAS survey, using the same filter system, telescope, and Pathfinder camera. Py2DJPAS streamlines the entire workflow: downloading scientific images and catalogs, performing PSF homogenization, masking, aperture definition, SED fitting, and estimating optical emission line equivalent widths via an artificial neural network.
  We validate Py2DJPAS on a sample of resolved miniJPAS galaxies, recovering magnitudes in all bands consistent with the catalog ($\sim 10$~\% precision using SExtractor). Local background estimation improves results for faint galaxies and apertures. PSF homogenization enables consistent multi-band photometry in inner apertures, allowing pseudo-spectra generation without artifacts. SED fitting across annular apertures yields residuals $&lt;10$~\%, with no significant wavelength-dependent bias for regions with $S/N&gt;5$.
  We demonstrate the IFU-like capability of J-PAS by analyzing the spatially resolved properties of galaxy 2470-10239 at $z = 0.078$, comparing them to MaNGA data within 1 half-light radius (HLR). We find excellent agreement in photometric vs. spectroscopic measurements and stellar mass surface density profiles. Our analysis extends to 4 HLR (S/N~$\sim$~5), showing that J-PAS can probe galaxy outskirts, enabling the study of evolutionary processes at large galactocentric distances.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: A symbolic-numeric, approximation-free, and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package for solving the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations in cosmology. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes, and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well to extended models, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler provides their equations, and SymBoltz solves them while reducing friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages (e.g., background and perturbations), generating analytical and sparse Jacobian matrices, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains comparable to existing approximation-based codes due to efficient high-order implicit methods, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian, and sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in large parameter spaces, Fisher forecasting, emulator training, and sensitivity analyses. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Output spectra agree with established codes up to 0.1% with standard precision levels. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is publicly available with single-command installation and extensive documentation. We welcome all contributions to the code from the community.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For a folded loop with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Indirect forces in disc-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Simple Power Law: A Bayesian Analysis of 897 Pulsar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of pulsar radio spectra using the largest curated dataset of calibrated flux densities to date, comprising 897 pulsars, and employing a robust Bayesian framework for model comparison alongside frequentist methods. Contrary to the established consensus that pulsar spectra are predominantly simple power laws, our analysis reveals that complex spectral shapes with curvature or breaks are in fact the norm. The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\%, with 68.8\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models. We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature. A key finding is that the previously reported dominance of the simple power law was largely a statistical artifact of the frequentist method used in earlier work. These findings substantially revise the prevailing view of pulsar spectra and establish a critical, model-classified foundation for future theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and phase-resolved polarimetry of millisecond pulsars and its application to timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing is used for a variety of applications including tests of fundamental physics, probing the structure of neutron stars, and detecting nanohertz gravitational waves. Development of robust methods and generation of high-quality timing data is therefore of utmost importance. In this paper, we present a new technique for creating high-fidelity templates that can be used to measure the pulse times of arrival with significantly increased precision compared to existing methods. Our framework makes use of all available polarimetric information to generate frequency-dependent models of pulse-shape evolution of all four Stokes parameters. We apply this method to millisecond pulsars observed by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and show that it results in timing measurement uncertainties reduced up to $\sim$20-30%. We also present, for the first time, phase- and frequency-resolved polarimetric measurements of millisecond pulsars observed with the Parkes Murriyang ultra-widebandwith-low receiver. The data, plots and the code underlying this analysis are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Linearized Approach to Radial-Velocity Extraction. II: Shot-Noise-Limited Precision via Spectral Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) formalism for radial velocity extraction to cases where the underlying spectral components are unknown. The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of ~30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to ~50 cm/s with $\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Anisotropies in PTA Observations: Analytical Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice or water. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Imaging Venus-like Worlds: Spectral, Polarimetric, and UV Diagnostics for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $\mu$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\gtrsim$1.5 $\mu$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.</description>

      <title>The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z &lt; 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} &lt; 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.</description>

      <title>NovaMoon: A Strategic Lunar Reference Station for Positioning, Timing, and Largely Enhanced Science in the Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</description>
