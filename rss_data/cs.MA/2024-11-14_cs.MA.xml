      <title>On the Application of Model Predictive Control to a Weighted Coverage Path Planning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a weighted coverage path planning (WCPP) problem. The problem appears in a wide range of practical applications, such as search and rescue (SAR) missions. The basic setup is that one (or multiple) agents can move around a given search space and collect rewards from a given spatial distribution. Unlike an artificial potential field, each reward can only be collected once. In contrast to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the agent moves in a continuous space. Moreover, he is not obliged to cover all locations and/or may return to previously visited locations. The WCPP problem is tackled by a new Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation with so-called Coverage Constraints (CCs). It is shown that the solution becomes more effective if the solver is initialized with a TSP-based heuristic. With and without this initialization, the proposed MPC approach clearly outperforms a naive MPC formulation, as demonstrated in a small simulation study.</description>

      <title>Online Dynamic Pricing for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations with Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs), coupled with the rise of renewable energy sources, will significantly impact the electric grid. Unlike conventional fuel sources, electricity for EVs is constrained by grid capacity, price fluctuations, and long EV charging times, requiring new pricing solutions to manage demand and supply. This paper proposes a model for online dynamic pricing of reserved EV charging services, including reservation, parking, and charging as a bundled service priced as a whole. Our approach focuses on the individual charging station operator, employing a stochastic demand model and online dynamic pricing based on expected demand. The proposed model uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation to optimize sequential pricing decisions for charging session requests. A key contribution is the novel definition and quantification of discretization error introduced by the discretization of the Poisson process for use in the MDP. The model's viability is demonstrated with a heuristic solution method based on Monte-Carlo tree search, offering a viable path for real-world application.</description>
