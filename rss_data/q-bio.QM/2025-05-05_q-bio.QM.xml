      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Essential Workers at Risk: An Agent-Based Model (SAFE-ABM) with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Essential workers face elevated infection risks due to their critical roles during pandemics, and protecting them remains a significant challenge for public health planning. This study develops SAFE-ABM, a simulation-based framework using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), to evaluate targeted intervention strategies, explicitly capturing structured interactions across families, workplaces, and schools. We simulate key scenarios such as unrestricted movement, school closures, mobility restrictions specific to essential workers, and workforce rotation, to assess their impact on disease transmission dynamics. To ensure robust uncertainty assessment, we integrate a novel Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) framework, systematically capturing variability in transmission rates, recovery times, and mortality estimates. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that while general mobility restrictions reduce overall transmission, a workforce rotation strategy for essential workers, when combined with quarantine enforcement, most effectively limits workplace outbreaks and secondary family infections. Unlike other interventions, this approach preserves a portion of the susceptible population, resulting in a more controlled and sustainable epidemic trajectory. These findings offer critical insights for optimizing intervention strategies that mitigate disease spread while maintaining essential societal functions.</description>

      <title>Digital Pathway Curation (DPC): a comparative pipeline to assess the reproducibility, consensus and accuracy across Gemini, PubMed, and scientific reviewers in biomedical research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scientific study begins with a central question, and search engines like PubMed are the first tools for retrieving knowledge and understanding the current state of the art. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in research, promising acceleration and deeper results. However, besides caution, they demand rigorous validation. Assessing complex biological relationships remains challenging for SQL-based tools and LLM models. Here, we introduce the Digital Pathway Curation (DPC) pipeline to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the Gemini models against PubMed search and human expert curation. Using two omics experiments, we created a large dataset (Ensemble) based on determining pathway-disease associations. With the Ensemble dataset, we demonstrate that Gemini achieves high run-to-run reproducibility of approximately 99% and inter-model reproducibility of around 75%. Next, we calculate the crowdsourced consensus using a smaller dataset. The CSC allows us to calculate accuracies, and the Gemini multi-model consensus reached a significant accuracy of about 87%. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are reproducible, reliable, and valuable tools for navigating complex biomedical knowledge.</description>

      <title>Cardiovascular function changes following lung resection: a computational model to compare afterload increase and contractility loss mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional limitation after lung resection surgery has been consistently documented in clinical studies, and right ventricle (RV) dysfunction has been hypothesized as a contributing reason. However, the mechanisms of RV dysfunction after lung resection remain unclear, particularly whether change in afterload or contractility is the main cause. This study is the first to employ a lumped parameter model to simulate the effects of lung resection. The implementation of a computational model allowed us to isolate certain mechanisms that are difficult to perform clinically. Specifically, two mechanisms were compared: afterload increase and RV contractility loss. Furthermore, our rigorous approach included local and global sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of parameters on our results, both individually and collectively. Our results demonstrate that contractility and afterload exhibited consistent trends across various pressure and volume conditions, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and right ventricular systolic pressure showed opposite variations. The results show that post-operative RV dysfunction may result from a combination of RV contractility loss and afterload increase. Further exploration and refinement of this first computational model presented herein will help us predict RV dysfunction after lung resection and pave the way towards improving outcomes for lung cancer patients.</description>

      <title>Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Proteins (SAGE-Prot): A Framework for Multi-Objective Protein Optimization via Iterative Sequence Generation and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins play essential roles in nature, from catalyzing biochemical reactions to binding specific targets. Advances in protein engineering have the potential to revolutionize biotechnology and healthcare by designing proteins with tailored properties. Machine learning and generative models have transformed protein design by enabling the exploration of vast sequence-function landscapes. Here, we introduce Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Proteins (SAGE-Prot), a framework that iteratively combines autoregressive protein generation with quantitative structure-property relationship models for fine-tuned optimization. By integrating diverse protein descriptors, SAGE-Prot enhances key properties, including binding affinity, thermal stability, enzymatic activity, and solubility. We demonstrate its effectiveness by optimizing GB1 for binding affinity and thermal stability and TEM-1 for enzymatic activity and solubility. Leveraging curriculum learning, SAGE-Prot adapts rapidly to increasingly complex design objectives, building on past successes. Experimental validation demonstrated that SAGE-Prot-generated proteins substantially outperformed their wild-type counterparts, achieving up to a 17-fold increase in beta-lactamase activity, underscoring SAGE-Prot's potential to tackle critical challenges in protein engineering. As generative models continue to evolve, approaches like SAGE-Prot will be indispensable for advancing rational protein design.</description>
