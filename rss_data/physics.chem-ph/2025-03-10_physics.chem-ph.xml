      <title>Complex potential energy surfaces: gradients with projected CAP technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique is one of the commonly used Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approaches for characterizing electronic resonances. CAP combined with various electronic structure methods has shown promising results in quantifying the energies and widths of electronic resonances in molecular systems. While CAP-based methods can be used to map complex potential energy surfaces for resonance states, efficient exploration of these surfaces, e.g. geometry optimization or dynamical simulations, require information on the nuclear gradient. Currently, the only nuclear gradients available for CAP-based methods are for Hartree-Fock and Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster method with single and double excitations (J. Chem. Phys. 146, 031101 (2017)). Here we provide a general approach that relies on projected CAP formulation and extends gradients and non-adiabatic couplings formulations developed for bound-state electronic structure methods to resonances. The approach is not limited to a specific electron structure method and is generally applicable to any electronic structure methods, provided the information on the gradients and non-adiabatic couplings is available for bound states. Here, we focus on the State-Averaged Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (SA-CASSCF) and Multi-Reference Configurational Interaction with Single excitation (MR-CIS) as our methods of choice. We establish the accuracy of the developed gradients and report equilibrium geometries for several representative temporary anion species ($\mathrm{N_2^-}$, $\mathrm{H_2CO^-}$, $\mathrm{H_2CO_2^-}$ and $\mathrm{C_2H_4^-}$).</description>

      <title>Understanding the core limitations of second-order correlation-based functionals through: functional, orbital, and eigenvalue-driven analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory has long struggled to obtain the exact exchange-correlational (XC) functional. Numerous approximations have been designed with the hope of achieving chemical accuracy. However, designing a functional involves numerous methodologies, which has a greater possibility for error accumulation if the functionals are poorly formulated. This study aims to investigate the performance and limitations of second-order correlation functionals within the framework of density functional theory. Specifically, we focus on three major classes of density functional approximations that incorporate second-order energy expressions: \textit{ab initio} (primarily G\"{o}rling-Levy) functionals, adiabatic connection models, and double-hybrid functionals. The principal objectives of this research are to evaluate the accuracy of second-order correlation functionals, to understand how the choice of reference orbitals and eigenvalues affects the performance of these functionals, to identify the intrinsic limitations of second-order energy expressions, especially when using arbitrary orbitals or non-canonical configurations, and propose strategies for improving their accuracy. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide deeper insights into the factors governing the accuracy of second-order correlation functionals, thereby guiding future functional development.</description>

      <title>An electrical molecular motor driven by angular momentum transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of unidirectional motion has been a long-standing challenge in engineering of molecular motors and, more generally, machines. A molecular motor is characterized by a set of low energy states that differ in their configuration, i.e. position or rotation. In biology and Feringa-type motors, unidirectional motion is driven by excitation of the molecule into a high-energy transitional state followed by a directional relaxation back to a low-energy state. Directionality is created by a steric hindrance for movement along one of the directions on the path from the excited state back to a low energy state. Here, we showcase a principle mechanism for the generation of unidirectional rotation of a molecule without the need of steric hindrance and transitional excited states. The chemical design of the molecule consisting of a platform, upright axle and chiral rotor moiety enables a rotation mechanism that relies on the transfer of orbital angular momentum from the driving current to the rotor. The transfer is mediated via orbital currents that are carried by helical orbitals in the axle.</description>

      <title>Free energy profiles for chemical reactions in solution from high-dimensional neural network potentials: The case of the Strecker synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become a popular tool in chemistry and materials science as they combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the high computational efficiency of analytic potentials. MLPs are particularly useful for computationally demanding simulations such as the determination of free energy profiles governing chemical reactions in solution, but to date such applications are still rare. In this work we show how umbrella sampling simulations can be combined with active learning of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) to construct free energy profiles in a systematic way. For the example of the first step of Strecker synthesis of glycine in aqueous solution we provide a detailed analysis of the improving quality of HDNNPs for datasets of increasing size. We find that next to the typical quantification of energy and force errors with respect to the underlying density functional theory data also the long-term stability of the simulations and the convergence of physical properties should be rigorously monitored to obtain reliable and converged free energy profiles of chemical reactions in solution.</description>

      <title>Giant mobility of surface-trapped ionic charges following liquid tribocharging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrophobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to stem from ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a new state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport and electrified matter at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar infrared emission bands (AIBs). However, current spectral databases for AIB analysis face limitations because of the neglect of anharmonicity in vibrations and of temperature effects, which result from the high computational cost of traditional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic infrared (IR) spectra while accounting for temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We apply MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1\,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its ability to handle large molecular systems. Our results suggest that MLMD can facilitate the creation of extensive molecular spectral databases, advancing AI-assisted analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly with upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Revealing localised dark-exciton populations in 2D perovskites via magneto-optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The successful development of optoelectronic devices is contingent on a detailed understanding of interactions between light and excited energy states in photoactive materials. In 2D perovskites, excitons are the dominant photogenerated species and their energetic structure plays a pivotal role, governing photon absorption and emission processes. In these materials, dark exciton states can undergo photoluminescence due to the relaxation of selection rules and this process can be modulated by an external magnetic field, enabling unambiguous identification of the exciton fine structure. Previous reports of magneto-optical spectroscopy on 2D perovskites have been restricted to the macroscopic response, where key information is lost regarding the microscopic heterogeneity of the photoluminescence. Here, we use magneto-optical microscopy for the first time on perovskite materials to elucidate the spatial variation of exciton emission processes. In 2D perovskite thin films, we distinguish between regions of localised bright and dark exciton populations, correlated to the film morphology. In single crystals, we show that dark excitons become localised at the edges, where excitons can be trapped in two distinct types of sub-gap states. This work represents significant progress in understanding the properties of exciton emission in 2D perovskites, which is crucial for the development of optoelectronic technology.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-electronic calculations need uncontracted basis sets on the quantum protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attractive way to calculate nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr\"odinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei. This is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, but it also has many other names. Two types of basis sets are required: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set. In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on the quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis set limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton affinities employing double-$\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\zeta$ aug-pc-2 electronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational effort. The partially uncontracted aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords proton affinities converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol from the complete basis set limit. Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP basis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence. As the protonic basis sets yield fully converged values, we find the protonic basis sets to be unnecessarily large for ground state density functional calculations, as the error in the protonic basis set is not balanced with that for typical electronic basis sets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

Abstract: A recent article by Ivander, Lindoy and Lee [Nature Communications 15, 8087 (2024)] claims to discover the relationship between the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the path integral for a system coupled to a harmonic bath. However, this relationship was already established in 2020 by Makri in the context of the small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) [J. Chem. Theory and Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. The procedure that this article uses in its Supplementary Information (SI) to obtain the various matrices follows the SMatPI decomposition steps for the alternative Trotter ordering. The absence of endpoint effects in the kernel matrices of the discretized GQME expression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) is the consequence of a crude GQME discretization and is not consistent with the SMatPI decomposition of an auxiliary matrix presented in the SI. This form is identical to the transfer tensor method (TTM) of Cerrillo and Cao [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 110401 (2014)]. Further, the Dyck path section of this article follows precisely the diagrammatic analysis developed by Wang and Cai in a recent paper [Communications in Computational Physics 36, 389 (2024)]. We elaborate on these three critiques in this Comment.</description>
