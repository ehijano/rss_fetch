      <title>Modelling the High-Voltage Grid Using Open Data for Europe and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the background, methodology and validation for constructing a representation of the European high-voltage grid, including and above 200 kV, based on public data provided by OpenStreetMap. The model-independent grid dataset is published under the Open Data Commons Open Database (ODbL 1.0) licence and can be used for large-scale electricity as well as energy system modelling. The dataset and workflow are provided as part of PyPSA-Eur -- an open-source, sector-coupled optimisation model of the European energy system. By integrating with the codebase for initiatives such as PyPSA-Earth, the value of open and maintainable high-voltage grid data extends to the global context. By accessing the latest data through the the Overpass turbo API, the dataset can be easily reconstructed and updated within minutes. To assess the data quality, this paper further compares the dataset with official statistics and representative model runs using PyPSA-Eur based on different electricity grid representations.</description>

      <title>Exaptation: Academic mentees' career pathway to be independent and impactful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In science, mentees often follow their mentors' career paths, but exceptional mentees frequently break from this routine, sometimes even outperforming their mentors. However, the pathways to independence for these excellent mentees and their interactions with mentors remain unclear. We analyzed the careers of over 500,000 mentees in Chemistry, Neuroscience, and Physics over the past 60 years to examine the strategies mentees employ in selecting research topics relative to their mentors, how these strategies evolve, and their resulting impact. Utilizing co-citation network analysis and a topic-specific impact allocation algorithm, we mapped the topic territory for each mentor-mentee pair and quantified their academic impact accrued within the topic. Our findings reveal mentees tend to engage with their mentors' less-dominated topics and explore new topics at the same time, and through this exaptive process, they begin to progressively establish their own research territories. This trend is particularly pronounced among those who outperform their mentors. Moreover, we identified an inverted U-shaped curve between the extent of topic divergence and the mentees' long-term impact, suggesting a moderate divergence from the mentors' research focus optimizes the mentees' academic impact. Finally, along the path to independence, increased coauthorship with mentors impedes the mentees' impact, whereas extending their collaboration networks with the mentors' former collaborators proves beneficial. These findings fill a crucial gap in understanding how mentees' research topic selection strategies affect academic success and offer valuable guidance for early-career researchers on pursuing independent research paths.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of probabilistic contact tracing in epidemic containment: the role of super-spreaders and transmission path reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent COVID-19 pandemic underscores the significance of early-stage non-pharmacological intervention strategies. The widespread use of masks and the systematic implementation of contact tracing strategies provide a potentially equally effective and socially less impactful alternative to more conventional approaches, such as large-scale mobility restrictions. However, manual contact tracing faces strong limitations in accessing the network of contacts, and the scalability of currently implemented protocols for smartphone-based digital contact tracing becomes impractical during the rapid expansion phases of the outbreaks, due to the surge in exposure notifications and associated tests. A substantial improvement in digital contact tracing can be obtained through the integration of probabilistic techniques for risk assessment that can more effectively guide the allocation of new diagnostic tests. In this study, we first quantitatively analyze the diagnostic and social costs associated with these containment measures based on contact tracing, employing three state-of-the-art models of SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Our results suggest that probabilistic techniques allow for more effective mitigation at a lower cost. Secondly, our findings reveal a remarkable efficacy of probabilistic contact-tracing techniques in performing backward and multi-step tracing and capturing super-spreading events.</description>
