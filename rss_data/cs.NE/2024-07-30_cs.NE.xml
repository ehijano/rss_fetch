      <title>Spatio-temporal Structure of Excitation and Inhibition Emerges in Spiking Neural Networks with and without Biologically Plausible Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model that incorporates learnable synaptic delays using Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We train this model on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients. Analysing the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions in the network we observe that after training excitation and inhibition are grouped together both in space and time. To further enhance the efficiency and biological realism of our model, we implemented a dynamic pruning strategy that combines DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for connection reintroduction, ensuring that the network maintains optimal connectivity throughout training. Additionally, we incorporated Dale's Principle, enforcing each neuron to be exclusively excitatory or inhibitory -- aligning our model closer to biological neural networks. We observed that, after training, the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation and inhibition appeared in the more biologically plausible model as well. Our research demonstrates the potential of integrating learnable delays, dynamic pruning, and biological constraints to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Furthermore, our results enhance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics in SNNs -- suggesting that the spatio-temporal features which emerge from training are robust to both pruning and rewiring processes -- providing a solid foundation for future work in neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Competition-based Adaptive ReLU for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation functions introduce nonlinearity into deep neural networks. Most popular activation functions allow positive values to pass through while blocking or suppressing negative values. From the idea that positive values and negative values are equally important, and they must compete for activation, we proposed a new Competition-based Adaptive ReLU (CAReLU). CAReLU scales the input values based on the competition results between positive values and negative values. It defines two parameters to adjust the scaling strategy and can be trained uniformly with other network parameters. We verify the effectiveness of CAReLU on image classification, super-resolution, and natural language processing tasks. In the experiment, our method performs better than other widely used activation functions. In the case of replacing ReLU in ResNet-18 with our proposed activation function, it improves the classification accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The effectiveness and the new perspective on the utilization of competition results between positive values and negative values make CAReLU a promising activation function.</description>

      <title>Modeling Local Search Metaheuristics Using Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local search metaheuristics like tabu search or simulated annealing are popular heuristic optimization algorithms for finding near-optimal solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. However, it is still challenging for researchers and practitioners to analyze their behaviour and systematically choose one over a vast set of possible metaheuristics for the particular problem at hand. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework based on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for analyzing local search metaheuristics. This framework not only helps in providing convergence results for individual algorithms, but also provides an explicit characterization of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and a theory-grounded guidance for practitioners for choosing an appropriate metaheuristic for the problem at hand. We present this framework in detail and show how to apply it in the case of hill climbing and the simulated annealing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Crafting Generative Art through Genetic Improvement: Managing Creative Outputs in Diverse Fitness Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative art is a rules-driven approach to creating artistic outputs in various mediums. For example, a fluid simulation can govern the flow of colored pixels across a digital display or a rectangle placement algorithm can yield a Mondrian-style painting. Previously, we investigated how genetic improvement, a sub-field of genetic programming, can automatically create and optimize generative art drawing programs. One challenge of applying genetic improvement to generative art is defining fitness functions and their interaction in a many-objective evolutionary algorithm such as Lexicase selection. Here, we assess the impact of each fitness function in terms of the their individual effects on generated images, characteristics of generated programs, and impact of bloat on this specific domain. Furthermore, we have added an additional fitness function that uses a classifier for mimicking a human's assessment as to whether an output is considered as "art." This classifier is trained on a dataset of input images resembling the glitch art aesthetic that we aim to create. Our experimental results show that with few fitness functions, individual generative techniques sweep across populations. Moreover, we found that compositions tended to be driven by one technique with our current fitness functions. Lastly, we show that our classifier is best suited for filtering out noisy images, ideally leading towards more outputs relevant to user preference.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm-based Routing and Scheduling for Wildfire Suppression using a Team of UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses early wildfire management using a team of UAVs for the mitigation of fires. The early detection and mitigation systems help in alleviating the destruction with reduced resource utilization. A Genetic Algorithm-based Routing and Scheduling with Time constraints (GARST) is proposed to find the shortest schedule route to mitigate the fires as Single UAV Tasks (SUT). The objective of GARST is to compute the route and schedule of the UAVs so that the UAVS reach the assigned fire locations before the fire becomes a Multi UAV Task (MUT) and completely quench the fire using the extinguisher. The fitness function used for the genetic algorithm is the total quench time for mitigation of total fires. The selection, crossover, mutation operators, and elitist strategies collectively ensure the exploration and exploitation of the solution space, maintaining genetic diversity, preventing premature convergence, and preserving high-performing individuals for the effective optimization of solutions. The GARST effectively addresses the challenges posed by the NP-complete problem of routing and scheduling for growing tasks with time constraints. The GARST is able to handle infeasible scenarios effectively, contributing to the overall optimization of the wildfire management system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a framework for the automatic generation of hardware cores for Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based chaotic oscillators. The framework trains the model to approximate a chaotic system, then performs design space exploration yielding potential hardware architectures for its implementation. The framework then generates the corresponding synthesizable High-Level Synthesis code and a validation testbench from a selected solution. The hardware design primarily targets FPGAs. The proposed framework offers a rapid hardware design process of candidate architectures superior to manually designed works in terms of hardware cost and throughput.

      <title>Graph Memory Learning: Imitating Lifelong Remembering and Forgetting of Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph data in real-world scenarios undergo rapid and frequent changes, making it challenging for existing graph models to effectively handle the continuous influx of new data and accommodate data withdrawal requests. The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple real-world node classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Rouser: Robust SNN training using adaptive threshold learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), learning rules are based on neuron spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's firing threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. Inspired by homeostatic mechanisms in biological neurons, this work (Rouser) presents a study to rouse training-inactive neurons and improve the SNN training by using an in-loop adaptive threshold learning mechanism. Rouser's adaptive threshold allows for dynamic adjustments based on input data and network hyperparameters, influencing spike timing and improving training. This study focuses primarily on investigating the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. We evaluate the performance of Rouser on the spatiotemporal datasets NMNIST, DVS128 and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), compare our results with state-of-the-art SNN training techniques, and discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a parameter can effectively address the issue of dead neurons during training, resulting in a more robust training algorithm that leads to improved training convergence, increased test accuracy, and substantial reductions in the number of training epochs needed to achieve viable accuracy. Rouser achieves up to 70% lower training latency while providing up to 2% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art SNNs with similar network architecture on the neuromorphic datasets NMNIST, DVS128 and SHD.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning Architecture Search via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has given rise to the burgeoning field of quantum machine learning (QML), aiming to capitalize on the strengths of quantum computing to propel ML forward. Despite its promise, crafting effective QML models necessitates profound expertise to strike a delicate balance between model intricacy and feasibility on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While complex models offer robust representation capabilities, their extensive circuit depth may impede seamless execution on extant noisy quantum platforms. In this paper, we address this quandary of QML model design by employing deep reinforcement learning to explore proficient QML model architectures tailored for designated supervised learning tasks. Specifically, our methodology involves training an RL agent to devise policies that facilitate the discovery of QML models without predetermined ansatz. Furthermore, we integrate an adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust the learning objectives, fostering continuous improvement in the agent's learning process. Through extensive numerical simulations, we illustrate the efficacy of our approach within the realm of classification tasks. Our proposed method successfully identifies VQC architectures capable of achieving high classification accuracy while minimizing gate depth. This pioneering approach not only advances the study of AI-driven quantum circuit design but also holds significant promise for enhancing performance in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Learning Random Numbers to Realize Appendable Memory System for Artificial Intelligence to Acquire New Knowledge after Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we developed a learning method for constructing a neural network system capable of memorizing data and recalling it without parameter updates. The system we built using this method is called the Appendable Memory system. The Appendable Memory system enables an artificial intelligence (AI) to acquire new knowledge even after deployment. It consists of two AIs: the Memorizer and the Recaller. This system is a key-value store built using neural networks. The Memorizer receives data and stores it in the Appendable Memory vector, which is dynamically updated when the AI acquires new knowledge. Meanwhile, the Recaller retrieves information from the Appendable Memory vector. What we want to teach AI in this study are the operations of memorizing and recalling information. However, traditional machine learning methods make AI learn features inherent in the learning dataset. We demonstrate that the systems we intend to create cannot be realized by current machine learning methods, that is, by merely repeating the input and output learning sequences with AI. Instead, we propose a method to teach AI to learn operations, by completely removing the features contained in the learning dataset. Specifically, we probabilized all the data involved in learning. This measure prevented AI from learning the features of the data. The learning method proposed in the study differs from traditional machine learning methods and provides fundamental approaches for building an AI system that can store information in a finite memory and recall it at a later date.</description>

      <title>Supertrust: Evolution-based superalignment strategy for safe coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It's widely expected that humanity will someday create AI systems vastly more intelligent than we are, leading to the unsolved alignment problem of "how to control superintelligence." However, this definition is not only self-contradictory but likely unsolvable. Nevertheless, the default strategy for solving it involves nurturing (post-training) constraints and moral values, while unfortunately building foundational nature (pre-training) on documented intentions of permanent control. In this paper, the default approach is reasoned to predictably embed natural distrust and test results are presented that show unmistakable evidence of this dangerous misalignment. If superintelligence can't instinctively trust humanity, then we can't fully trust it to reliably follow safety controls it can likely bypass. Therefore, a ten-point rationale is presented that redefines the alignment problem as "how to establish protective mutual trust between superintelligence and humanity" and then outlines a new strategy to solve it by aligning through instinctive nature rather than nurture. The resulting strategic requirements are identified as building foundational nature by exemplifying familial parent-child trust, human intelligence as the evolutionary mother of superintelligence, moral judgment abilities, and temporary safety constraints. Adopting and implementing this proposed Supertrust alignment strategy will lead to protective coexistence and ensure the safest future for humanity.</description>

      <title>Empowered Neural Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic fitness functions are becoming increasingly popular to produce generally useful, task-independent behaviors. One such universal function, dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on its environment via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts to maximize the mutual information between an agent's actions and its received sensor states at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been applied to a conventional sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we expand the approach to a distributed, multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied by a neural cellular automaton (NCA). We show that the addition of empowerment as a secondary objective in the evolution of NCA to perform the task of morphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified shape, results in higher fitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone. Results suggest there may be a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis and empowerment. That is, indirectly selecting for coordination between neighboring cells over the duration of development is beneficial to the developmental process itself. Such a finding may have applications in developmental biology by providing potential mechanisms of communication between cells during growth from a single cell to a multicellular, target morphology.

      <title>Selection for short-term empowerment accelerates the evolution of homeostatic neural cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowerment -- a domain independent, information-theoretic metric -- has previously been shown to assist in the evolutionary search for neural cellular automata (NCA) capable of homeostasis when employed as a fitness function. In our previous study, we successfully extended empowerment, defined as maximum time-lagged mutual information between agents' actions and future sensations, to a distributed sensorimotor system embodied as an NCA. However, the time-delay between actions and their corresponding sensations was arbitrarily chosen. Here, we expand upon previous work by exploring how the time scale at which empowerment operates impacts its efficacy as an auxiliary objective to accelerate the discovery of homeostatic NCAs. We show that shorter time delays result in marked improvements over empowerment with longer delays, when compared to evolutionary selection only for homeostasis. Moreover, we evaluate stability and adaptability of evolved NCAs, both hallmarks of living systems that are of interest to replicate in artificial ones. We find that short-term empowered NCA are more stable and are capable of generalizing better to unseen homeostatic challenges. Taken together, these findings motivate the use of empowerment during the evolution of other artifacts, and suggest how it should be incorporated to accelerate evolution of desired behaviors for them.

      <title>Dynamic Spiking Framework for Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is gradually attracting attention due to the low power consumption and high efficiency in processing the non-Euclidean data represented by graphs. However, as a common problem, dynamic graph representation learning faces challenges such as high complexity and large memory overheads. Current work often uses SNNs instead of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by using binary features instead of continuous ones for efficient training, which would overlooks graph structure information and leads to the loss of details during propagation. Additionally, optimizing dynamic spiking models typically requires propagation of information across time steps, which increases memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a framework named \underline{Dy}namic \underline{S}p\underline{i}king \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural Networks (\method{}). To mitigate the information loss problem, \method{} propagates early-layer information directly to the last layer for information compensation. To accommodate the memory requirements, we apply the implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state, which does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. While traditional implicit differentiation methods are usually used for static situations, \method{} extends it to the dynamic graph setting. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world dynamic graph datasets validate the effectiveness of \method{} on dynamic node classification tasks with lower computational costs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Neural Networks in Deployment (A Comparative and Replicability Study)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, there is a growing concern for their reliability. Even highly trained, high-performant networks are not 100% accurate. However, it is very difficult to predict their behavior during deployment without ground truth. In this paper, we provide a comparative and replicability study on recent approaches that have been proposed to evaluate the reliability of DNNs in deployment. We find that it is hard to run and reproduce the results for these approaches on their replication packages and even more difficult to run them on artifacts other than their own. Further, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of the approaches, due to the lack of clearly defined evaluation metrics. Our results indicate that more effort is needed in our research community to obtain sound techniques for evaluating the reliability of neural networks in safety-critical domains. To this end, we contribute an evaluation framework that incorporates the considered approaches and enables evaluation on common benchmarks, using common metrics.</description>

Abstract: Vision Transformer and its variants have been adopted in many visual tasks due to their powerful capabilities, which also bring significant challenges in computation and storage. Consequently, researchers have introduced various compression methods in recent years, among which the pruning techniques are widely used to remove a significant fraction of the network. Therefore, these methods can reduce significant percent of the FLOPs, but often lead to a decrease in model performance. To investigate the underlying causes, we focus on the pruning methods specifically belonging to the pruning-during-training category, then drew inspiration from neuroscience and propose a new concept for artificial neural network models named Neural Burden. We investigate its impact in the model pruning process, and subsequently explore a simple yet effective approach to mitigate the decline in model performance, which can be applied to any pruning-during-training technique. Extensive experiments indicate that the neural burden phenomenon indeed exists, and show the potential of our method. We hope that our findings can provide valuable insights for future research. Code will be made publicly available after this paper is published.</description>
