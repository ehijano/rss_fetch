      <title>The entropy of radiation for local quenches in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real time dynamics of the radiation produced by a local quench in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with $d&gt;2$. Using the interpretation of the higher-dimensional twist operator as a conformal defect, we study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy of the radiation across a spherical entangling surface. We provide an analytic estimate for the early- and late-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and derive an upper bound valid at all times. We extend our analysis to the case of a boundary CFT (BCFT) and derive similar results through a detailed discussion of the setup with two conformal defects (the boundary and the twist operator). We conclude with a holographic analysis of the process, computing the time evolution of the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) as the area of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in a backreacted geometry. This gives a Page-like curve in agreement with the early- and late-time results obtained with CFT methods. The extension to a holographic BCFT setup is generically hard and we consider the case of a tensionless end-of-the-world brane.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Physics from Asymptotic Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dilaton is investigated from first principles in an asymptotically free Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory in three dimensions. In the limit of many fermion flavours, the theory features a finite line of strongly interacting fixed points with continuous quantum phase transitions and a massless Goldstone boson, the dilaton, following spontaneous scale symmetry breaking at its endpoint. Interestingly, we find that the emergence of a vacuum expectation value and a dilaton can be understood as a double-scaling limit. Exploiting the scalar two-point function, we identify the dilaton in the spectrum, compute its decay constant, and obtain universal expressions for the induced dilaton mass in terms of small perturbations. Consistency of findings with soft dilaton theorems is equally established. Implications for spontaneously broken conformal theories are indicated.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Domain Walls in Supersymmetric Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories (SYM) tension-degenerate domain walls are typical. Adding matter fields in fundamental representation we arrive at supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) supporting similar walls. We demonstrate that the degenerate domain walls can belong to one of two classes: (i) locally distinguishable, i.e. those which differ from each other locally (which could be detected in local measurements); and (ii) those which have identical local structure and are differentiated only topologically, through a judicially chosen compactification of $\mathbb{R}^4$. Depending on the number of flavors $F$ and the pattern of Higgsing both classes can coexists among SQCD $k$ walls interpolating between the vacua $n$ and $n+k$. We prove that the overall multiplicity of the domain walls obtained after accounting for both classes is $\nu_{N,k}^\text{walls}= N!/\big[(N-k)!k!\big]$, as was discovered previously in limiting cases. (Here $N$ is the number of colors.) Thus, $\nu_{N,k}^\text{walls}$ is a peculiar index. For the locally distinguishable degenerate domain walls we observe two-wall junctions, a phenomenon specific for supersymmetry with central extensions. This phenomenon does not exist for topological replicas.</description>

      <title>S-duality in higher-derivative corrections of heterotic supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, we observed that the consistency of heterotic supergravity, where the $B$-field gauge transformation is anomalous due to the Green-Schwarz mechanism, requires an infinite tower of higher-derivative couplings with exact genus $e^{-2\Phi}$ to maintain T-duality. In this paper, we utilize S-duality in heterotic/type I string theory to demonstrate that this series produces an expansion in terms of $\alpha'$ and genus in type I theory. The couplings at the derivative order $\alpha'^n$ exhibit a genus of $e^{(n+k-2)\Phi}$ in type I theory, where $k$ represents half the number of Yang-Mills field strengths. Our study reveals that standard S-duality transformations do not receive higher-derivative corrections, and field redefinitions in heterotic theory generally do not transform under S-duality to the field redefinitions in type I theory, and vice versa. Leveraging these insights, we derive the explicit form of the effective action for type I theory at the $\alpha'$ order within a scheme devoid of dilaton derivatives.
  Additionally, we examine the S-duality of heterotic theory on $T^4$ and type IIA theory on $K3$ to investigate the sphere-level NS-NS couplings at order $\alpha'^3$, recently identified through T-duality. This duality relates the torus-level effective action of the heterotic theory at order $\alpha'$, which is zero, to the sphere-level effective action of type IIA on $K3$ at the same order. We demonstrate that the $K3$-reduction of the sphere-level NS-NS couplings at order $\alpha'^3$ in type IIA theory produces couplings at order $\alpha'$ that become zero up to $\alpha'$-order field redefinition.</description>

      <title>Studies on Carrollian Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the quantum field description of massive Carrollian field theories, with a particular focus on resolving the issue of gauge dependence concerning mass in scalar Carrollian Electrodynamics. We also present the quantum field description for complex Carrollian scalar fields, Carrollian fermions, and Carrollian Electrodynamics. We highlight the challenges in scalar Carrollian electrodynamics (sCED), where the renormalized mass appears gauge-dependent, and clarify this discrepancy by carefully constructing completely gauge fixed propagators, affirming the gauge independence of mass in the Carrollian framework. Utilizing techniques from BRST quantization, we construct the BRST action for sCED and construct Nielsen identities to ascertain the independence of mass on the gauge fixing parameter.</description>

      <title>Effect of Non-Extensive Parameter on Page Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work employs the quantum extremal surface framework to compute the Page curve for black holes corrected by non-extensive entropy. The entropy of Hawking radiation increases linearly with time, leading to the persistence of the information paradox for non-extensive entropy-corrected black holes. At late time, we extremize the generalized entropy functional; incorporating contributions from both matter and the quantum extremal island, we establish that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation saturates to the non-extensive extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Finally, we study the dependence of non-extensive parameters on the Page time.</description>

      <title>A Note on Black Hole Entropy and Wormhole Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent approaches to the computation of black hole entropies through semiclassical estimates of appropriate state overlaps, saturated by Euclidean wormhole configurations. We notice that the relevant saddle-point manifolds may exhibit instabilities, thereby compromising the interpretation of the Euclidean path integral as a tool for computing positive-definite inner products. We show that a proper treatment using a microcanonical formulation effectively addresses the puzzles posed by these instabilities.</description>

      <title>Can Q-balls describe cosmological and galactic dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) hypothesis accurately predicts large-scale structure formation and fits the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature fluctuations (CMB). However, observations of the inner regions of dark matter halos and dwarf galaxy satellites have consistently posed challenges to CDM. On the other hand, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis can explain galactic phenomena but fails to account for the complex shape of the CMB and matter power spectra. CDM and MOND are effective in nearly mutually exclusive regimes, prompting the question: Is there a physical mechanism where CDM and MOND share a common origin? Q-balls, which are localized, non-topological solitons, can be a bridge between the two hypotheses. Q-balls formed in the early Universe can mimic CDM at cosmological scales. Interestingly, Q-balls can exhibit MOND-like behavior in the late Universe at galactic scales, providing a unified framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that millicharged composite Q-balls formed from complex scalar fields, decoupled from the background radiation, can naturally arise during the radiation-dominated epoch. From the matter-radiation equality, we also obtain the mass of Q-balls to be $1~{eV}$, which are much smaller than the electron mass. Using the constraints from the invisible decay mode of ortho-positronium, we obtain $Q &lt; 3.4 \times 10^{-5}$. We also establish an upper bound on the number density of Q-balls, which depends on the charge of the Q-ball and the small initial charge asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MOND naturally emerges at the galactic scale within the framework of our Q-ball model.</description>

      <title>Antipodal self-duality of square fishnet graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly deformed planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, or fishnet theory, a correlation function of four dimension-$m$ protected operators is given by a single Feynman integral, which involves integrating over locations of a $m\times m$ grid of points. We show that for any integer $m$ this square fishnet graph is invariant under the combined action of a kinematic map and the antipode map of the Hopf algebra on multiple polylogarithms, i.e. it possesses an antipodal self-duality.</description>

      <title>Topological Casimir effect for fermionic condensate in AdS spacetime with compact dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate combined effects of gravitational field and spatial topology on the fermionic condensate (FC) for a massive Dirac field in locally anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with a part of spatial dimensions compactified to a torus. For general phases in the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions the topological Casimir contribution is explicitly extracted and the renormalization is reduced to the one for purely AdS spacetime. The FC is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by compact dimension with the period of flux quantum. The topological contribution vanishes on the AdS boundary and dominates in the total FC in the region near the AdS horizon. For proper lengths of compact dimensions smaller than the AdS curvature radius the influence of the gravitational field is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the FC for a locally Minkowski spacetime with compact dimensions. For large proper lengths the decay of the topological FC follows a power law for both massless and massive field, in contrast to an exponential decay in Minkowski bulk for massive fields. Applications are discussed for 2D Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary entanglement correspondence and the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture in an $AdS_2/CFT_1$ setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using recent developments in expressing one-loop partition functions in Euclidean $AdS_2$ space-times in terms of character integrals, we relate the one-loop effective action for a free field theory in $AdS_2$ (comprised of a massless scalar field and a massless Majorana fermion field) to the partition function of the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan (DFF) conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) models on the two global $AdS_2$ boundaries. The equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees in the field theory guarantee that the one-loop calculation is free of all UV divergences except a logarithmic one consistent with the expected entanglement entropy behaviour in a CQM. Via a thermofield double representation, we compute the entanglement entropy between two copies of the $CFT_1$ (CQM), each living near one of the two boundaries of global $AdS_2$, in a state at global time $\tau \rightarrow - \infty$. This entanglement entropy is expressed in terms of the logarithm of the regularised length of a closed particle trajectory infinitesimally near the rim of the Euclidean $AdS_2$ disc. We view this relation between boundary quantum entanglement and a bulk geometrical quantity as the $AdS_2/CFT_1$ version of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture in our setup. The boundary entanglement entropy is equal to 4 times the thermodynamic entropy read off from the regularised one-loop effective action in $AdS_2$. Further, we compute the bulk entanglement entropy associated with black hole horizons in Lorentzian $AdS_2$ and show that it precisely matches the boundary entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent solutions of biadjoint scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biadjoint scalar field theories appear in the study of scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in gauge, gravity and related theories. In this paper, we present new exact solutions of biadjoint scalar field theory, showing that time-dependent solutions are possible and analytically tractable. We generalise the theory to include mass and / or quartic terms, and also a coupling to a constant background field. This allows for more exact solutions, which make contact with previous soliton literature. We also find bounded solutions, in contrast to all known previous examples. Our results may be useful for the study of non-perturbative aspects of the double copy between gauge theories and gravity. We also speculate as to their possible practical applications.</description>

      <title>Quiver Yangians as Coulomb branch algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a 3D N=4 gauge theory, turning on the $\Omega$-background in RxR$^2_{\epsilon}$ deforms the Coulomb branch chiral ring into the quantum Coulomb branch algebra, generated by the 1/2-BPS monopoles together with the complex scalar in the vector-multiplet. We conjecture that for a 3D N=4 quiver gauge theory with unitary gauge group, the quantum Coulomb branch algebra can be formulated as the truncated shifted quiver Yangian Y$(\widehat{Q},\widehat{W})$ based on the triple quiver $\widehat{Q}$ of the original quiver Q with canonical potential $\widehat{W}$. We check this conjecture explicitly for general tree-type quivers Q by considering the action of monopoles on the 1/2-BPS vortex configurations. The Hilbert spaces of vortices approaching different vacua at spatial infinity furnish different representations of the shifted quiver Yangian, and all the charge functions have only simple poles. For quivers beyond tree-type, our conjecture is consistent with known results on special examples.</description>

      <title>Note on 't Hooft's Shock Wave Commutators From Near Horizon Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a finite model of 't Hooft's shock wave commutation relations from the ansatz\cite{Carlip}\cite{Solodukhin}\cite{BZ} that the quantum degrees of freedom in a causal diamond in a solution of Einstein's Equations are those of a (cut-off\cite{BZ}\cite{hilbertbundles} ) 1 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge related to the area of the diamond's holographic screen by equating Cardy's formula with the generalized Bekenstein-Hawking formula\cite{ted95}\cite{fsb}. The particular CFT is an exactly marginal perturbation of free massless fermions, as motivated by the Holographic Space-Time\cite{hilbertbundles} (HST) program. The momentum cutoff in $1 + 1$ dimensions and the Dirac eigenvalue cutoff on the transverse geometry, modify the 't Hooft relations when the area of the diamond is finite and remove all coincident point divergences in predictions derived from these commutation relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study strong coupling asymptotic expansions of ${\mathcal N}=2$ $D=4$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory partition functions in general $\Omega$-background. This is done by refining Painlev\'e/gauge theory correspondence in terms of quantum Painlev\'e equations, obtained from $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations. We present a general ansatz and a systematic analysis of the expansions of the gauge theory partition functions by solving the above equations around the strong coupling singularities, including Argyres-Douglas points. We compare our results with refined holomorphic anomaly equations and irregular Virasoro conformal blocks.</description>

      <title>Off-shell phase diagram of BPS black holes in AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the off-shell free energy of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5$, and study the phase diagram in various limiting cases, with particular emphasis on BPS thermodynamics. The changes to the free energy following from the four-derivative corrections to five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity action are computed, and the modifications to the phase diagram are studied. Starting from Landau's theory, an exact method is systematically developed to construct the off shell BPS free energy, which in certain limiting cases, can be rearranged in terms of an effective energy and entropy of the system, with the later being conjugate to an effective BPS temperature. The off-shell BPS phase diagram shows features which resemble the phases of general AdS Schwarzschild black holes, with some nuances in the asymptotic structure, modified by four-derivative corrections. Using AdS/CFT, phenomenological effective potentials in the boundary gauge theory are proposed, dual to both general black holes and their BPS counterparts. The saddle points of the effective potential capture the various locally stable and unstable phases of the gauge theory at finite temperature and chemical potential.</description>

      <title>On quivers, spectral networks and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently found that connection coefficients of the Heun equation can be derived in closed form using crossing symmetry in two-dimensional Liouville theory via the Nekrasov-Shatashvili functions. In this work, we systematize this approach to second-order linear ODEs of Fuchsian type, which arise in the description of N = 2, four-dimensional quiver gauge theories. After presenting the general procedure, we focus on the specific case of Fuchsian equations with five regular singularities and present some applications to black hole perturbation theory. First, we consider a massive scalar perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole in AdS7. Next, we analyze vector type perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS5 black hole. We also discuss the implications of our results in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence and present explicit results in the large spin limit, where we make connection with the light-cone bootstrap. Furthermore, using the spectral network technology, we identify the region of the moduli space in Seiberg-Witten theory that is relevant for the study of black hole quasinormal modes. Our results suggest that, in some cases, this region corresponds to the strong-coupling regime, highlighting the potential applicability of the conformal GMN TBA framework to address scenarios where the gravitational dictionary implies that the instanton counting parameters are not parametrically small.</description>

      <title>The Superconformal Index and Black Hole Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ has provided powerful insights into the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5\times S^5$, including some sub-leading logarithmic and non-perturbative corrections. Recently, the phase space of supersymmetric solutions has been argued to contain configurations other than the asymptotically AdS$_5$ black hole. Such configurations include the so-called grey galaxies where the black hole at the center is surrounded by a gas of gravitons. By numerically evaluating the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills at small values of $N$, we detect systematic deviations from the entropy of black holes with two distinct angular momenta. We find that the giant graviton expansion of the index is a numerically efficient way of evaluating the index that complements the direct character evaluation and allows for explicit access to $N\le 15$ with up to two giant gravitons in the expansion. We find it remarkable that a supersymmetric quantity in field theory, usually thought of as a rigid counting observable, indeed contains information about different phases in the space of supersymmetric solutions on the gravity side.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes play a prominent role in relaxation of diverse physical systems to equilibria, ranging from astrophysical black holes to tiny droplets of quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC accelerators. We propose that a novel kind of quasinormal modes govern the direct approach to self-similar time evolution of nonthermal fixed points, whose relevance ranges from high energy physics to cold atom gases. We utilize black hole perturbation theory techniques to compute the spectrum of these far from equilibrium quasinormal modes for a kinetic theory with a Focker-Planck collision kernel in isotropic and homogeneous states. Our conclusion is that quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points give rise to a tower of progressively more decaying power-law contributions. A byproduct of our analysis is a precise determination and improved understanding of the distribution function characterizing nonthermal fixed points.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-loop amplitudes for $q\bar{q}\to \gamma \gamma$ and $gg \to \gamma \gamma$ mediated by a heavy-quark loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the analytic computation of the two-loop scattering amplitudes for the production of two photons in parton-parton scattering, mediated by loops of heavy quarks. Due to the presence of integrals of elliptic type, both partonic channels have been previously computed using semi-numerical methods. In this paper, leveraging new advances in the theory of differential equations for elliptic Feynman integrals, we derive a canonical basis for all integrals involved and compute them in terms of independent iterated integrals over elliptic and polylogarithmic differential forms. We use this representation to showcase interesting cancellations in the physical expressions for the scattering amplitudes. Furthermore, we address their numerical evaluation by producing series expansion representations for the whole amplitudes, which we demonstrate to be fast and numerically reliable across a large region of the phase space.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing FHDE with Scalar and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE) model to reconstruct it by means of dynamic candidates such as ($i$) Quintessence, ($ii$) K-essence, ($iii$) Dilaton, ($iv$) Yang-Mills condensate, ($v$) DBI-essence, and ($vi$) Tachyonic fields in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. In particular, the dark-energy possibilities ($i$)-($vi$) are formulated through suitable field descriptions. Being concrete, we establish a comprehensive correspondence between FHDE and suitable scalar and gauge field frameworks that co-substantiate our investigation and subsequent discussion. In more detail, we methodically compute the corresponding Equation of State (EoS) parameters and field (kinetic and potential) features for the fractional parameter ($\alpha$) range, viz. $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. Conclusively, our results show that the modifications brought by the fractional features satisfactorily enable late-time cosmic acceleration, together with avoiding quantum instabilities by preventing the EoS from entering the phantom divide i.e., $\omega(z)\rightarrow-\infty$, which is a common issue in standard scalar field models without fractional dynamics (e.g., K-essence field). Our findings further indicate that fractional calculus attributes can be significant in addressing the challenges of dark-energy models by offering a robust framework to prospect late-time acceleration and properly fitting observational constraints. Notably, we find that as the fractional features start to dominate, the EoS parameter of all the effective field configurations asymptotically approaches a $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in the far-future limit $z\rightarrow-1$. In summary, the recent perspective introduced by FHDE \citep{Trivedi:2024inb} can indeed be cast as a promising aspirant through the use of prominent field frameworks.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor in the 2D Ising CFT in full modular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of lattice operators for the energy-momentum (EM) tensor in the Ising CFT is derived in the spin variables. Our expression works under arbitrary affine transformation both on triangular and hexagonal lattices (where the former includes the rectangular lattices). The correctness of the operators is numerically confirmed in Monte Carlo calculations by comparing the results with the conformal Ward identity, including the operator normalization. In the derivation of the EM tensor, a staggered structure of the affine-transformed hexagonal lattice is analyzed, which shows a peculiar shift from the circumcenter dual lattice and appears as a mixing angle between the holomorphic part $T(z)$ and the antiholomorphic part $\tilde T(\bar z)$. The details of this contribution will appear in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi|^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several standard features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.</description>

      <title>Novel charged black hole solutions in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric solutions in the context of Conformal Killing Gravity, a recently proposed modified theory of gravity that offers a new approach to the cosmological constant problem. Coupling this new theory with nonlinear electrodynamics, we derive the corresponding field equations and study their behavior under different parameter choices. We analyze three different models, each focusing on different key parameters. Our results reveal a rich causal structure with multiple horizons and transitions between extreme and non-extreme solutions depending on the parameter values. Moreover, we compute the nonlinear Lagrangian density for each model and find that it agrees with Maxwell theory in the limit $F \rightarrow 0$. We also confirm the existence of a central curvature singularity via the Kretschmann scalar. To connect our theoretical results with observational prospects, we study the black hole shadows associated with each model. The analysis shows that the calculated shadow size and shape of the three proposed models are consistent with the data for the supermassive object at the center of our galaxy and are therefore possible candidates for modeling this structure.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-loop corrections (1LC) to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, arising from cubic interactions in the single-field E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) production, are numerically calculated. The results demonstrate the 1LC contributes merely a few percent to the tree-level power spectrum. The model parameters are chosen to predict the PBH masses in the asteroid-mass range, while maintaining consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations within 1$\sigma$ confidence levels, and obeying the upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. The PBH formed on scales smaller than the inflation scale can constitute a significant fraction of the present dark matter (DM). The PBH-induced gravitational waves (GW) may be detectable by the future space-based gravitational interferometers. We also consider a reconstruction of the scalar potential from possible GW observations and present a numerical approach tested in the parameter space of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel implementations of Starobisky-like inflation within Supergravity adopting Kahler potentials for the inflaton which parameterize hyperbolic geometries known from the T-model inflation. The associated superpotentials are consistent with an R and a global or gauge U(1)_X symmetries. The inflaton is represented by a gauge singlet or non-singlet superfield and is accompanied by a gauge-singlet superfield successfully stabilized thanks to its compact contribution into the total Kahler potential. Keeping the Kahler manifold intact, a conveniently violated shift symmetry is introduced which allows for a slight variation of the predictions of Starobinsky inflation: The (scalar) spectral index exhibits an upper bound which lies close to its central observational value whereas the constant scalar curvature of the inflaton-sector Kahler manifold increases with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge sum rules for quark fragmentation functions are studied. The simultaneous implementation of the conservation of electric and baryon charges, strangeness and isospin symmetry is achieved when the fragmentation to both mesons and baryons is considered. The results are compatible to Gell-Mann--Nishijima formulas and may be the new manifestation of superconformal symmetry between mesons and baryons. The numerical estimates are performed and compared with phenomenological models. The recently suggested violations of sum rules due to Wilson lines contributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States in Field Theory: No Partial Factorization, Multi-Particle Packaging, and Hybrid Gauge-Invariant Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that local gauge invariance and superselection rules enforce a ``packaging'' principle for quantum field excitations: \textbf{internal quantum numbers (IQNs)} such as charge, color, or flavor are locked into \textbf{irreducible representation (irrep)} blocks. At the single-particle level, this packaging principle forbids the partial factorization of IQNs (e.g.\ ``half an electron charge'' or ``just the color quantum number of a quark''). Extending to multi-particle states, superselection restricts the net gauge charge to a single sector, eliminating cross-sector Bell-type superpositions while permitting packaged entangled states within one superselection sector.  We provide rigorous theorems clarifying (i)~why no partial factorization of IQNs is possible, (ii)~how multi-particle superpositions remain gauge-invariant within a single net-charge sector, and (iii)~how external \textbf{degrees of freedom (DOFs)} (spin, momentum) can be hybridized with these internal charges to form gauge-invariant entanglement. We also discuss how measurements of spin or momentum in such hybrid states lead to collapse of the internal entanglement.  The interplay of gauge constraints and superselection thus gives quantum field states a nontrivial information-theoretic structure: \textit{internal charges must be packaged with each particle's creation operator, yet multi-particle states may form entangled superpositions so long as the net charge remains consistent}.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating pseudovectors in effective field theories for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories which describe the coupling between gravity and matter fields have recently been extended to include terms with operators of non-minimal mass dimension. These terms preserve the usual gauge symmetries but may violate local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. The number of possible terms in the field theory explodes once one allows for non-minimal operators, with no criterion to choose between them. We suggest as such a criterion to focus on terms which violate Lorentz invariance via a (pseudo)vector background field, leaving a number of possible terms in the Higgs, gauge and gravitational sectors. Further study of these terms is motivated by the proposed correspondence between the general effective theory for Lorentz violation and emergent Lorentz symmetry in condensed-matter systems, which is mostly unexplored for higher mass dimension operators and couplings to gauge fields and gravity. We suggest bounds in the Higgs sector and we show that some of the coefficients in the gauge sector vanish at one loop, whereas others have bounds which are comparable with those suggested by Kosteleck\'y and Li for coefficients in Lorentz-violating QCD and QED coupled to quarks. We also find new bounds in the gravitational sector by considering Robertson-Walker cosmology. Finally, we discuss the special case where only diffeomorphism invariance is spontaneously broken and explain why it does not allow for non-trivial Nambu-Goldstone modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Vaidya-type solutions in Weyl conformal gravity (WCG) using Eddington--Finkelstein-like coordinates. Our considerations focus on spherical as well as hyperbolic and planar symmetries. In particular, we find all vacuum dynamical solutions for the aforementioned symmetries. These are, in contrast to general relativity, structurally quite non-trivial. We provide a thorough analysis of their basic properties, such as, relation to other known WCG solutions, algebraic types, singularities, horizons, and symmetries. In the same vein, we also derive, classify, and discuss non-vacuum solutions with the Coulombic electric field and null dust. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of WCG solutions to Einstein spaces and the role of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Dense and magnetized QCD from imaginary chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we computed the equation of state of dense QCD in the presence of background magnetic fields using lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential. Our simulations include 2+1+1 flavors of stout-smeared staggered fermions with masses at the physical point and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Using several expansion schemes, we tuned our simulation parameters such that the equation of state satisfies strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints, which are relevant to the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions. Our results suggest a strong change in the equation of state due to the magnetic field, in particular, around the crossover temperature. A continuum extrapolation of our data is still needed for future applications of our equation of state to heavy-ion-collision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect via Kubo formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceedings article, we present the first steps towards the determination of the out-of-equilibrium conductivity of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in the presence of strong interactions. Using linear response theory, we obtain an analytical expression for the spectral function associated with this effect at one-loop in perturbation theory. In addition, we provide a first estimate of the CME conductivity by calculating the associated Euclidean correlator using quenched Wilson fermions and dynamical staggered fermions in physical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. In particular, we focus on the midpoint of the correlator, which can be used as a proxy of the full conductivity. We present results in a wide range of temperatures, showing how this observable is suppressed at low temperatures, while at high temperatures it approaches the perturbation theory prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Noether symmetry analysis in $f\left( Q\right)$-Cosmology to determine invariant functions and conservation laws for the cosmological field equations. For the FLRW background and the four families of connections, it is found that only power-law $f\left( Q\right)$ functions admit point Noether symmetries. Finally, exact and analytic solutions are derived using the invariant functions.</description>

      <title>$U(1)_A$ Breaking in Hot QCD in the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple instanton-based random matrix model of hot QCD that in the quenched case precisely reproduces the distribution of the lowest lattice overlap Dirac eigenvalues. Even after including dynamical quarks the model can be easily simulated in volumes and for quark masses that will be out of reach for direct lattice simulations in the foreseeable future. Our simulations show that quantities connected to the $U(1)_A$ and $SU(N_f)_A$ chiral symmetry are dominated by eigenvalues in a peak of the spectral density that becomes singular at zero in the thermodynamic limit. This spectral peak turns out to be produced by an ideal instanton gas. By generalizing Banks-Casher type integrals for the singular spectral density, definite predictions can be given for physical quantities that are essential to test chiral symmetry breaking, but presently impossible to compute reliably with direct lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the dynamics of a detector modeled by a harmonic oscillator coupled with an otherwise free quantum field in a curved spacetime in terms of covariant equations of motion leading to local observables. To achieve this, we derive and renormalize the integro-differential equation that governs the detector pointer-variable dynamics, introducing phenomenological parameters such as a dispersion coefficient and a Lamb-shift parameter. Our formal solution, expressed in terms of Green's functions, allows for the covariant, and causal analysis of induced observables on the field. This formalism can be used for instance to detect non-Gaussianities present in the field's state.</description>

Abstract: Approximating the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking by the scarf potential, the scattering of particles by a gravitational wave generated by flyby is described analytically by following the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Pure displacement arises when the wave zone contains an integer number of half-waves. The results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev.</description>

      <title>Competition and survival in modern academia: A bibliometric case study of theoretical high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the career lengths of researchers in theoretical high-energy physics from 1950 to 2020. Using a cohort-based analysis and bibliometric data from 30,149 authors in three physics disciplines we observe a dramatic increase in the ratio of academic dropouts over time. Where nearly all authors prior to the 1980s remained active more than a decade after their initial publication, this was the case for 50% or less by the 2010s. Consequently, the fraction of theoretical physicists who achieve full academic careers have diminished significantly in the last four decades. Additionally, we study correlations between author survivability and potential success factors, inferring that early author productivity and collaborative efforts have become increasingly strong determinants over time. A logistic regression is utilized to interpret the empirical findings through a survival model. Performance measures further indicate that early career collaboration and productivity rates have emerged as reliable predictors of author survivability during the period in which competition has intensified. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts that these developments may have on science itself.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results therefore suggest that non-stabilizerness allows to sharply detect many-body quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of local BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory. The finite $N$ cohomologies consist of the graviton part (subject to the stringy exclusion principle) and the rest which may describe black hole microstates in quantum AdS/CFT. We construct an infinite tower of non-graviton cohomologies in the $SU(2)$ theory and study to what extent they simulate quantum black holes. We find signals for partial no-hair behaviors by showing that certain gravitons are forbidden to dress these cohomologies. This is in qualitative agreement with the perturbative hairs allowed around black holes, which also leads us to a natural setup to construct hairy BPS black holes. The cohomologies are simpler to study in the BMN matrix model truncation of the classical field theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariant quantum field theories (QFTs) with fermions in four spacetime dimensions (4D) have a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry provided there exists a basis of operators in the QFT where all operators have even operator dimension, $d$, including those with $d &gt; 4$. The $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is the extension of operator dimension parity by fermion number parity. If the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is anomaly-free, such QFTs can be related to 3D topological superconductors. Additionally, imposing the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry on the Standard Model effective field theory severely restricts the allowed processes that violate baryon and lepton numbers.</description>

Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holomorphic diffeomorphism anomalies of $2\,n$-dimensional gravitational theories in Beltrami parametrisation (Kodaira-Spencer anomalies) are computed in the BRST framework, using an extension of the Stora-Zumino method. This method, which allows to compute anomalies in a very concise way, makes manifest the topological origin of anomalies. They have a clear geometric interpretation, since they are expressed in terms of Chern polynomials and Pontryagin invariants. The key ingredient is the formulation of the BRST transformations in terms of polyforms, whose total degree is the sum of the form degree and of the ghost number. This approach simplifies significantly the analysis available in literature and it allows to compute many other solutions. Namely, an anomaly, which was computed using different methods, is proved to be a consistent BRST anomaly, thereby supplementing a conclusion in a previous analysis.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry Theories (SymThs) provide a flexible framework for analyzing the global categorical symmetries of a $D$-dimensional QFT$_{D}$ in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system SymTh$_{D+1}$. In QFTs realized via local string backgrounds, these SymThs naturally arise from dimensional reduction of the linking boundary geometry. To track possible time dependent effects we introduce a celestial generalization of the standard "boundary at infinity" of a SymTh. As an application of these considerations we revisit large $N$ quiver gauge theories realized by spacetime filling D3-branes probing a non-supersymmetric orbifold $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Comparing the imprint of symmetry breaking on the celestial geometry at small and large 't Hooft coupling we find evidence for an intermediate symmetry preserving conformal fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks in terms of fermion correlation functions determined by the Heisenberg block. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and regularized Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

On the gravity side, we consider a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the boundary $\partial\Omega$ with tension $\Sigma$ on the boundary CFT. This approach lead us to analytical solutions rather than usual numerical methods. Our computations on the gravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the junction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension $\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's tension and size and reproduce familiar results.</description>

      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <title>Vacuum and Vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of holographic entropy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities that have corresponding contraction maps and argue the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the argued completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study correlators of insertions along 1/2 BPS line defects in the holographic dual to type IIB string theory in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ with mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz three-form flux. These defects break the symmetries of the bulk CFT$_2$ as $PSU(1,1|2)^2\times SO(4) \rightarrow PSU(1,1|2)\times SU(2)$, defining displacement and tilt supermultiplets. We focus on the two-, three- and four-point functions of these supermultiplets, which we compute using analytic conformal bootstrap up to next-to-leading order in their strong-coupling expansion. We obtain a bootstrap result that only depends on two OPE coefficients. We perform a Witten diagram check of the bootstrap result, obtaining an holographic interpretation of the two OPE coefficients that are not constrained by the bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

Abstract: We consider the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theory arising from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills with gauge group $SU(2N)$. We study the integrated correlator between a half-BPS Wilson line and two Higgs branch operators of conformal dimension 2. Using supersymmetric localization, we resum the perturbative series for this observable and obtain exact expressions for both the planar and next-to-planar terms of its large $N$ expansion, valid for arbitrary values of the 't Hooft coupling. Finally, through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we determine the leading terms of the corresponding strong-coupling expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the effect of wave function renormalization (WFR) in asymptotically safe gravity. We show that there are two WFR-invariant quantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in terms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether we fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow of the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In particular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier in the low energy.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories</title>

Abstract: $A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, probing a transverse $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_M$ background. Below the scale of the radius of $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, these theories resemble a circular quiver gauge theory with $M$ nodes of gauge group $U(N)$ and matter in the bifundamental representation (or adjoint in the case of $M=1$). In this paper, we study these LSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the action of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number of non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the LSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in detail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the literature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic $(M,N)$. In view of the dualities of higher dimensional gauge theories to quantum many-body systems, we provide indications that our combinatoric expression for the defect partition are useful in constructing and analysing quantum integrable systems in the future.</description>

Abstract: Four-point gluon and graviton correlators in celestial holography are famously non-analytic, having distributional support. In this work, we propose an alternative graviton correlator that is analytic and displays several desirable properties. We compute the four-point correlator involving one graviton shadow operator and three graviton primary operators from the celestial four-point graviton amplitudes at tree-level. We perform the conformal block decomposition for the shadow correlator in the compatible channel. For the case when the shadow operator is conformally soft, we compute the single-valued completion of the shadow correlator and perform the conformal block decomposition of the single-valued shadow correlator in all channels. We find an integral representation of the single-valued shadow correlator, which allows us to invert the shadow transform to find the single-valued celestial graviton amplitude. We study various properties of the single-valued celestial graviton amplitude. Interestingly, it exhibits a double copy structure in relation to its counterpart gluon amplitude.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study proper time Lyapunov exponents and coordinate time Lyapunov exponents of chaos for both massless and massive particles orbiting four-dimensional and five-dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes, and explore their relationships with phase transitions of these black holes. The results reveal that these exponents can reflect the occurrence of phase transitions. Specifically, when compared to the Lyapunov exponents of massive particles in chaotic states, the exponents corresponding to massless particles demonstrate a more robust capability in describing the phase transitions. Furthermore, we conduct a study on critical exponents associated with the Lyapunov exponents in these black holes, identifying a critical exponent value of 1/2.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical experiments that test the predictions of a conjecture of Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke and Gaiotto concerning the monodromy map for opers, the nonabelian Hodge correspondence, and the restriction of Hitchin's hyperk\"ahler metric to the Hitchin section. These experiments are conducted in the setting of polynomial holomorphic differentials on the complex plane, where the predictions take the form of conjectural formulas for the Stokes data and the Hitchin metric tensor. Overall, the results of our experiments support the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for solutions describing slowly moving non-rotating black holes in the khrono-metric model, a modified gravity theory with preferred time (khronon) which arises at low energies from the non-projectable Horava gravity. We work in the decoupling limit when the back-reaction of the khronon on the metric is small and can be treated perturbatively. For a given black hole velocity, we find a family of solutions parameterized by the khronon propagation speed and regular everywhere outside the universal horizon. On the universal horizon they have a weak singularity manifesting itself in a non-analyticity of the khronon field. Using the behavior of khronon at infinity we extract the leading black hole sensitivity for which we obtain a simple analytic expression valid throughout the phenomenologically allowed parameter space.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional topological paramagnets protected by $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry: Properties of the boundary Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.</description>

      <title>Condensation Completion and Defects in 2+1D Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category, which yields a fusion 2-category of codimension-1 and higher defects in a $2+1$D topological order. We apply the condensation completion to $2+1$D topological order with $\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_4$ fusion rules. In these cases, we explicitly enumerate the $1$d and $0$d defects present in these topological orders, along with their fusion rules. We also talk about other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can also find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized version of the Arthurs-Kelly inequality is derived when the initial state is a tripartite separable state. When each initial substate obeys the minimal uncertainty, the generalized version reduces to the well-known inequality, i.e. twice of the Heisenberg uncertainty. If the initial probe state is entangled, it is shown that the generalized version of the Arthurs-Kelly inequality can be violated. We show the violation explicitly by introducing a special example.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry from entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement.
  We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and $q=4$ (quartic interactions) which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k\ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms times 1/$N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{3/2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{6}$ gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model and simulate real-time dynamics up to scrambling time.</description>

      <title>QuanEstimation.jl: An open-source Julia framework for quantum parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <title>EGUP corrected thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole with quintessence matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reissner-Nordstrom anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole, characterized by electric charge and negative cosmological constant,exhibits a rich thermodynamics structure. In this paper, we consider the influence of quintessence, a hypothetical dark energy component with negative pressure. we have computed the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP) corrections to the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole, including Hawking temperature, heat capacity, entropy function and pressure. Furthermore, as a special case of EGUP, we have computed and compared the result obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with those from the extended uncertainty principle (EUP). This work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between fundamental physics and the macroscopic properties of black holes, offering a novel perspective on the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black holes in the context of quintessence and quantum gravity corrections. More importantly, we found that, unlike in the case of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole, the qualitative behavior for the RN-AdS black hole with quintessence remain largely unchanged, except for minor differences, at the equation of state parameters w=-1/3 and w=-2/3. In addition , unlike RN black holes, the phase transition point of RN-AdS black holes shift to almost zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time relaxation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole, driven by a source term representing an infalling particle in generic orbits. We consider quasi-circular and eccentric binaries, dynamical captures and radial infalls, with orbital dynamics driven by an highly accurate analytical radiation reaction. After reviewing the description of the late-time behaviour as an integral over the whole inspiral history, we derive an analytical expression exactly reproducing the slow relaxation observed in our numerical evolutions, obtained with a hyperboloidal compactified grid, for a given particle trajectory. We find this signal to be a superposition of an infinite number of power-laws, the slowest decaying term being Price's law. Next, we use our model to explain the several orders-of-magnitude enhancement of tail terms for binaries in non-circular orbits, shedding light on recent unexpected results obtained in numerical evolutions. In particular, we show the dominant terms controlling the enhancement to be activated when the particle is far from the BH, with small tangential and radial velocities soon before the plunge. As we corroborate with semi-analytical calculations, this implies that for large eccentricities the tail amplitude can be correctly extracted even when starting to evolve only from the last apastron before merger. We discuss the implications of these findings on the extraction of late-time tail terms in non-linear evolutions, and possible observational consequences. We also briefly comment on the scattering scenario, and on the connection with the soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path-integral of Gauss-Bonnet gravity is investigated and the transition from one spacelike boundary configuration to another is analyzed. Of particular interest is the case of Neumann and Robin boundary conditions which is known to lead to a stable Universe in Einstein-Hilbert gravity in four spacetime dimensions. After setting up the variational problem and computing the necessary boundary terms, the transition amplitude is computed \emph{exactly} in the mini-superspace approximation. The $\hbar\to0$ limit brings out the dominant pieces in the path-integral which is traced to an initial configuration corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary Universe. A deeper study involving Picard-Lefschetz methods not only allow us to find the integration contour along which the path integral becomes convergent but also aids in understanding the crossover from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature. Saddle analysis further highlights the boundary configurations giving dominant contribution to the path-integral which is seen to be those corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and agrees with the exact computation. To ensure completeness, a comparison with the results from Wheeler-DeWitt equation is done.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a four-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter background, the spherically symmetric $(\ell=0)$ contribution to the Hadamard two-point correlation function is computed for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in the Unruh state. Consideration is given to spacetime points located between the black hole and cosmological horizons. Previously it was found in two dimensions at late times for spatially separated points that the Hadamard function exhibits unbounded linear growth in time, with a rate of growth proportional to the sum of the black hole and cosmological surface gravities. Here it is shown numerically that this instability persists in four dimensions, but with a modification of the two-dimensional result due to scattering effects associated with the scalar field modes. An analytic approximation is derived for the growth rate in four dimensions and, in the limit that the black hole vanishes, is found to be equivalent to the rate of growth for the Hadamard function found previously for de Sitter space in cosmological coordinates.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Anisotropic Compact Stars Influenced by Dark Matter under Teleparallel Gravity: An Extended Gravitational Deformation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our investigation, we pioneer the development of geometrically deformed strange stars within the framework of teleparallel gravity theory through gravitational decoupling via the complete geometric deformation (CGD) technique. The significant finding is the precise solution for deformed strange star (SS) models achieved through the vanishing complexity factor scenario. Further, we introduce the concept of space-time deformation caused by dark matter (DM) content in DM haloes, leading to perturbations in the metric potentials $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components. Mathematically, this DM-induced deformation is achieved through the CGD method, where the decoupling parameter $\alpha$ governs the extent of DM influence. To validate our findings, we compare our model predictions with observational constraints, including GW190814 (with a mass range of $2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}$) and neutron stars (NSTRs) such as EXO 1785-248 [mass=$1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$], 4U 1608-52 [mass=$1.74_{-0.14}^{+0.14}~M_{\odot}$], and PSR J0952-0607 [mass=$2.35_{-0.17}^{+0.17}~M_{\odot}$].
  Our investigation delves into the stability of the model by considering causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking Method, the adiabatic index, and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. We demonstrate that the developed model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars. To emphasize its compatibility, we highlight the predicted mass and radius in tabular form by varying both the parameters $\alpha$ and $\zeta_1$. Notably, our findings are consistent with the observation of gravitational waves from the first binary merger event. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained for a slow-rotating configuration. In addition to this, we discuss the moment of inertia using the Bejger-Haensel approach in this formulation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in the generalized uncertainty principle framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, surrounded by the quintessence energy-matter in the linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle framework. Considering the variance in the position to be of the order of the event horizon radius and equating the variance in the momentum to the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we substitute these variances in the deformed algebra. From there we obtained the generalized uncertainty principle-modified black hole temperature and eventually the specific heat of the black hole. Then we calculate the critical as well as the remnant mass and obtain the entropy relation. We observe that the entropy relation includes the usual leading order ``\textit{area divided by four}" term, sub-leading logarithmic term, and higher order inverse of the area corrections. Finally, calculating the energy output as a function of time, we obtain the evaporation time of the black hole. The results show the dependence of the quintessence parameter on the thermodynamic quantities in the framework of linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Validity of black hole complementarity in an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity has been well understood in spherically symmetric black holes. To study its validity for an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole, which has a preferred direction, we perform the thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius and further investigate the criteria set by Hayden and Preskill. First, we derive thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Using these quantities, we conduct thought experiments based on the Page time and the scrambling time, which show that black hole complementarity remains valid, although the energy required for the duplication of information depends on the angle due to the axisymmetric metric.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that an infinite subset of the static, parity-even Love number couplings vanish, to all orders in perturbation theory. This conclusion holds even if the tidal field deviates from axisymmetry. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB B-modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition can produce a B-mode signal whose strength rivals that of testable inflationary predictions across a range of observable scales. Although phase transitions arise from causal sub-horizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on super-horizon scales. Power is suppressed on the large scales relevant for CMB B-mode polarization, but it is not necessarily negligible. For appropriately chosen phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude can compete with inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. These scenarios can be differentiated by performing measurements on multiple angular scales, since the phase transition signal predicts peak power on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>$\theta$ dependence of $T_c$ in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exploratory study to determine the confinement-deconfinement transition temperature at finite $\theta$, $T_c(\theta)$, for the 4d \SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory. Lattice numerical simulations are performed on three spatial sizes $N_S=24$, $32$, $48$ with a fixed temporal size $N_T=8$. We introduce a non-zero $\theta$-angle by the sub-volume method to mitigate the sign problem. By taking advantage of the universality in the second order phase transition and the Binder cumulant of the order parameter, the $\theta$-dependence of $T_c$ is determined to be $T_c(\theta)/T_c(0)=1-0.16(2)\,(\theta/\pi)^2-0.03(4)\,(\theta/\pi)^4$ up to $\theta\sim 0.9\,\pi$. The reliability of the extrapolations in the sub-volume method is extensively checked. We also point out that the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility should exhibit a singularity with the exponent for the specific heat.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a quantum cellular automata model of fermions in discrete spacetime which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Metric Field as Emergence of Hilbert Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made for avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite derivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and therefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in presence of non-local corrections as $R\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein action. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor, $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical scenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple tests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the detectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that, although this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model divergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein Telescope sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Gravitational Waves on a Geometric Condensate background of $(R + \alpha R^{2})$ Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new paradigm for cosmology: a time dependent scalar condensate background originated from the quadratic $(R + \alpha R^2)$ Starobinski model, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\alpha$ the coupling constant. In weak gravity limit the system decouples into a conventional graviton and a higher derivative scalar. It was shown earlier through works from our group, \cite{ssg,sg,us}, that the latter can sustain an oscillatory lowest energy configuration or a {\it{Geometric Condensate}} as it consists entirely of metric degrees of freedom. In the present work, we study Gravitational Wave propagation in this condensate background. We show that the explicit time dependent nature of the condensate can generate curvature and radiation-like contributions in the scale factor evolution in FLRW cosmology. Subsequently the condensate leaves its signature on the Gravitational Wave profile as it propagates in the condensate modified FLRW spacetime. The wave profile is calculated analytically in terms of Whittaker functions. The main novelty of the Geometric Condensate scheme is that no external (condensate) matter from outside has been considered.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ gravity, and compare them with those in $f(\mathbb{T}) = \mathbb{T} + \alpha \mathbb{T}^2$ gravity. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, we notice that the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity rather than curvature in $f(R)$ or torsion in $f(\mathbb{T})$. Using the finite difference method and the sixth-order WKB method, we compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. Tables of quasinormal frequencies for various parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB method. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values, offering insights into the characteristics of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</description>
