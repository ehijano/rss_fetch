      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>Target-density formation in swarms with stochastic sensing and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important goal for swarming research is to create methods for predicting, controlling and designing swarms, which produce collective dynamics that solve a problem through emergent and stable pattern formation, without the need for constant intervention, and with a minimal number of parameters and controls. One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <title>Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemo-mechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemo-mechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.</description>
