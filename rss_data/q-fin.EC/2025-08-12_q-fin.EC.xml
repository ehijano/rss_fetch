      <title>Stochastic Boundaries in Spatial General Equilibrium: A Diffusion-Based Approach to Causal Inference with Spillover Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for causal inference in spatial economics that explicitly models the stochastic transition from partial to general equilibrium effects. We develop a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) integrated with boundary detection methods from stochastic process theory to identify when and how treatment effects propagate beyond local markets. Our approach treats the evolution of spatial spillovers as a L\'evy process with jump-diffusion dynamics, where the first passage time to critical thresholds indicates regime shifts from partial to general equilibrium. Using CUSUM-based sequential detection, we identify the spatial and temporal boundaries at which local interventions become systemic. Applied to AI adoption across Japanese prefectures, we find that treatment effects exhibit L\'evy jumps at approximately 35km spatial scales, with general equilibrium effects amplifying partial equilibrium estimates by 42\%. Monte Carlo simulations show that ignoring these stochastic boundaries leads to underestimation of treatment effects by 28-67\%, with particular severity in densely connected economic regions. Our framework provides the first rigorous method for determining when spatial spillovers necessitate general equilibrium analysis, offering crucial guidance for policy evaluation in interconnected economies.</description>

      <title>Fiscal Spillovers through Informal Financial Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines fiscal policy spillovers through informal international financial channels, using the US stimulus checks as a positive, sudden, and direct fiscal shock. I utilize granular, transaction-level cryptocurrency data combined with an algorithm to probabilistically identify cross-border "crypto vehicle" transactions to construct bilateral cryptocurrency flows between countries. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I compare cryptocurrency outflows between the US and other high-income countries and find a sharp but temporary increase in cryptocurrency outflows as a result of the direct stimulus. I quantify the fiscal spillover relative to expenditure and place an upper bound of 2.52% through this channel. This implies that fiscal spillovers through remittance channels are likely modest in size.</description>

      <title>The impact of brand equity on vertical integration in franchise systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brand equity and vertical integration are focal, strategic elements of a franchise system that can profoundly influence franchise performance. Despite the recognized importance of these two strategic levers and the longstanding research interest in the topic, our understanding of the interplay between brand equity and vertical integration (company ownership of outlets) in a franchise system remains incomplete. In this study, we revisit the five-decade-old question of how brand equity affects vertical integration in a franchise system and present some novel, nuanced insights into the topic. Evidence from a Bayesian Panel Vector Autoregressive model on a large panel data set shows that brand equity has a powerful, lagging inverse effect on vertical integration, such that higher brand equity leads to less downstream vertical integration in a franchise system. Reverse causality analyses identify a less pronounced but present reciprocal effect. Boundary conditions analyses reveal that the negative effect of brand equity on vertical integration is weaker in franchise systems with international presence and in retail-focused (vs. service-focused) franchises, and stronger in franchise systems with more financial resources. These findings (a) challenge traditional views (e.g., transaction cost theory, resource-based view, ownership redirection hypothesis) on the topic by demonstrating a negative effect for brand equity on vertical integration in franchise systems and showing that greater financial resources amplify this effect, and (b) shed new light on the intricate dynamics (temporal causation, reverse causation) and contingencies of this debated effect. Managerially, this research draws attention to the underrecognized strategic benefit of brand equity in mitigating channel governance issues and advise against unnecessary vertical integration, especially when brand equity is robust.</description>

      <title>Global Supply Chain Reallocation and Shift under Triple Crises: A U.S.-China Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: US-China trade tensions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have disrupted and reshaped global supply chains. Existing studies caution that these tensions may not meaningfully reduce U.S. dependence on China-linked supply chains. This study examines the drivers of this unmet reallocation under overlapping geopolitical and public health disruptions. It investigates how these shocks jointly reconfigured bilateral trade and global value chain (GVC) participation and positioning among the U.S., China, and major trading partners during 2016-2023. Using monthly bilateral trade data across all sectors and multi-regional input-output tables for GVC decomposition, we combine a multi-period event-study with structural analysis to evaluate trade-flow disruptions and shifts in participation and functional positioning within GVCs. We find that China's exports remained robust, expanded across global markets, and sustained a rise in GVC participation, becoming more embedded in upstream segments through increased intermediate shipments to Asia and Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. imports increasingly shifted toward "China+1" partners, especially ASEAN, whose trade structures remain closely tied to Chinese upstream supply chains. These strengthening triangular relationships reveal how global reallocation and GVCs have evolved around the U.S. and China across successive shocks. Based on the evidence, we propose a supply chain resilience framework defined by three interacting dimensions: the level of GVC participation, the functional position within the value chain, and a country's capacity to re-couple in the post-shock landscape, conditioned by market diversification, economic complexity, and institutional capability. These findings carry significant implications for trade policy and industrial strategy in an era of geopolitical and geoeconomic fragmentation.</description>

      <title>The Interaction Between Domestic Monetary Policy and Macroprudential Policy in Israel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global financial crisis (GFC) triggered the use of macroprudential policies imposed on the banking sector. Using bank-level panel data for Israel for the period 2004-2019, we find that domestic macroprudential measures changed the composition of bank credit growth but did not affect the total credit growth rate. Specifically, we show that macroprudential measures targeted at the housing sector moderated housing credit growth but tended to increase business credit growth. We also find that accommodative monetary policy surprises tended to increase bank credit growth before the GFC. We show that accommodative monetary policy surprises increased consumer credit when interacting with macroprudential policies targeting the housing market. Accommodative monetary policy interacted with nonhousing macroprudential measures to increase total credit.</description>

      <title>What is required for a post-growth model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-growth has emerged as an umbrella term for various sustainability visions that advocate the pursuit of environmental sustainability, social equity, and human wellbeing, while questioning the continued pursuit of economic growth. Although there are increasing calls to include post-growth scenarios in high-level assessments, a coherent framework with what is required to model post-growth adequately remains absent. This article addresses this gap by: (1) identifying the minimum requirements for post-growth models, and (2) establishing a set of model elements for representing specific policy themes. Drawing on a survey of modellers and on relevant post-growth literature, we develop a framework of minimum requirements for post-growth modelling that integrates three spheres: biophysical, economic, and social, and links them to post-growth goals. Within the biophysical sphere, we argue that embeddedness requires the inclusion of resource use and pollution, environmental limits, and feedback mechanisms from the environment onto society. Within the economic sphere, models should disaggregate households, incorporate limits to technological change and decoupling, include different types of government interventions, and calculate GDP or output endogenously. Within the social sphere, models should represent time use, material and non-material need satisfiers, and the affordability of essential goods and services. Specific policies and transformation scenarios require additional features, such as sectoral disaggregation or representation of the financial system. Our framework guides the development of models that can simulate both post-growth and pro-growth policies and scenarios, an urgently needed tool for informing policymakers and stakeholders about the full range of options for pursuing sustainability, equity, and wellbeing.</description>

      <title>Unwitting Markowitz' Simplification of Portfolio Random Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his famous paper, Markowitz (1952) derived the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of its securities. This result allowed Markowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that Markowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for portfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation of the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the securities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show this, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his portfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his securities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio as with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and variance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities describe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and on the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random volumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation for the portfolio's random returns. The market-based variance of the portfolio accounts for the effects of random fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. The use of Markowitz variance may give significantly higher or lower estimates than market-based portfolio variance.</description>

      <title>Relative Income and Gender Norms: Evidence from Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from over 500,000 dual-earner households in Mexico, we provide evidence of discontinuities in the distribution of relative income within households in Latin America. Similar to high-income countries, we observe a sharp drop at the 50% threshold, where the wife earns more than the husband, but the discontinuity is up to five times larger and has increased over time. These patterns are robust to excluding equal earners, self-employed individuals, or couples in the same occupation/industry. Discontinuities persist across subgroups, including couples with or without children, married or unmarried partners, and those with older wives or female household heads. We also find comparable discontinuities in Brazil and Panama, as well as among some same-sex couples. Moreover, women who are primary earners continue to supply more non-market labor than their male partners, although the gap is narrower than in households where the woman is the secondary earner.</description>

      <title>Remote Work and Women's Labor Supply: The New Gender Division at Home</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how increases in remote work opportunities for men affect their spouses' labor supply. Exploiting variation in the change in work-from-home (WFH) exposure across occupations before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that women whose husbands experienced larger WFH increases are over 2 percentage points more likely to be employed, equivalent to a 4% rise relative to pre-pandemic levels. Evidence from time-use diaries and childcare questionnaires suggests these effects are driven by intra-household reallocation of child-caring time: women are less likely to engage in primary childcare activities, while men working at home partially compensate by covering more for their spouse. These results highlight the role of intra-household spillovers and bargaining in shaping the labor market consequences of remote work.</description>

      <title>Negative redispatch power for green hydrogen production: Game changer or lame duck? A German perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following years of controversial discussions about the risks of market-based redispatch, the German transmission network operators finally installed regional redispatch markets by the end of 2024. Since water electrolysers are eligible market participants, the otherwise downwards redispatched renewable energy can be used for green hydrogen production in compliance with European law. To show how different price levels in regional redispatch markets affect green hydrogen production cost and thus the incentive for electrolyser market participation, we use historic redispatch time series and evaluate various power purchase scenarios. Our results show that low price levels can lead to notable production cost reductions, potentially counteracting uncertainties in redispatch power availability and thus incentivising system-beneficial electrolyser siting. In contrast, the possibility of high price levels can nullify an increase in the competitiveness of German and European green hydrogen through production cost reductions and discourage market participation.</description>

      <title>Reducing Cartel Violence: The Mexican Dilemma Between Social and Security Spending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organised crime in Mexico threatens societal stability and public safety, driving pervasive violence and economic disruption. Despite security investments and social programs designed in part to reduce involvement in crime, cartel power and violence continue to persist. This study evaluates existing policies and introduces a novel framework using optimal control theory to analyse cartel dynamics. Specifically, by modelling resource allocation between security measures and social programs, we identify optimal strategies to mitigate the impacts of cartels. Findings reveal that Mexico's largest cartel imposes an annual economic burden exceeding \text{US\$ } 19 billion, 2.5 times the government's investment in science and technology. We further demonstrate that current budget allocations between social and security programs are nearly optimal yet insufficient to reduce cartel violence significantly. In light of these findings, we demonstrate that achieving meaningful harm reduction would require a significantly larger budget and would take over a decade, even with increased funding.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fees for Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive liquidity providers (LPs) in automated market makers (AMMs) face losses due to adverse selection (LVR), which static trading fees often fail to offset in practice. We study the key determinants of LP profitability in a dynamic reduced-form model where an AMM operates in parallel with a centralized exchange (CEX), traders route their orders optimally to the venue offering the better price, and arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies. Using large-scale simulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market conditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal AMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving these relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the model's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges: fees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient revenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market conditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX and remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee protects passive LPs from severe losses. These findings suggest that a threshold-type dynamic fee schedule is both robust enough to market conditions and improves LP outcomes.</description>

      <title>On the marginal utility of fiat money: insurmountable circularity or not?</title>

Abstract: The question of how a pure fiat currency is enforced and comes to have a non-zero value has been much debated (Selgin, 1994). What is less often addressed is the case where the enforcement is taken for granted and we ask what value (in terms of goods and services) the currency will end up taking. Establishing a decentralised mechanism for price formation has proven a challenge for economists: "Since no decentralized out-of-equilibrium adjustment mechanism has been discovered, we currently have no acceptable dynamical model of the Walrasian system" (Gintis 2006). In his paper, Gintis put forward a model for price discovery based on the evolution of the model's agents, i.e. "poorly performing agents dying and being replaced by copies of the well performing agents." It seems improbable that this mechanism is the driving force behind price discovery in the real world. This paper proposes a more realistic mechanism and presents results from a corresponding agent based model.</description>

Abstract: In many rural areas of low- and middle-income countries, weekly gatherings of buyers and sellers are the most tangible manifestation of the market economy. Knowing these markets' whereabouts and activity over time could provide insights in otherwise data-scarce environments, helping researchers and policymakers to better understand poor rural economies. But these markets are by nature informal and scattered widely across often-remote regions. As a result, data on this fundamental institution is sparse and inconsistent. We develop, test, and apply a method to fill this gap, leveraging market activity's unique temporal and visual signature in satellite imagery. Using secondary data from Kenya, Malawi, and Mozambique, we first confirm that we detect markets with high sensitivity and specificity. We then derive a map of 1,712 markets in Ethiopia and track their activity at up-to-weekly frequency between 2017 and 2024. Measured market activity exhibits seasonal patterns following local agricultural calendars and responds to weather and conflict shocks. Our approach requires no ground-truth data, is applicable wherever periodic markets exist, and can be fully automated to produce an up-to-weekly measure of economic conditions in areas where such data is otherwise generally not available.</description>

      <title>The effect of minimum wages on employment in the presence of productivity fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, the impact of minimum wages on employment has been studied, and it is generally believed to have a negative effect. Yet, some recent studies have shown that the impact of minimum wages on employment can sometimes be positive. In addition, certain recent proposals set a higher minimum wage than the wage earned by some high-productivity workers. However, the impact of minimum wages on employment has been primarily studied on low-skilled workers, whereas there is limited research on high-skilled workers. To address this gap and examine the effects of minimum wages on high-productivity workers' employment, I construct a macroeconomic model incorporating productivity fluctuations, incomplete markets, directed search, and on-the-job search and compare the steady-state distributions between the baseline model and the model with a minimum wage. As a result, binding minimum wages increase the unemployment rate of both low and high-productivity workers.</description>

      <title>Ukrainian-style oligarchic economies: how concentrated power undermines value added in production chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oligarchic control exerts significant distortions on economic efficiency. Ukraine exemplifies this phenomenon, where oligarchs dominate key sectors and achieve economies of scale through vertical integration of coal mines, steel mills, and power plants while controlling critical infrastructure (e.g. access to transportation networks) to stifle competition. Their Soviet-era production chain monopolization strategies, coupled with political patronage networks (including both local and national governments), reinforce systemic inefficiencies and barriers to market entry.
  Although existing studies highlight the developmental benefits of de-oligarchization, this work advances the literature through computational modeling. We develop an agent-based model of a partially oligarch-controlled economy, where firms with heterogeneous production functions interact within a value-added network. Through numerical simulations, we quantify how different de-oligarchization policies affect aggregate GDP growth.
  The results indicate that the optimal de-oligarchization strategies are determined by the position of the oligarch in the production chain. Depending on the oligarch's position, dismantling oligarchic structures should either focus on removing oligarchs' access to raw materials or on breaking oligarchs' influence on other transactions in the production chain.</description>

Abstract: In 2023, the European Economic Association (EEA) Minorities in Economics Committee, in collaboration with the German Economic Association, conducted a professional climate survey to assess diversity, equity, and inclusion in the European economics profession.The survey gathered responses from 861 current and former EEA members, capturing demographic data and experiences across gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ identity, disability, and socioeconomic background. Results revealed widespread disparities in perceptions of inclusion, respect, and professional treatment. Reports of discrimination, exclusion, and harassment were significantly higher among women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities. Geographic differences also emerged, with the Nordic countries reporting the most positive climate and the UK and Italy showing higher levels of dissatisfaction and discrimination. Compared to the American Economic Association 2018 survey, European respondents reported lower satisfaction overall.</description>

      <title>Document Valuation in LLM Summaries: A Cluster Shapley Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley, an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.</description>
