      <title>Experimental demonstration of electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth rotates through the axisymmetric part of its own magnetic field, but a simple proof shows that it is impossible to use this to generate electricity in a conductor rotating with Earth.However, we previously identified implicit assumptions underlying this proof and showed theoretically that these could be violated and the proof circumvented. This requires using a soft magnetic material with a topology satisfying a particular mathematical condition and a composition and scale favoring magnetic diffusion, i.e. having a low magnetic Reynolds number Rm (C.F. Chyba, K.P. Hand, Electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field. Phys. Rev. Applied 6, 014017-1-18 (2016)). Here we realize these requirements with a cylindrical shell of manganese-zinc ferrite. Controlling for thermoelectric and other potentially confounding effects (including 60 Hz and RF background), we show that this small demonstration system generates a continuous DC voltage and current of the (low) predicted magnitude. We test and verify other predictions of the theory: voltage and current peak when the cylindrical shell's long axis is orthogonal to both Earth's rotational velocity v and magnetic field; voltage and current go to zero when the entire apparatus (cylindrical shell together with current leads and multimeters) is rotated 90 degrees to orient the shell parallel to v; voltage and current again reach a maximum but of opposite sign when the apparatus is rotated a further 90 degrees; an otherwise-identical solid MnZn cylinder generates zero voltage at all orientations; and a highRm cylindrical shell produces zero voltage. We also reproduce the effect at a second experimental location. The purpose of these experiments was to test the existence of the predicted effect. Ways in which this effect might be scaled to generate higher voltage and current may now be investigated.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multiport Antenna Array Characterization with PCB-Realized Tunable Load Network Providing Additional "Virtual" VNA Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prototype a PCB-realized tunable load network whose ports serve as additional "virtual" VNA ports in a "Virtual VNA" measurement setup. The latter enables the estimation of a many-port antenna array's scattering matrix with a few-port VNA, without any reconnections. We experimentally validate the approach for various eight-element antenna arrays in an anechoic chamber in the 700-900 MHz regime. We also improve the noise robustness of a step of the "Virtual VNA" post-processing algorithms by leveraging spectral correlations. Altogether, our PCB-realized VNA Extension Kit offers a scalable solution to characterize very large antenna arrays because of its low cost, small footprint, fully automated operation, and modular nature.</description>

      <title>Bandgap-Dependent Doping of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Networks by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer for Stable Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are a promising material for thermoelectric energy harvesting due to their mechanical flexibility, solution processability, high Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities after chemical p- or n-doping. Here, we demonstrate that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) for electrolyte counterions is a promising method for p-doping of polymer-sorted semiconducting SWNT networks. The achieved doping levels, as determined from absorption bleaching, depend directly on both the pH of the aqueous doping solutions and the bandgap (i.e., diameter) of the nanotubes within the network. Fast screening of different nanotube networks under various doping conditions was enabled by a high-throughput setup for thermoelectric measurements of five samples in parallel. For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to reach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those obtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the electrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days in air. These results confirm PCET to be a suitable approach for more environmentally friendly and stable doping of semiconducting SWNTs as promising thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Normal and inverse magnetocaloric effects in structurally disordered Laves phase Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1) compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$ compounds, where x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\delta$TFWHM of the $\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8. RC and $\delta$TFWHM indicate the presence of disorder. Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$. This particular composition was chosen for detailed investigation mainly due to its Curie point (T$_C$ = 282 K), which is close to the room temperature. After isothermal annealing ($\tau_a$ = 60 min, Ta = 700$^o$C) RC decreased from 122 to 104 J/kg, which clearly indicates the homogenization of the heat treated sample. Furthermore, observed inverse magnetocaloric effect is associated with the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd and Co magnetic moments. The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment. The dependence of calculated total and species-resolved magnetic moments on Gd concentration reasonably agrees with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Induced magnetic ordering in alloyed compounds based on Pauli paramagnet YCo$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermetallic YCo$_2$ compound is a Pauli exchange-enhanced paramagnet. Structural and magnetic properties of rapidly quenched YCo$_2$ and YCo$_2$ alloyed with Nb or Ti are presented. Samples produced by melt spinning have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The samples crystallize in MgCu$_2$-type phase with lattice constant a changing from 7.223 A for YCo$_2$, through 7.213 A for Y$_{0.9}$Nb$_{0.1}$Co$_2$ to 7.192 A for Y$_{0.9}$Ti$_{0.1}$Co$_2$, where Y atoms are replaced by Nb or Ti atoms. Nanocrystalline phases can be produced by appropriate cooling rates for the solidification process. By the synthesis process free volumes, vacancies, and alloyed atoms are introduced into the YCo$_2$ intermetallic. Ab-initio calculations have been performed to investigate the effects of substitution on the spin-split electronic band structure in the ordered YCo$_2$. A ferrimagnetic ground state is found in the alloyed systems with substitution on the Y-site which is energetically favorable compared to point defects on Co-sites. However, the experimentally found increased magnetic ordering in alloyed YCo$_2$ appears to be based on microstructure effects.</description>

      <title>Topology-Driven Design of Bianisotropic Metasurfaces Through Knot-Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bianisotropic metasurfaces enable advanced electromagnetic wave manipulation through magnetoelectric coupling. Here, we demonstrate how knot-particles enable single-layer bianisotropic control using their inherent topology. Leveraging their geometric properties, we examine 3D wire configurations characterized by the knot winding numbers (p,q), generating balanced electric and magnetic response. Through multipole analysis we demonstrate efficient polarization rotation with high transmission for different knot-particle topologies. We explore the knot-particle topologies required to achieve perfectly matched polarization rotation and derive simple design rules for the knot parameters without resorting to numerical optimization. The microscopic polarizability tensors and macroscopic susceptibilities reveal the trefoil knot exhibits strong chiral bianisotropic behavior through its magnetoelectric coupling tensor. We implement knot-particle metasurfaces using advanced 3D printing which realizes the full 3D geometry of the wires. We present simplified flat designs suitable for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) fabrication that preserve the essential symmetry that enables the bianisotropic properties.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature-Resilient Hyperbolicity in a Mixed-Dimensional Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic superlattices are used for sub-wavelength focusing, cloaking, and optical thermal management. Typically, these superlattices are constructed of layers of noble metals and insulators. Despite these systems displaying excellent optical performance, the poor thermal stability of noble metals prevents their application in high-temperature environments. Instead, CMOS-compatible transition-metal nitrides are often substituted for noble metals in plasmonic systems since they have high thermal stability at the expense of optical properties. Here, we fabricate hyperbolic titanium nitride (TiN)/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) superlattices with 3D-2D interfaces. The mixed-dimensional nature of the interfaces prevents atoms from diffusing across the interface at high temperatures. The hyperbolicity of the superlattice is found to be unaffected by annealing at high temperature (800 oC for 10 hrs), and TiN/hBN is found to have a larger hyperbolic figure of merit than similar superlattices.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature waveguide-integrated photodetector using bolometric effect for mid-infrared spectroscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide-integrated mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors are pivotal components for the development of molecular spectroscopy applications, leveraging mature photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technologies. Despite various strategies, critical challenges still remain in achieving broadband photoresponse, cooling-free operation, and large-scale complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible manufacturability. To leap beyond these limitations, the bolometric effect - a thermal detection mechanism - is introduced into the waveguide platform. More importantly, we pursue a free-carrier absorption (FCA) process in germanium (Ge) to create an efficient light-absorbing medium, providing a pragmatic solution for full coverage of the MIR spectrum without incorporating exotic materials into CMOS. Here, we present an uncooled waveguide-integrated photodetector based on a Ge-on-insulator (Ge-OI) PIC architecture, which exploits the bolometric effect combined with FCA. Notably, our device exhibits a broadband responsivity of 28.35 %/mW across 4030-4360 nm (and potentially beyond), challenging the state of the art, while achieving a noise-equivalent power of $4.03$x$10^{-7} W/Hz^{0.5}$ at 4180 nm. We further demonstrate label-free sensing of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) using our integrated photodetector and sensing waveguide on a single chip. This approach to room-temperature waveguide-integrated MIR photodetection, harnessing bolometry with FCA in Ge, not only facilitates the realization of fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems with wavelength flexibility but also provides a blueprint for MIR PICs with CMOS-foundry-compatibility.</description>
