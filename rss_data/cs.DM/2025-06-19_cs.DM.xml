      <title>Hamiltonian connectivity of some base-cobase graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been wide interest in understanding which properties of base graphs of matroids extend to base-cobase graphs of matroids. A significant result of Naddef and Pulleyblank (1984) shows that the $1$-skeleton of any $(0,1)$-polytope is either a hypercube, or Hamiltonian-connected, i.e. there is a Hamiltonian path connecting any two vertices. In particular, this is true for base graphs of matroids. A natural question raised by Farber, Richter, and Shank (1985) is whether this extends to base-cobase graphs.
  First, we use the polytopal approach to show Hamiltonian connectivity of base-cobase graphs of series-parallel extensions of lattice path matroids. On the other hand, we show that this method extends to only very special classes related to identically self-dual matroids. Second, we show that base-cobase graphs of wheels and whirls are Hamiltonian connected. Last, we show that the regular matroid $R_{10}$ yields a negative answer to the question of Farber, Richter, and Shank.</description>

      <title>Efficient space reduction techniques by optimized majority rules for the Kemeny aggregation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kemeny aggregation problem consists of computing the consensus rankings of an election with respect to the Kemeny-Young voting method. These aggregated rankings are the geometric medians as well as the maximum likelihood estimators in the Mallows model of the rankings in the election under the Kendall-tau distance which counts the number of pairwise disagreements. The problem admits fundamental applications in various domains such as computational social choice, machine learning, operations research, and biology but its computational complexity is unfortunately expensive. In this paper, we establish optimized quantitative extensions of the well-known 3/4-majority rule of Betzler et al. and the Major Order Theorem of Hamel and Milosz for the Kemeny aggregation problem. By taking into account the extra information available in the problem such as the number of candidates and by considering an additional optimization of certain piecewise linear functions in one variable, our results achieve significantly more refined space reduction techniques as illustrated by experimental results on real and synthetic data without increasing the time complexity of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions of complex networks: advocating for a topological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) uses insights from topology to create representations of data able to capture global and local geometric and topological properties. Its methods have successfully been used to develop estimations of fractal dimensions for metric spaces that have been shown to outperform existing techniques. In a parallel line of work, networks are ubiquitously used to model a variety of complex systems. Higher-order interactions, i.e., simultaneous interactions between more than two nodes, are wide-spread in social and biological systems, and simplicial complexes, used in TDA, can capture important structural and topological properties of networks by modelling such higher-order interactions. In this position paper, we advocate for methods from TDA to be used to estimate fractal dimensions of complex networks, we discuss the possible advantages of such an approach and outline some of the challenges to be addressed.</description>

      <title>A Linear Kernel for Planar Vector Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, an integer $k\geq 0$, and a non-negative integral function $f:V(G) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$, the Vector Domination problem asks whether a set $S$ of vertices, of cardinality $k$ or less, exists in $G$ so that every vertex $v \in V(G)\setminus S$ has at least $f(v)$ neighbors in $S$. The problem generalizes several domination problems and it has also been shown to generalize Bounded-Degree Vertex Deletion (BDVD). In this paper, the parameterized version of Vector Domination is studied when the input graph is planar. A linear problem kernel is presented. A direct consequence is a kernel bound for BDVD that is linear in the parameter $k$ only. Previously known bounds are functions of both the target degree and the input parameter.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy for Maximum PCSPs on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix two non-empty loopless graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $G$ maps homomorphically to $H$. The Maximum Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem parameterised by $G$ and $H$ is the following computational problem, denoted by MaxPCSP($G$, $H$): Given an input (multi)graph $X$ that admits a map to $G$ preserving a $\rho$-fraction of the edges, find a map from $X$ to $H$ that preserves a $\rho$-fraction of the edges. As our main result, we give a complete classification of this problem under Khot's Unique Games Conjecture: The only tractable cases are when $G$ is bipartite and $H$ contains a triangle.
  Along the way, we establish several results, including an efficient approximation algorithm for the following problem: Given a (multi)graph $X$ which contains a bipartite subgraph with $\rho$ edges, what is the largest triangle-free subgraph of $X$ that can be found efficiently? We present an SDP-based algorithm that finds one with at least $0.8823 \rho$ edges, thus improving on the subgraph with $0.878 \rho$ edges obtained by the classic Max-Cut algorithm of Goemans and Williamson.</description>
