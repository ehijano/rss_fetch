      <title>A Firm Link: Overall, Between- and Within-Firm Inequality Through the Lens of a Sorting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a new theory of the observed co-movement between overall wage inequality and its between-firm component. We develop and solve analytically a frictionless sorting model with two-sided heterogeneity, in which firms consist of distributions of tasks, choose how many workers to employ and reward their workers both through wages and amenities. We show that, for empirically-relevant parameter ranges, overall and between-firm inequality are firmly linked: A change in any of the models' primitives increases overall wage inequality if and only if it also increases the ratio of between-firm to overall inequality. Subsequently, we calibrate the model to match the Norwegian economy and find that the increase in wage inequality from 1995 to 2014 had a different primary cause (raising span-of-control cost) than the accompanying rise in welfare inequality (increased skill variance), and that the apparent decrease in wage inequality after 2015 masked a continued increase in welfare inequality.</description>

      <title>The Simplicity of Optimal Dynamic Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental economic question is that of designing revenue-maximizing mechanisms in dynamic environments. This paper considers a simple yet compelling market model to tackle this question, where forward-looking buyers arrive at the market over discrete time periods, and a monopolistic seller is endowed with a limited supply of a single good. In the case of i.i.d. and regular valuations for the buyers, Board and Skrzypacz (2016) characterized the optimal mechanism and proved the optimality of posted prices in the continuous-time limit. Our main result considers the limit case of a continuum of buyers, establishing that for arbitrary independent buyers' valuations, posted prices and capacity rationing can implement the optimal anonymous mechanism. Our result departs from the literature in three ways: It does not make any regularity assumptions, it considers the case of general, not necessarily i.i.d., arrivals, and finally, not only posted prices but also capacity rationing takes part in the optimal mechanism. Additionally, if supply is unlimited, we show that the rationing effect vanishes, and the optimal mechanism can be implemented using posted prices only, \`a la Board (2008).</description>

      <title>The Multi-BMBY Mechanism: Proportionality-Preserving and Strategyproof Ownership Restructuring in Private Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In privately held startups, restructuring ownership is challenging due to diverse and uncertain valuations among owners. Traditional approaches, including the BMBY mechanism for equal partnerships, fail to address the complexities of multi-owner settings and don't elicit true valuations. We propose a novel mechanism that extends the BMBY rationale to accommodate these complex scenarios. Our mechanism ensures truthful valuation elicitation while offering several advantages: it is easy to implement, budget balanced, resistant to collusion, individually rational, and allocates shares to those who value them most. Crucially, it preserves proportionality among remaining owners, maintaining existing power dynamics. The mechanism allows for adaptive control of the eventual number of owners, addressing unique startup needs such as incentivizing employee ownership. This paper contributes to the field of ownership restructuring by providing a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for the complex dynamics of startup recapitalization, potentially improving decision-making processes and stakeholder relationships in these pivotal business transitions.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation in Economic Dynamics with a Non-Smooth Fiscal Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of economic growth models that includes the classical Ramsey--Cass--Koopmans capital accumulation model and verify that, under several assumptions, the value function of the model is the unique viscosity solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. Moreover, we discuss a solution method for these models using differential inclusion, where the subdifferential of the value function plays an important role. Next, we present an assumption under which the value function is a classical solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation, and show that many economic models satisfy this assumption. In particular, our result still holds in an economic growth model in which the government takes a non-smooth Keynesian policy rule.</description>
