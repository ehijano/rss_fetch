      <title>Uncertainty quantification for data-driven weather models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days.</description>

      <title>Causally-informed deep learning to improve climate models and projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate models are essential to understand and project climate change, yet long-standing biases and uncertainties in their projections remain. This is largely associated with the representation of subgrid-scale processes, particularly clouds and convection. Deep learning can learn these subgrid-scale processes from computationally expensive storm-resolving models while retaining many features at a fraction of computational cost. Yet, climate simulations with embedded neural network parameterizations are still challenging and highly depend on the deep learning solution. This is likely associated with spurious non-physical correlations learned by the neural networks due to the complexity of the physical dynamical system. Here, we show that the combination of causality with deep learning helps removing spurious correlations and optimizing the neural network algorithm. To resolve this, we apply a causal discovery method to unveil causal drivers in the set of input predictors of atmospheric subgrid-scale processes of a superparameterized climate model in which deep convection is explicitly resolved. The resulting causally-informed neural networks are coupled to the climate model, hence, replacing the superparameterization and radiation scheme. We show that the climate simulations with causally-informed neural network parameterizations retain many convection-related properties and accurately generate the climate of the original high-resolution climate model, while retaining similar generalization capabilities to unseen climates compared to the non-causal approach. The combination of causal discovery and deep learning is a new and promising approach that leads to stable and more trustworthy climate simulations and paves the way towards more physically-based causal deep learning approaches also in other scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>On a priori bounding the growth of thermal instability waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have previously shown that the nonlinear growth of a finite-amplitude perturbation to a basic state given by a baroclinic zonal flow on the $\beta$-plane in a thermal quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity model can be a priori bounded. In this note we show that, unlike we stated earlier, Lyapunov stability can be proved even when buoyancy varies linearly with the meridional coordinate. In addition to rectifying our earlier results we expand them by deriving an instability saturation bound by making use of the existence of such a class of Lyapunov-stable basic states. This bound can be smaller than that one we estimated before, reinforcing our previous conclusions. We also present a numerical test of the accuracy of the derived bound.</description>

      <title>Precipitation Downscaling with Spatiotemporal Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In climate science and meteorology, high-resolution local precipitation (rain and snowfall) predictions are limited by the computational costs of simulation-based methods. Statistical downscaling, or super-resolution, is a common workaround where a low-resolution prediction is improved using statistical approaches. Unlike traditional computer vision tasks, weather and climate applications require capturing the accurate conditional distribution of high-resolution given low-resolution patterns to assure reliable ensemble averages and unbiased estimates of extreme events, such as heavy rain. This work extends recent video diffusion models to precipitation super-resolution, employing a deterministic downscaler followed by a temporally-conditioned diffusion model to capture noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on FV3GFS output, an established large-scale global atmosphere model, and compare it against five state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis, capturing CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, and qualitative aspects using California and the Himalayas as examples, establishes our method as a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.</description>

      <title>ExoCubed: A Riemann-Solver based Cubed-Sphere Dynamic Core for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.</description>
