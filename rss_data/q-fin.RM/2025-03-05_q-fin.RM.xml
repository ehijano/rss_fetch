      <title>Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Analyzing Earnings Call Transcripts: Methodologies and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning methodologies such as BERT, FinBERT and ULMFiT for sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts. The objective is to investigate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be leveraged to extract sentiment from large-scale financial transcripts, thereby aiding in more informed investment decisions and risk management strategies. We examine the strengths and limitations of each model in the context of financial sentiment analysis, focusing on data preprocessing requirements, computational efficiency, and model optimization. Through rigorous experimentation, we evaluate their performance using key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we discuss potential enhancements to improve the effectiveness of these models in financial text analysis, providing insights into their applicability for real-world financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both separately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy gains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention has been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the estimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a price series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We assess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the war in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated models, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\% to 15\% in terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\% in terms of profits from a realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.</description>
