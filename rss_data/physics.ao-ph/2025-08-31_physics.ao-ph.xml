      <title>Uncertainties within Weather Regime definitions for the Euro-Atlantic sector in ERA5 and CMIP6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain Weather Regimes (WR) are associated with a higher risk of energy shortages, i.e. Blocking regimes for European winters. However, there are many uncertainties tied to the implementation of WRs and associated risks in the energy sector. Especially the impact of climate change is unknown.
  We investigate these uncertainties by looking at three methodologically diverse Euro-Atlantic WR definitions. We carry out a thorough validation of these methods and analyse their methodological and spatio-temporal sensitivity using ERA5 data. Furthermore, we look into the suitability of CMIP6 models for WR based impact assessments.
  Our sensitivity assessment showed that the persistence and occurrence of regimes are sensitive to small changes in the methodology. We show that the training period used has a very significant impact on the persistence and occurrence of the regimes found. For both WR4 and WR7, this results in instability of the regime patterns.
  All CMIP6 models investigated show instability of the regimes. Meaning that the normalised distance between the CMIP6 model regimes and our baseline regimes exceeds 0.4 or are visually extremely dissimilar. Only the WR4 regimes clustered on historical CMIP6 model data consistently have a normalised distance to our baseline regimes smaller than 0.4 and are visually identifiable. The WR6 definition exceeds the normalised distance threshold for all investigated CMIP6 experiments. Though all CMIP6 model experiments clustered with the WR7 definition have a normalised distance to the baseline regimes below 0.4, visual inspection of the regimes indicates instability.
  Great caution should be taken when applying WR's in impact models for the energy sector, due to this large instability and uncertainties associated with WR definitions.</description>

      <title>Tidally dominated flows past a three-dimensional topography: Wake vortices, turbulence, and mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oceanic turbulence influences the transport and mixing of freshwater, heat, nutrients, and other biogeochemical tracers. It also has broader implications for oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Tides contribute substantially to the mechanically driven turbulent ocean mixing through the internal waves resulting from tide-topography interactions. Tidal currents also drive turbulent wakes and shear layers when the topography is 3D. The hypothesis that seamounts are the ``stirring rods'' of the ocean has motivated considerable recent interest in turbulent flow features near 3D topography. It also motivates the present LES of tidally dominated flows (tidal oscillations superposed on a weaker mean) past an idealized steep seamount. Complex interactions occur between the topography, the near wake, and previously shed vortices, especially during the tidal phases when the flow direction is reversed. The topographic wake is shown to be a hotspot for mixing, featuring large dissipation rates in the attached shear layers, hydraulic jet, recirculation region in the near wake, and peripheries of shed vortices. The majority of the observed dissipation is due to the vertical shear. Over a tidal cycle, the volume-integrated local dissipation within the wake is at least four times greater than the internal wave flux that may be dissipated elsewhere. Furthermore, normalized dissipation rates are maximized for the purely tidal setting. Within the tidal cycle, bulk mixing efficiency ($\eta$) varies substantially and is maximized at $\eta \approx 0.25$ around flow reversals.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Super-Resolution from Unstructured Data Using a Transformer-Based Neural Operator for Urban Micrometeorology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) can perform zero-shot super-resolution of two-dimensional temperature fields near the ground in urban areas. During training, super-resolution is performed from a horizontal resolution of 100 m to 20 m, while during testing, it is performed from 100 m to a finer resolution of 5 m. This setting is referred to as zero-shot, since no data with the target 5 m resolution are included in the training dataset. The 20 m and 5 m resolution data were independently obtained by dynamically downscaling the 100 m data using a physics-based micrometeorology model that resolves buildings. Compared to a convolutional neural network, the TNO more accurately reproduces temperature distributions at 5 m resolution and reduces test errors by approximately 33%. Furthermore, the TNO successfully performs zero-shot super-resolution even when trained with unstructured data, in which grid points are randomly arranged. These results suggest that the TNO recognizes building shapes independently of grid point locations and adaptively infers the temperature fields induced by buildings.</description>
