      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity, FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities, cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Pricing and delta computation in jump-diffusion models with stochastic intensity by Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the pricing of financial derivatives and the calculation of their delta Greek when the underlying asset is a jump-diffusion process in which the stochastic intensity component follows the CIR process. Utilizing Malliavin derivatives for pricing financial derivatives and challenging to find the Malliavin weight for accurately calculating delta will be established in such models. Because asset prices rely on information from the intensity process, the moments of the Malliavin weights and the underlying asset must be bound. We apply the Euler scheme to show the convergence of the approximated solution, a financial derivative, and its delta Greeks and we have established the convergence analysis. Our approach has been validated through numerical experiments, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for risk management and hedging strategies in markets characterized by jump and stochastic intensity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying firm-level risks from nature deterioration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the loss of value that companies might suffer from nature overexploitation. We find that global equities shed 26.8% in a scenario of unabated nature decline, while the worst-performing firms lose ~75% of their value. Our risk framework considers five environmental hazards: biodiversity loss, land degradation, climate change, human population and nature capital. We also introduce two metrics to assess nature-related risks: a Country Degradation Index that tracks the damage caused by environmental hazards in specific territories, including nonlinear dynamics and tipping points; and a Nature Risk Score that summarizes the risk that companies face due to the decline of nature and its services.</description>
