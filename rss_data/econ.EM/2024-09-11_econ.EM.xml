      <title>Testing for a Forecast Accuracy Breakdown under Long Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a test to detect a forecast accuracy breakdown in a long memory time series and provide theoretical and simulation evidence on the memory transfer from the time series to the forecast residuals. The proposed method uses a double sup-Wald test against the alternative of a structural break in the mean of an out-of-sample loss series. To address the problem of estimating the long-run variance under long memory, a robust estimator is applied. The corresponding breakpoint results from a long memory robust CUSUM test. The finite sample size and power properties of the test are derived in a Monte Carlo simulation. A monotonic power function is obtained for the fixed forecasting scheme. In our practical application, we find that the global energy crisis that began in 2021 led to a forecast break in European electricity prices, while the results for the U.S. are mixed.</description>

      <title>Bootstraps for Dynamic Panel Threshold Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops valid bootstrap inference methods for the dynamic short panel threshold regression. We demonstrate that the standard nonparametric bootstrap is inconsistent for the first-differenced generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The inconsistency is due to an $n^{1/4}$-consistent non-normal asymptotic distribution for the threshold estimate when the parameter resides within the continuity region of the parameter space. It stems from the rank deficiency of the approximate Jacobian of the sample moment conditions on the continuity region. To address this, we propose a grid bootstrap to construct confidence intervals of the threshold, a residual bootstrap to construct confidence intervals of the coefficients, and a bootstrap for testing continuity. They are shown to be valid under uncertain continuity, while the grid bootstrap is additionally shown to be uniformly valid. A set of Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed bootstraps perform well in the finite samples and improve upon the standard nonparametric bootstrap.</description>

      <title>The First-stage F Test with Many Weak Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely adopted approach for detecting weak instruments is to use the first-stage $F$ statistic. While this method was developed with a fixed number of instruments, its performance with many instruments remains insufficiently explored. We show that the first-stage $F$ test exhibits distorted sizes for detecting many weak instruments, regardless of the choice of pretested estimators or Wald tests. These distortions occur due to the inadequate approximation using classical noncentral Chi-squared distributions. As a byproduct of our main result, we present an alternative approach to pre-test many weak instruments with the corrected first-stage $F$ statistic. An empirical illustration with Angrist and Keueger (1991)'s returns to education data confirms its usefulness.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Valid Inference for Double/Debiased Machine Learning of Causal Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double (debiased) machine learning (DML) has seen widespread use in recent years for learning causal/structural parameters, in part due to its flexibility and adaptability to high-dimensional nuisance functions as well as its ability to avoid bias from regularization or overfitting. However, the classic double-debiased framework is only valid asymptotically for a predetermined sample size, thus lacking the flexibility of collecting more data if sharper inference is needed, or stopping data collection early if useful inferences can be made earlier than expected. This can be of particular concern in large scale experimental studies with huge financial costs or human lives at stake, as well as in observational studies where the length of confidence of intervals do not shrink to zero even with increasing sample size due to partial identifiability of a structural parameter. In this paper, we present time-uniform counterparts to the asymptotic DML results, enabling valid inference and confidence intervals for structural parameters to be constructed at any arbitrary (possibly data-dependent) stopping time. We provide conditions which are only slightly stronger than the standard DML conditions, but offer the stronger guarantee for anytime-valid inference. This facilitates the transformation of any existing DML method to provide anytime-valid guarantees with minimal modifications, making it highly adaptable and easy to use. We illustrate our procedure using two instances: a) local average treatment effect in online experiments with non-compliance, and b) partial identification of average treatment effect in observational studies with potential unmeasured confounding.</description>
