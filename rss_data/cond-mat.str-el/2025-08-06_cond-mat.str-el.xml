      <title>Dichotomy of flat bands in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03029v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials with bands of narrow bandwidth near the Fermi level represent a promising platform for exploring a diverse range of fascinating physical phenomena, as the high density of states within the small energy window often enables the emergence of many-body physics. On one hand, flat bands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals. On the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic kinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat bands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their distinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been realized in very different material settings and chemical environments, preventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two types of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable iron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by the remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features, indicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1) site-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1) site-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the distinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue for understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of magnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice ordering as a key control parameter.</description>

      <title>Electronic ordering driven by flat band nesting in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state systems with flat electronic bands have a theoretical propensity to form electronic orders such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. However, for many flat-band systems such as Kagome and Clover lattices, the flat bands do not naturally appear at the Fermi level, hence not driving the low-energy electronic ordering. Here we demonstrate the concurrent formation of flat bands at the Fermi level and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}\, R30^\circ$ charge order in a van der Waals magnet Fe5GeTe2 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. This charge order is manifested by clear band structure folding below 100 K, yet the band folding is limited to 30 meV below the Fermi level where the flat bands reside. The nesting vector in the reciprocal space connects segments of Fermi surfaces where pronounced flat bands are discovered. Taken together with calculations of the Lindhard response function, our results establish Fe5GeTe2 as a model system where flat bands promote inter-band nesting and electronic ordering. The appearance of the flat band at the Fermi level is reminiscent of the Kondo lattice effect, yet we point out that the flat bands may originate from the abundance of vacancies in the Fe(1) sublattice, where the vacancies induce flat dispersions via destructive charge or spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Magnon Spin Current Modulation through Site-Specific Doping in a Compensated Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the impact of manganese doping at the iron sites in Gadolinium Iron Garnet (GdIG, Gd$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$), employing temperature-dependent spin Seebeck effect and ferromagnetic resonance measurements. Our findings reveal a clear shift in the magnetic compensation temperature ($T_{comp}$) in Mn-doped GdIG, with minimal changes observed in the magnetic and damping properties. Notably, the spin Seebeck signal strength was enhanced significantly with the Mn doping. This enhancement is attributed to an increased spin mixing conductance and modifications in the magnon spectra that strengthen exchange interactions, highlighting the material's potential for room-temperature spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Ising spin ladders of orthopyroxene CoGeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for an orthopyroxene CoGeO$_3$ with magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions that form quasi-one-dimensional ladders. We show that non-collinear magnetic order below $T_N$=32 K can be stabilized by a strong local easy-axis anisotropy of $j_\text{eff}=1/2$ moments, which is induced by ligand octahedra distortions. Extraction of a magnetic Hamiltonian from inelastic neutron scattering measurements supports this interpretation and allows us to establish an effective magnetic model. The resulting exchange Hamiltonian justifies CoGeO$_3$ as a realization of an Ising spin ladder compound.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Strong electron-electron interactions in a dilute weakly-localized metal near a metal-to-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because it is easily switched from insulator to metal either via chemical doping or electrical gating, silicon is at the core of modern information technology and remains a candidate platform for quantum computing. The metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced. Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\delta$-layers as thin as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo regime near the MIT.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Light-Induced Coherent Phonons Mediated by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</description>

      <title>Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. While early samples exhibited limited superconducting volume fractions, Pr substitution for La enabled bulk superconductivity in polycrystals under pressure and enhanced transition temperatures in thin films at ambient pressure. Beyond rare-earth doping, moderate oxygen or ozone annealing improves superconductivity by mitigating oxygen vacancies, whereas high-pressure oxygen annealing leads to a trivial, non-superconducting metallic state across all pressure regimes. These findings highlight the need to elucidate both the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. Here, using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ polycrystals. We find that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ that is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. This behavior starkly contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where similar interstitial oxygen ordering enhances superconductivity instead. Our findings reveal a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, offering key insights into their distinct pairing mechanisms and providing a roadmap for designing more robust superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases - such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe - topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the in-plane $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and the structural transition to the orthorhombic low-temperature phase lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the low-energy dynamics of massless Dirac fermions interacting with a propagating, relativistic photon in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, when we turn on a uniform magnetic field. This problem can be solved when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong. As observed previously, we find that the vacuum spontaneously breaks some of the global symmetries. We also determine the spectrum of excitations around this vacuum, and compute the resulting low-energy effective action. We use techniques that were previously developed for quantum Hall ferromagnets in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Condensation Completion and Defects in 2+1D Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$, which yields a fusion 2-category $\Sigma\mathcal{C}$ of separable algebras, bimodules over algebras and bimodule maps in $\mathcal{C}$. Physically, $\Sigma\mathcal{C}$ is the fusion 2-category of codimension-1 defects, codimension-2 defects and instantons in the $2+1$D topological order $\mathcal{C}$. We realize the rough-rough wall and $e$-$m$ exchange wall in Toric Code model on the lattice by deforming the Hamiltonian based on the corresponding algebraic data. We apply condensation completion to Toric Code, $3\mathbf{F}$, two-laryer semion and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological orders, and explicitly enumerate their $1$d and $0$d defects along with fusion rules. We also mention other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Effective Conformal Field Theory generated from Pure and Dephased Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors and can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields which enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the sampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site system to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Trivalent network model for d$^3$ transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure: Holography from local constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimer models are well known as prototypes for locally constrained physics. They describe systems in which every site on a lattice must be attached to one dimer. Loop models are an extension of this idea, with the constraint that two dimers must touch at each site. Here, we present a further generalization where every site must have three dimers attached -- a trivalent network model. As concrete physical realizations, we discuss d$^3$ transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure -- materials with the structural formula MX$_2$ (M = Tc, Re) or AM$'$X$_2$ (A = Li or Na; M$'$ = Mo, W), where X is a chalcogen atom. These materials have a triangular layer of transition metal atoms, each with three valence electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Each atom forms valence bonds with three of its nearest neighbours. The geometry of the 1T structure imbues each bond with sharp orbital character. We argue that this enforces a ``bending constraint'' so that two dimers attached to the same site cannot be parallel. This leads to a highly structured space of configurations, with alternating bonds along each line of the underlying triangular lattice. There is no dynamics, as constraints forbid local rearrangements of dimers. We construct a phase diagram, identifying configurations that minimize potential energy. We find a rhombus-stripe phase that explains a distortion pattern seen across several materials. Remarkably, the local constraints in this model lead to a simple example of holography. The bonding configuration in the bulk is completely determined by the configuration at the boundary. We recast the model in terms of three Ising chains that are defined on the boundaries of a triangular cluster. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single impurity will generate long-ranged domain walls.</description>

      <title>A many-body marker for three-dimensional topological insulators with inversion symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the previously defined many-body marker for two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators [I. Gilardoni {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 106}, L161106 (2022)] to distinguish trivial, weak-, and strong-topological insulators in three dimensions, in presence of the inversion symmetry. The marker is written in term of ground-state expectation values of position operators and can be employed to detect topological phases of interacting systems beyond mean-field approximations, e.g., within quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Here, we show that the correct results of the non-interacting limit are reproduced by the many-body marker.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>

Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We relate these objects to measures of non-Gaussianity of operators associated to the occupations of the natural super-orbitals, and define how the non-stabilizerness of operators can be affected by such a basis rotation. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>
