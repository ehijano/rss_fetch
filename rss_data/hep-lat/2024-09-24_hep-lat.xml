      <title>Gauge Loop-String-Hadron Formulation on General Graphs and Applications to Fully Gauge Fixed Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>

      <title>Decay properties of light $1^{-+}$ hybrids from $N_f=2$ lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the decay properties of the isovector and isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids, $\pi_1$ and $\eta_1$, in $N_f=2$ lattice QCD at a pion mass $m_\pi \approx 417~\mathrm{MeV}$. The McNeile and Michael method is adopted to extract the effective couplings for individual decay modes, which are used to estimate the partial decay widths of $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ by assuming SU(3) symmetry. The partial decay widths of $\pi_1(1600)$ are predicted to be $(\Gamma_{b_1\pi}, \Gamma_{f_1(1285)\pi}, \Gamma_{\rho\pi}, \Gamma_{K^*\bar{K}}) = (323 \pm 72, \mathcal{O}(10), 48 \pm 7, 7.9 \pm 1.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$, and the total width is estimated to be $390 \pm 88~\mathrm{MeV}$, considering only statistical errors. If $\eta_1(1855)$ and the $4.4\sigma$ signal observed by BESIII (labeled as $\eta_1(2200)$) are taken as the two mass eigenstates of the isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids in SU(3), then the dominant decay channel(s) of $\eta_1(1855)$ ($\eta_1(2200)$) is $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ ($K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1400)\bar{K}$) through the $1^{+(-)}0^{-(+)}$ mode. The vector-vector decay modes are also significant for the two $\eta_1$ states. Using the mixing angle $\alpha \approx 22.7^\circ$ obtained from lattice QCD for the two $\eta_1$ states, the total widths are estimated to be $\Gamma_{\eta_1(1855)}=268(91)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\eta_1(2200)}=435(154)~\mathrm{MeV}$. The former is compatible with the experimental width of $\eta_1(1855)$. Although many systematic uncertainties are not well controlled, these results are qualitatively informative for the experimental search for light hybrids.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and localized Dirac modes in the deconfined phase of 2+1 dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deconfinement transition in 2+1 dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory both as a percolation transition of center vortices and as a localization transition for the low-lying Dirac modes. We study in detail the critical properties of the Anderson transition in the Dirac spectrum in the deconfined phase, showing that it is of BKT type; and the critical properties of the center-vortex percolation transition, showing that they differ from those of ordinary two-dimensional percolation. We then study the relation between localized modes and center vortices in the deconfined phase, identifying the simple center-vortex structures that mainly support the localized Dirac modes. As the system transitions to the confined phase, center vortices merge together into an infinite cluster, causing the low Dirac modes to delocalize.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue based taste breaking of staggered, Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz fermions with stout smearing in the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two spacetime dimensions staggered fermions are minimally doubled, like Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz fermions. A continuum eigenvalue is thus represented by a pair of near-degenerate eigenvalues, with the splitting $\delta$ quantifying the cut-off induced taste symmetry breaking. We use the quenched Schwinger model to determine the low-lying fermionic eigenvalues (with 0, 1 or 3 steps of stout smearing), and analyze them in view of the global topological charge $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ of the gauge background. For taste splittings pertinent to would-be zero modes, we find asymptotic Symanzik scaling of the form $\delta_\mathrm{wzm} \propto a^2$ with link smearing, and $\delta_\mathrm{wzm} \propto a$ without, for each action. For taste splittings pertinent to non-topological modes, staggered splittings scale as $\delta_\mathrm{ntm} \propto a^p$ (where $p\simeq2$ with smearing and $p=1$ without), while Karsten-Wilczek and Bori\c{c}i-Creutz fermions scale as $\delta_\mathrm{ntm} \propto a$ (regardless of the smearing level). Large logarithmic corrections are seen with smearing.</description>

      <title>Probing Celestial Energy and Charge Correlations through Real-Time Quantum Simulations: Insights from the Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux, real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Finding Interaction Mechanism between Exotic Molecule and Conventional Hadron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and important question arises: how do hadronic molecules interact with conventional hadrons? In this Letter, we propose a novel mechanism to address this issue, focusing on the interactions between hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks ($P_c$) and nucleons ($N$). By applying this mechanism, we derive the corresponding interaction potentials, enabling the prediction of the bound state properties. Our results indicate the possible existence of $P_cN$ bound states--an entirely new form of matter, ripe for exploration in the era of high-precision hadron spectroscopy. Notably, this mechanism extends beyond the $P_cN$ systems and can be applied to any hadronic molecules interacting with conventional hadrons, offering the potential for discovering a variety of novel bound states.</description>

      <title>Simulating Schwinger model dynamics with quasi-one-dimensional qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model provide an effective description of quark confinement out of equilibrium, routinely employed to model hadronization processes in particle-physics event generators. Ab-initio simulations of such non-perturbative processes are far beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and remain an outstanding open quest for quantum simulators to date. In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\epsilon^{-1}$. We finally discuss a concrete advantageous implementation using a state-of-the-art dual-species Rydberg atom array. This work opens up a path for near-term quantum simulators to address questions of immediate relevance to particle physics.</description>

      <title>Kolya: an open-source package for inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the code kolya, an open-source tool for phenomenological analyses of inclusive semileptonic $B$ meson decays. It contains a library to compute predictions for the total rate and various kinematic moments within the framework of the heavy quark expansion, utilizing the so-called kinetic scheme. The library currently includes power corrections up to $1/m_b^5$. All available QCD perturbative corrections are implemented via interpolation grids for fast numerical evaluation. We also include effects from new physics parameterised as Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators in the weak effective theory below the electroweak scale. The library is interfaced to CRunDec for easy evaluation of the quark masses and strong coupling constant at different renormalization scales. The library is developed in Python and does not require compilation. It can be used in an interactive Jupyter notebook session.</description>

      <title>The geometric phase transition of the three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling we undertake a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model in equilibrium. We confirm that the loops threading excited plaquettes percolate at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$ and we show that their critical exponents coincide with the ones of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. We then construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters using a random-cluster representation and find that they also percolate at $T_c$ and moreover give access to all thermal critical exponents. The Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameter of both loops and FK clusters demonstrate a pseudo first order transition. This study sheds light on the critical properties of quantum error correction and lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak Coupling Lattice Duality in Non-Local QFT with Application to Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the method of obtaining strong coupling regime expansions for a set of Euclidean Quantum Field Theories on a general lattice, illustrated through a self-interacting scalar field $g^4 \phi^4 / 4!$ on a cubic lattice of arbitrary dimensions. A duality is established between the strong coupling regime of this theory and the weak coupling regime of a corresponding dual theory. For Ising model, it corresponds to other choice of field-theoretical description of the same spin partition function. While the original theory is local, its dual counterpart is non-local. Using Feynman diagrammatic techniques for the dual theory, expansions for the two-point correlator and the free energy per site in the region of large and medium coupling constants $g$ are derived. These expansions appear to be regular as $g \rightarrow 0$ and they require no cumbersome calculations for derivation. Furthermore, they demonstrate sufficiently rapid numerical convergence in the regions of large and medium coupling values. Numerical analysis in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=3$ shows agreement with analytical results from Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, the strong coupling regime expansions are consistent with traditional weak coupling expansions. Unfortunately, this duality does not trivially extend to continuous theories, hence they are not considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetry and chiral transport in real-time Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical lattice simulations of theories of electrodynamics coupled to charged matter at finite temperature, interpreting them using the higher-form symmetry formulation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We compute transport coefficients using classical Kubo formulas on the lattice and show that the properties of the simulated plasma are in complete agreement with the predictions from effective field theories. In particular, the higher-form formulation allows us to understand from hydrodynamic considerations the relaxation rate of axial charge in the chiral plasma observed in previous simulations. A key point is that the resistivity of the plasma -- defined in terms of Kubo formulas for the electric field in the 1-form formulation of MHD -- remains a well-defined and predictive quantity at strong electromagnetic coupling. However, the Kubo formulas used to define the conventional conductivity vanish at low frequencies due to electrodynamic fluctuations, and thus the concept of the conductivity of a gauged electric current must be interpreted with care.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in a mass splitting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treating the $X(4140)$ as a compact $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ state and using its mass as a reference scale, we systematically estimate the masses of doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$. Their decay properties are studied with a simple rearrangement scheme. Based on our results, the lowest $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ state is a stable tetraquark about 20 MeV below the $\bar{B}^*\bar{B}$ threshold. The mass and width of the low-mass $0(1^+)$ $cc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u,d$) tetraquark are compatible with the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The location of the lowest $0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ states are found to be close to the $\bar{B}D$ and $\bar{B}^*D$ thresholds, respectively. We hope that the predicted ratios between partial widths of different channels may be helpful to identify compact tetraquark states from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Poincare Invariance in Discrete Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A formulation of discrete gravity was recently proposed based on defining a lattice and a shift operator connecting the cells. Spinors on such a space will have rotational SO(d) invariance which is taken as the fundamental symmetry. Inspired by lattice QCD, discrete analogues of curvature and torsion were defined that go smoothly to the corresponding tensors in the continuous limit. In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction. We show that, just as for continuous spaces, the zero torsion constraint converts the translational parameter to a diffeomorphism parameter, thus explaining the effectiveness of this formulation.</description>

      <title>Pion Boer-Mulders function using a contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI) is used as the basis for calculations of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs); namely, that for unpolarised valence degrees-of-freedom and the analogous Boer-Mulders (BM) function. Amongst other things, the analysis enables the following themes to be addressed: the quark current mass dependence of pion TMDs; the impact of the gauge link model on the positivity constraint that bounds the BM function relative to the unpolarised TMD; the equivalence of direct diagrammatic and light-front wave function TMD calculations; and the size of the BM shift. Interpreted astutely, these SCI results enable one to draw insightful pictures of pion TMDs.</description>
