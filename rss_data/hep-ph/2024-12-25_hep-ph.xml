      <title>Spin identification of the mono-Z$^{\prime}$ resonance in muon-pair production at the ILC with simulated electron-positron collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the angular distribution of low-mass dimuon pairs produced in simulated electron-positron collisions at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), which operates at a center of mass energy of 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb\(^{-1}\). We focus on the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) variable, defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of low-mass dimuon pairs is primarily driven by the Drell-Yan process, which exhibits a pronounced forward-backward asymmetry. However, many scenarios beyond the Standard Model predict different shapes for the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) distribution. This angular distribution can be instrumental in distinguishing between these models in the event of excess observations beyond the Standard Model. We have used the mono-Z\(^{\prime}\) model to interpret the simulated data for our analysis. In the absence of any discoveries of new physics, we establish upper limits at the 95\% confidence level on the masses of various particles in the model, including the spin-1 \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, as well as fermionic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Catalogues of Cosmologically Self-Consistent Hadronic QCD Axion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the catalogue of "phenomenologically preferred" hadronic axion models to include heavy fermion representations associated with higher-dimensional decay operators. The latter have recently been shown to self-consistently trigger a period of early matter domination, making the underlying axion models cosmologically viable. After identifying all possible representations up to decay operator dimension $d \leq 9$, we update the hadronic axion band for the axion-photon coupling. The central regions of the axion band for axion masses viable in standard cosmology are similar to those found previously and approximately independent of the axion decay constant $f_a$. However, with our adopted assumptions, $d = 6$ and $d = 7$ operators lead to two new viable "model islands" around $f_a \sim 10^{12}$ GeV and $f_a \sim 10^{14}$ GeV, i.e., beyond the standard post-inflationary mass region.</description>

      <title>Improving $\pi\pi$ dispersive analyses and resonance determination with Forward Dispersion Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of an improved pion-pion scattering dispersive analysis that includes: a refined treatment of inelasticities, the introduction of G-waves, the extension of Forward Dispersion Relations as constraints up to 1.6 GeV, and data description up to roughly 1.8 GeV. Additionally, we impose Roy-like dispersion relations. As a result, we obtain three reliable solutions corresponding to three different datasets. From the Forward Dispersion Relation output, we extract resonance pole parameters in a parameterization-independent way using continued fractions.</description>

      <title>Supernova Remnants with Mirror Dark Matter and Hyperons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we use relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation with density-dependent couplings, adjusted by the DDME2 parameterization, to investigate the effects of dark matter on supernova remnants. We calculate the nuclear equation of state for nuclear and dark matter separately, under the thermodynamic conditions related to the evolution of supernova remnants. A mirrored model is adopted for dark matter, and its effect on remnant matter is studied using a two-fluid scenario. At each stage of the remnant evolution, we assume that dark and ordinary matter have the same entropy and lepton fraction, and a fixed proportion of dark matter mass fraction is added to the stellar matter to observe its effects on some microscopic and macroscopic properties of the star. We observe that dark matter in the remnant core reduces the remnant's maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Moreover, dark matter heats the remnant matter and alters particle distributions, thereby decreasing its isospin asymmetry and increasing the sound speed through the matter.</description>

      <title>Physical interpretation of large Lorentz violation via Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical intepretation of effective field theories of fundamental interactions incorporating large Lorentz violation is a long-standing challenge, known as the concordance problem. In condensed-matter physics, certain Weyl semimetals with emergent Lorentz invariance exhibit large Lorentz violation, thereby offering prospective laboratory analogues for exploration of this issue. We take advantage of the mathematical equivalence between the descriptions of large Lorentz violation in fundamental and condensed-matter physics to investigate the primary aspects of the concordance problem, which arise when the coefficients for Lorentz violation are large or the observer frame is highly boosted. Using thermodynamic arguments, we present a physical solution to the concordance problem and explore some implications.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering and New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions of low-energy neutrinos with nuclei provide a unique window to explore various Standard Model (SM) and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) processes. In particular, the recent observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), predicted over five decades ago, has generated significant interest across disciplines. With its high cross section and suitability for compact detectors, particularly with stopped pion neutrinos, CEvNS offers a powerful probe for light, weakly coupled new physics. Ongoing global experimental efforts now aim to leverage CEvNS to test SM predictions and search for BSM signals, where deviations in event rates or spectra could reveal new physics. We present here an estimate of the number of recoil events obtained from CEvNS using the current and upcoming liquid argon based experiments. Furthermore, the event rate due to the inclusion of neutrino magnetic moment is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Zee model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Zee model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry in which we find good predictions in both the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy. Parameter reduction on neutrino sector occurs due to large mass hierarchies between charged-leptons mass eigenvalues and new singly-charged bosons in addition to this flavor symmetry. As a result, we have two complex free parameters including modulus $\tau$. We show several predictions in terms of verifiable observables such as Dirac CP, Majorana phases, sum of the neutrino masses, and the effective mass for neutrino double beta decay in addition to demonstrating allowed regions for our input parameters.</description>

      <title>Forbidden neutrinogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses can be simply attributed to a new scalar beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate that leptogenesis can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe already in such a minimal framework, where the electroweak scalar is favored to enhance the baryon asymmetry. Different from traditional leptogenesis, the realization here exploits the thermal behavior of leptons at finite temperatures, which is otherwise kinetically forbidden in vacuum. We present detailed calculations of the CP asymmetry in the Schwinger-Keldysh Closed-Time-Path formalism, and compute the asymmetry evolution via the Kadanoff-Baym equation. Such minimal forbidden neutrinogenesis establishes a direct link between the baryon asymmetry and the CP-violating phase from neutrino mixing, making the scenario a compelling target in neutrino oscillation experiments. Complementary probes from cosmology, flavor physics and colliders are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry Violation effects in Charmed Baryon Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS) exhibited in the effective Lagrangians governing the three-point interactions of $D$ mesons, charmed baryons, and nucleons. We first construct the effective Lagrangians, and there are 12 distinct terms. As a result, we observe that the invariant Lagrangian under HQSS manifests exclusively in the pseudoscalar $D$ mesons coupling to nucleons and $\Lambda_c$ baryons, whereas nucleons and $\Sigma_c$ ($\Sigma_c^*$) baryons only couple with vector $D$ mesons. By taking into account the violated heavy-quark spin transformation, one can recover all interactions from the effective Lagrangians. Furthermore, we compute the differential cross-sections of the $p\bar p \to Y_c\bar{Y}_c'$ scatterings, where $Y_c,\bar{Y_c}' = \Lambda_c,~\Sigma_c,~\Sigma_c^*$, to reveal the residue of the violating HQSS (VHQSS) on charmed baryon production. Ultimately, by accounting for VHQSS, we aim for precise predictions of production rates, which are essential for the High-Energy Storage Ring (HESR) experiments at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global analysis of Sivers functions, transversity distribution functions, and Collins fragmentation functions within the transverse momentum dependent factorization. This analysis encompasses the latest data from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z-boson production processes as recently reported by the COMPASS and STAR Collaborations. Upon integrating the new data into our fitting, the precision of the extracted d and dbar quark Sivers and transversity distributions, as well as the tensor charge, is notably improved.</description>

      <title>Halo-dependent Anharmonic Effects in Collective Excitation for Light Dark Matter Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon, the collective excitation of lattice vibration in the crystal, has been put forward as a means to search for light dark matter. However, the accurate modeling of the multi-phonon production process is challenging in theory. The anharmonicity of the crystal must be taken into account, as it has a significant impact on dark matter-nucleus scattering cross section in the low dark matter mass region. Notably, such an effect is sensitive to the velocity distribution of the dark matter halo. In this work, we consider the potential dark matter substructures indicated by the recent Gaia satellite observation and investigate their impact on the anharmonicity of the silicon crystal. By employing the likelihood analysis with the Asimov dataset, we present the expected sensitivity of dark matter-nucleus interactions, which can differ from the standard halo model by a factor of 2-3.</description>

      <title>About Matter Effects on Neutrino Mixing Matrix Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is widely known, the flavour and mass eigenbasis in neutrino sector can be related by a reduced unitary matrix, described by 3 real parameters and one phase for Dirac neutrinos, and 2 extra phases if neutrinos are Majorana particles. Neutrino flavour oscillation experiments are insensitive to Majorana phases, which leads to using the PMNS matrix with only one phase to describe flavour transitions. In this paper, we point out one feature of such choice that is commonly ignored: when neutrinos propagate in matter, the reduced unitary matrix PMNS does not properly diagonalize the neutrino system. We present some numerical calculations and analytical estimations to illustrate such statement, and discuss some scenarios where this effect can be probed.</description>

      <title>Large and small hierarchies from finite modular symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moduli stabilization by the radiative corrections due to the moduli dependent vector-like masses invariant under the finite modular symmetry. The radiative stabilization mechanism can stabilize the modulus $\tau$ of the finite modular symmetry $\Gamma_N$ ($N \in \mathbb{N}$) at $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau \gg 1$, where the shift symmetry $\tau \to \tau+1$ remains unbroken approximately. The shift symmetry can be considered as the residual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry which realizes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with the hierarchy parameter $e^{- 2\pi \mathrm{Im}\,\tau/N} \ll 1$. In this work, we study the stabilization of multiple moduli fields, so that various hierarchical values of the modular forms coexist in a model. For example, one modulus stabilized at $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau_1 \sim 3$ is responsible for the hierarchical structure of the quarks and leptons in the Standard Model, and another modulus stabilized at $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau_2 \sim 15$ can account for the flatness of the $\mathrm{Re}\,\tau_2$ direction which may be identified as the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Confronting $h\to Z\gamma$ Excess with the Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximately $2 \sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction in the Higgs decay channel $h \to Z \gamma$ suggests a potential avenue for new physics. In contrast, the precisely measured value of $h \to \gamma \gamma$, which is consistent with the SM prediction, places stringent constraints on new physics parameters, especially considering the correlation between these two decay modes. In this study, we propose a new mechanism and provide a complete analytical calculation in the context of the flavor-gauged two Higgs doublet model (FG2HDM), where a novel type of coupling between the charged Higgs and vector bosons can selectively affect the $h \to Z \gamma$ decay without altering $h \to \gamma \gamma$. However, due to the smallness of the constrained model parameters, additional modifications are required: to adjust the involved $Z$ boson-fermion vertices, extra fermions such as technifermions must be introduced into the model. We show that the FG2HDM, along with the inclusion of new fermions, can simultaneously accommodate the $1 \sigma$ measured intervals for both $\mu_{Z\gamma}$ and $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}$, offering a consistent explanation for both decay modes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a 3-3-1 model augmented with $A_4$ flavor symmetry to address fermion mass hierarchy, mixing patterns, and charged Lepton Flavor Violating (cLFV). The model incorporates an inverse seesaw mechanism to explain the small active neutrino masses through sterile neutrinos. Discrete symmetries, including $Z_2, Z_2^\prime, Z_3, Z_4, Z_7$ and $Z_{10}$ distinct mixing for the quarks and neutrinos . The model successfully predicts observed fermion masses and mixing patterns. Additionally, the constrained parameter space, particularly in the lepton sector, allows for potentially observable cLFV processes like $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently, the two-photon decay width of the $\eta_b$ meson was computed with lattice QCD methods. This decay has not yet been measured. The knowledge of this width allows for the calculation of the $\eta_b$ production cross section through photon-photon interactions in ultra-peripheral $PbPb$ collisions. In this work we present this calculation, which is the first application of the lattice result. Since UPCs are gaining an increasing attention of the heavy ion community, we take the opportunity to perform a comprehensive study of the different ways of defining ultra-peripheral collisions and of the different ways to treat the equivalent photon flux.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations of hadronic neutron stars, quark stars, and hybrid stars : Estimation of $f$, $p$, and $g$ modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives us a notion of the interior of the compact star viz., its composition and EoS. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs, specially the fundamental ($f$) mode frequency. In this work we compute the $f$ and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic matter, quark matter, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$) arising due to the discontinuity in density. For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of the 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ compact stars with the other different properties. We find that the different possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the different oscillation mode frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ compact star, obtained with the different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with the slope parameter ($L$) of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but the magnitude of $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs.</description>

      <title>The allowed baryon to baryon-meson strong transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinematically allowed baryon to baryon-meson strong transitions in all the light and heavy sectors. We consider only the ground state particles in the baryonic and mesonic channels. In the case of mesons, only the well-established pseudoscslar and vector nonets are involved. Using all the restrictions and conservation laws, a \texttt{mathematica}/ \texttt{python} code selects the allowed strong channels among many possible transitions. It is obtained that only five decay channels satisfy the required conditions that all the states are in their on-shell modes. Using the strong coupling constants defining these transitions, we estimate the strong width and beaching fraction at each channel, that may help ongoing experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Effects of a first-order QCD phase transition on the enhancement of light nucleus yield ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to describe the baryon density fluctuations of quark matter along the isentropic trajectories corresponding to different $s/\rho_B$ values extracted from Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-200$ GeV, we investigate the effects of the two-phase coexistence region during a first-order phase transition on the light nucleus yield ratio $N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$. The results indicate that the second-order scalar density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found the significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment should be attributed to the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the charge-parity violating effects through axion field, we investigate the axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars. The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\odot}$ massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Classical (and Quantum) Heuristics for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound on the sensitivity of generic mechanical and electromagnetic gravitational wave detectors. We consider both classical and quantum detection schemes, although we focus on the former. Our results allow for a simple reproduction of the sensitivities of a variety of experiments, including optical interferometers, resonant bars, optomechanical sensors, and electromagnetic conversion experiments. In the high-frequency regime, all detection schemes we consider can be characterised by their stored electromagnetic energy and the signal transfer function, which we provide. We discuss why high-frequency gravitational wave searches are especially difficult and primordial gravitational wave backgrounds might not be detectable above the sensitivity window of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Analytic bootstrap bounds on masses and spins in gravitational and non-gravitational scalar theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive analytic constraints on the weakly-coupled spectrum of theories with a massless scalar under the standard assumptions of the S-matrix bootstrap program. These bootstrap bounds apply to any theory (with or without gravity) with fully crossing symmetric (i.e. $stu$-symmetric) four-point amplitudes and generalize results for color- or flavor-ordered (i.e. $su$-symmetric) planar amplitudes recently proved by one of the authors. We assume that the theory is weakly-coupled below some cut-off, that the four-point massless scalar amplitude is polynomially-bounded in the Regge limit, and that this amplitude exchanges states with a discrete set of masses and a finite set of spins at each mass level. The spins and masses must then satisfy ``Sequential Spin Constraints" (SSC) and ``Sequential Mass Constraints" (SMC). The SSC requires the lightest spin-$j$ state to be lighter than the lightest spin-$(j+1)$ state (in the $su$-symmetric case) or the lightest spin-$(j+2)$ state (in the $stu$-symmetric case). The SMC requires the mass of the lightest spin-$j$ state to be smaller than some non-linear function of the masses of lower-spin states. Our results also apply to super-gluon and super-graviton amplitudes stripped of their polarization dependence. In particular, the open and closed superstring spectra saturate the SSC with maximum spins ${J_{n,\text{open}} = n+1}$ and ${J_{n,\text{closed}} = 2n+2}$, respectively, at the $n^\text{th}$ mass level.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particles Produced from Bubble Collisions in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.</description>

      <title>Using the Th III Ion for a Nuclear Clock and Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 229Th nucleus possesses a unique low-frequency transition at 8.4 eV, which is being considered for the development of an extremely accurate nuclear clock. We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to a significant enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.
  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how the solution to the strong CP problem and the explanation for the observed fermion mass hierarchies can be intrinsically related. Specifically, we explore the Nelson-Barr mechanism and identify its "seesaw limit", where light quark masses are suppressed by large CP-violating terms. Upon adding three (two) vector-like quarks that mix with the down-type (up-type) quark sector of the Standard Model, we demonstrate how the lack of CP violation in the strong sector and the observed quark mass hierarchy can be simultaneously achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the observed excesses around 95 GeV in the di-photon and di-tau invariant mass distributions, as reported by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These findings are complemented by a long-standing discrepancy in the $b\bar{b}$ invariant mass at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) Collider. Additionally, the ATLAS collaboration has reported a corroborative excess in the di-photon final state within the same mass range, albeit with slightly lower significance. Our approach involves the superposition of CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons within the Type-III Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) to simultaneously explain these excesses at 1$\sigma$ Confidence Level (C.L.), while remaining consistent with current theoretical and experimental constraints.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Belle and LHCb Collaborations have measured the $\Lambda^+_c \to p K^- \pi^+$ decay and reported the $p K^-$ invariant mass distribution, which shows a clear cusp structure around the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold. In this work, we have analyzed this process by considering the triangle mechanism and the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach, which dynamically generate the $\Lambda(1670)$. Our results are in good agreement with the Belle measurements, which implies that the cusp structure around $\eta\Lambda$ threshold could be associated with the $\Lambda(1670)$ with the molecular nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</description>

      <title>Disentangling left-handed and right-handed neutrino effects in $B_c \to \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the anomalies in $B\to D^{(*)} \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay, in this work, we carefully study the influence of the most general dimension-six effective operators involving right-handed neutrinos on the four cascade decays $B_c \to \tau(\to \nu_\tau h ) \bar{\nu}_\tau $ ($h=\pi,\rho$) and $B_c \to \tau(\to \nu_\tau \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell) \bar{\nu}_\tau $ ($\ell =\mu, e$). We calculate for the first time the analytical results of the distributions of the differential decay rates of these cascade decays with respect to the energy of the charged particles in the final state. We select a total of 13 new physics benchmark points, among which 9 are derived from the effect of purely left-handed neutrinos, and the other 4 are from the effect of purely right-handed neutrinos. We find that the benchmark points BP4, BP6, BP11, and BP13 can significantly increase the values of these distributions while the BP3 causes a sharp decrease in these distributions. The end-point behavior of the differential distribution $d\Gamma/dE_\pi$ can be used to disentangle the effects of left-handed and right-handed neutrinos. Finally, in order to eliminate the uncertainties brought by the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$ and the decay constant $f_{B_c}$, we introduce the normalized distributions $d\Gamma/(\Gamma dE_a)$ ($a=\pi,\rho,\mu,e$), which are only sensitive to the right-handed neutrinos. We find that in each normalized distribution there exists a fixed point that is not related to any dimension-six effective operators considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Collider and CMB complementarity of leptophilic dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discovery prospects of leptophilic dark matter (DM) in future lepton colliders by considering the light neutrinos to be of Dirac type. Adopting an effective field theory (EFT) approach, we write down dimension six operators connecting the standard model (SM) fields, light Dirac neutrinos and DM. Considering DM relic to be generated via the thermal freeze-out, we check the discovery prospects at future lepton colliders via mono-photon plus missing energy searches. The right chiral parts of light Dirac neutrinos get thermalised due to their interactions with the bath as well as leptophilic DM, leading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The interplay of existing bounds from cosmological observations related to DM relic and $N_{\rm eff}$, direct and indirect detection of DM, astrophysics and collider observations leave promising discovery prospects at future electron and muon colliders along with complementary signatures at future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions and transverse momentum dependence of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading Fock state light-front wave functions of heavy quarkonia and $D$ and $B$ mesons are obtained from the projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions on the light front. We compute therefrom their leading-twist time-reversal even transverse momentum distributions and parton distribution functions. Mirroring the behavior of parton distribution amplitudes, the support of both distributions is increasingly narrower and shifted towards larger $x$ as a function of the meson mass. The dependence of $x$ and $\k_\perp^2$ of the transverse distributions does not factorize into separate functions, and their fall-off with $\k_\perp^2$ is much slower than that of light mesons.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: the Modified BFKL, or where did it all go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue exploring the Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group generating evolution in frequency of physical observables. In this paper we study the evolution of the total cross section for dilute-dilute scattering retaining only eikonal emissions. We derive and analyze the analog of the BFKL equation in this framework. The frequency evolution has a very strong effect on the solutions of the BO-BFKL equation, slowing down the evolution of the scattering amplitude in a spectacular fashion: the intercept of the Pomeron is decreased by about a factor of three relative to the canonical LO BFKL result. The anomalous dimension is also modified significantly - from the BFKL value of one it goes down to the negative value of $\approx-0.2$. Introducing saturation boundary as a proxy for the full saturation dynamics, we find that the dependence of the saturation momentum on rapidity $\eta$ becomes quite weak with $Q^2_s\sim e^{a\bar\alpha_s\eta}$ with $a\approx 0.784$ as opposed to the BFKL value $a=4.88$. Our results underscore the necessity to take into account the DGLAP effects in the high energy evolution. This is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Kernel methods for evolution of generalized parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) characterize the 3-dimensional structure of hadrons, combining information about their internal quark and gluon longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse position within the hadron. The dependence of GPDs on the factorization scale $Q^2$ allows one to connect hard exclusive processes involving GPDs at disparate energy and momentum scales, which is needed in global analyses of experimental data. In this work we explore how finite element methods can be used to construct fast and differentiable $Q^2$ evolution codes for GPDs in momentum space, which can be used in a machine learning framework. We show numerical benchmarks of the methods' accuracy, including a comparison to an existing evolution code from PARTONS/APFEL++, and provide a repository where the code can be accessed.</description>

      <title>Looking through the QCD Conformal Window with Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.01742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conformal window of QCD using perturbation theory, starting from the perturbative upper edge and going down as much as we can towards the strongly coupled regime. We do so by exploiting the available five-loop computation of the $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ $\beta$-function and employing Borel resummation techniques both for the ordinary perturbative series and for the Banks-Zaks conformal expansion. Large-$n_f$ results are also used. We argue that the perturbative series for the $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ $\beta$-function is most likely asymptotic and non-Borel resummable, yet Borel resummation techniques allow to improve on ordinary perturbation theory. We find substantial evidence that QCD with $n_f=12$ flavours flows in the IR to a conformal field theory. Though the evidence is weaker, we find indications that also $n_f=11$ might sit within the conformal window. We also compute the value of the mass anomalous dimension $\gamma$ at the fixed point and compare it with the available lattice results. The conformal window might extend for lower values of $n_f$, but our methods break down for $n_f&lt;11$, where we expect that non-perturbative effects become important. A similar analysis is performed in the Veneziano limit.</description>

      <title>Probing levitodynamics with multi-stochastic forces and the simple applications on the dark matter detection in optical levitation experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the terrestrial environment is permeated by dark matter, the levitation experiences damping forces and fluctuations attributed to dark matter. This paper investigates levitodynamics with multiple stochastic forces, including thermal drag, photon recoil, feedback, etc., assuming that all of these forces adhere to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ratio of total damping to the stochastic damping coefficient distinguishes the levitodynamics from cases involving only one single stochastic force. The heating and cooling processes are formulated to determine the limits of temperature change. All sources of stochastic forces are comprehensively examined, revealing that dark matter collisions cannot be treated analogously to fluid dynamics. Additionally, a meticulous analysis is presented, elucidating the intricate relationship between the fundamental transfer cross-section and the macroscopic transfer cross-section. While the dark damping coefficient is suppressed by the mass of the levitated particle, scattering can be coherently enhanced based on the scale of the component microscopic particle, the atomic form factor, and the static structure factor. Hence, dark damping holds the potential to provide valuable insights into the detection of the macroscopic strength of fundamental particles. We propose experimental procedures for levitation and employ linear estimation to extract the dark damping coefficient. Utilizing current levitation results, we demonstrate that the fundamental transfer cross section of dark matter can be of the order $\sigma^{\rm D}_{T}\lsim {\cal O}(10^{-26})\rm cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Constraints for rare electron-capture decays mimicking detection of dark-matter particles in nuclear transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give for the first time, theoretical estimates of unknown rare electron-capture (EC) decay branchings of $^{44}$Ti, $^{57}$Co, and $^{139}$Ce, relevant for searches of (exotic) dark-matter particles. The nuclear-structure calculations have been done exploiting the nuclear shell model (NSM) with well-established Hamiltonians and an advanced theory of $\beta$ decay. In the absence of experimental measurements of these rare branches, these estimates are of utmost importance for terrestrial searches of dark-matter particles, such as axionic dark matter in the form of axion-like particles (ALPs), anapole dark matter, and dark photons in nuclear transitions. Predictions are made for EC-decay rates of 2$^{nd}$-forbidden unique (FU) and 2$^{nd}$-forbidden non-unique (FNU) EC transitions that can potentially mimic dark-matter-particle detection in dedicated underground experiments designed to observe the absence of the corresponding nuclear electromagnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. We calculated the potential barriers between superfluson flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index. A tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity governs the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $% SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result, while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector, and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$, only the vector submultiplet and the singlet tensor field manifest in the observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order masses. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin, some $SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-1/2 quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>
