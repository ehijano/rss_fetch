      <title>Emergent Cosmology in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, in an FLRW background and a perfect fluid equation of state, we explore the possibility of the realization of an emergent scenario in a 4D regularized extension of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, with the field equations particularly expressed in terms of scalar-tensor degrees of freedom. By assuming non-zero spatial curvature ($k = \pm 1$), the stability of the Einstein static universe (ESU) and its subsequent exit into the standard inflationary system is tested through different approaches. In terms of dynamical systems, a spatially closed universe rather than an open universe shows appealing behaviour to exhibit a graceful transition from the Einstein static universe to standard cosmological history. We found that under linear homogeneous perturbations, for some constraints imposed on the model parameters, the Einstein static universe is stable under those perturbations. Moreover, it is noted that for a successful graceful transition, the equation of state $\omega$ must satisfy the conditions $-1 &lt; \omega &lt;0$ and $\omega &lt; -1$ for closed and open universes, respectively. Also, under density perturbations, the Einstein static universe is unstable if the fluid satisfies the strong energy condition but is stable if it violates it, for both closed and open universes. Furthermore, the Einstein static universe is seen to be stable under vector perturbations and tensor perturbations, regardless of whether the fluid obeys or violates the SEC.</description>

      <title>On the physical significance of black hole quasinormal mode spectra instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown, via specific examples and a pseudospectrum analysis, that the black hole quasinormal spectra are unstable. The implication of such a result for gravitational-wave physics and of our understanding of black holes is, still, unclear. The purpose of this work is twofold: (i) we show that some of the setups leading to instabilities are unphysical and triggered by exotic matter or extreme spacetimes; (ii) nevertheless, we also show simple examples of compelling physical scenarios leading to spectral instabilities. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the overtone content of time-domain waveforms, and their detectability.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of modified gravity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a fundamental flaw in the application of modified gravity theories in cosmology, taking $f(R)$ gravity as a paradigmatic example. This theory contains a scalar degree of freedom that couples to the matter stress-energy tensor but not to gravitational energy. However, when applied to cosmology this theory is unable to distinguish between gravitational and non-gravitational energy. Hence the cosmological version of the theory does not coincide with its own macroscopic average, and we show that this leads to order-one discrepancies. We argue that the same inconsistency is common to many other modified gravity theories with extra degrees of freedom. Our results put into question whether these theories can make sense as the cosmological average of a fundamental theory, hence challenging their physical significance.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity surrogate models for exotic compact objects: the case of head-on mergers of equal-mass Proca stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several high-accuracy surrogate models for gravitational-wave signals from equal-mass head-on mergers of Proca stars, computed through the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$. We also discuss the current state of the model extensions to mergers of Proca stars with different masses, and the particular challenges that these present. The models are divided in two main categories: two-stage and monolithic. In the two-stage models, a dimensional reduction algorithm is applied to embed the data in a reduced feature space, which is then interpolated in terms of the physical parameters. For the monolithic models, a single neural network is trained to predict the waveform from the input physical parameter. Our model displays mismatches below $10^{-3}$ with respect to the original numerical waveforms. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model in full Bayesian parameter inference through the accurate recovery of numerical relativity signals injected in zero-noise, together with the analysis of GW190521. For the latter, we observe excellent agreement with existing results that make use of full numerical relativity.</description>

      <title>Decoding quantum gravity information with black hole accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of Loop Quantum Gravity theory with the classical gravitational collapse model has effectively addressed the singularity problem of black holes and predicted the emergence of white holes in the late stages of collapse. The quantum extension of Kruskal spacetime suggests that the appearance of white holes may carry information from companion black holes in the universe earlier than ours. Photons emitted from the accretion disk of companion black holes will enter the companion black hole, traverse through quantum regions from the white hole to our universe, and produce imaging of accretion disk carrying quantum gravity information. In our work, we have obtained the accretion disk images of black hole from a universe earlier than ours, transported by a white hole within our universe, along with the positions and widths of these images exactly. Remarkably, behaviours of white hole and black hole imaging are similar in photon sphere and contrary to some cases of outside. This will provide valuable references for astronomical observations to validate quantum gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic times in Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time functions with asymptotically hyperbolic geometry play an increasingly important role in many areas of relativity, from computing black-hole perturbations to analyzing wave equations. Despite their significance, many of their properties remain underexplored. In this expository article, I discuss hyperbolic time functions by considering the hyperbola as the relativistic analog of a circle in two-dimensional Minkowski space and argue that suitably defined hyperboloidal coordinates are as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds. The presence of the null cone adds new elements to this analogy, particularly regarding the smooth foliation of the asymptotic boundary.</description>

      <title>Study of Decoupled Anisotropic Solutions in $f(R,T,R_{\rho\eta}T^{\rho\eta})$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider isotropic solution and extend it to two different exact well-behaved spherical anisotropic solutions through minimal geometric deformation method in $f(R,T,R_{\rho\eta}T^{\rho\eta})$ gravity. We only deform the radial metric component that separates the field equations into two sets corresponding to their original sources. The first set corresponds to perfect matter distribution while the other set exhibits the effects of additional source, i.e., anisotropy. The isotropic system is resolved by assuming the metric potentials proposed by Krori-Barua while the second set needs one constraint to be solved. The physical acceptability and consistency of the obtained solutions are analyzed through graphical analysis of effective matter components and energy bounds. We also examine mass, surface redshift and compactness of the resulting solutions. For particular values of the decoupling parameter, our both solutions turn out to be viable and stable. We conclude that this curvature-matter coupling gravity provides more stable solutions corresponding to a self-gravitating geometry.</description>

      <title>Cosmological study of a symmetric teleparallel gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a symmetric teleparallel gravity with a Lagrangian of logarithmic form. The full model leads to an accelerated universe and for specific values of the free parameters the Hubble rate reduces to the well-known Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, though the evolution of the gravitational potentials are different. We consider different branches of the logarithmic model, among which are self-accelerated branch and normal branch. The phenomenology of both the background and linear perturbations is discussed, including all the relevant effects on cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) angular power spectrum, lensing and matter power spectra. To this purpose, we modified the Einstein-Boltzmann code mgcamb. Finally, we derive bounds on the free parameters which are in agreement with early dark energy constraint from CMB and big bang nucleosynthesis constraint on the helium abundance.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Back-Linked Fabry-Perot Interferometer for the Space Gravitational Wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The back-linked Fabry-Perot interferometer (BLFPI) is an interferometer topology proposed for space gravitational wave antennas with the use of inter-satellite Fabry-Perot interferometers. The BLFPI offers simultaneous and independent control over all interferometer length degrees of freedom by controlling the laser frequencies. Therefore, BLFPI does not require an active control system for the physical lengths of the inter-satellite Fabry-Perot interferometers. To achieve a high sensitivity, the implementation must rely on an offline signal process for subtracting laser frequency noises. However, the subtraction has not been experimentally verified to date. This paper reports a demonstration of the frequency noise subtraction in the frequency band of 100 Hz-50 kHz, including the cavity pole frequency, using Fabry-Perot cavities with a length of 46 cm. The highest reduction ratio of approximately 200 was achieved. This marks the first experimental verification of the critical function in the BLFPI.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic decay and quasinormal frequencies of scalar and Dirac fields around dilaton-de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of Dirac and massive scalar fields at asymptotically late times in the background of the charged asymptotically de Sitter dilatonic black holes. It is shown that the asymptotic decay is exponential and oscillatory for large and intermediate mass of the field, while for zero and small mass it is pure exponential without oscillations. This reflects the dominance of quasinormal modes of the empty de Sitter spacetime at asymptotically late times. We also show that the earlier WKB calculation of the massive scalar field spectrum %[S. Fernando, Gen.Rel.Grav. 48 (2016) 3, 24] does not allow one to find the fundamental mode with reasonable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Hartle-Thorne formalism in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the Hartle-Thorne formalism for anisotropic pressure condition in Rastall gravity. As an implication, Tolman-Oppeneimer-Volkoff equation in anisotropic form is modified. The equations in anisotropic Hartle-Thorne formalism are also modified due to the appearance of $\lambda$, i.e. a constant that quantifies the deviation of Rastall gravity from general relativity. However, our results do not cover $\kappa\lambda=1/4$ and $\lambda=1/6$, since both would mathematically give singularity in the calculation.</description>

      <title>Particle Creation in a Linear Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Leonard Parker's pioneering 1968 work demonstrating matter quanta production in a dynamical spacetime background, we consider production of scalar quanta in a gravitational wave background. Choosing the spacetime to be a flat spacetime perturbed linearly by a spherical plane gravitational wave, we show that scalar particles may indeed be produced in a perturbative manner. Our formulation is valid for any linear gravitational wave background profile, and should generalize straightforwardly to production of massless elementary particles of diverse species (photons, neutrinos). In this aspect, irrespective of the astrophysical nature of the binary merger sourcing the gravitational wave signal, one expects the dynamical nature of the spacetime to produce all species of light particles. Thus, any binary coalescence is in effect a source of multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Making two particle detectors in flat spacetime communicate quantumly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A communication protocol with non-zero quantum capacity is found when the two communicating parts are particle detector models in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime. In particular, as detectors, we consider two harmonic oscillators interacting with a scalar field, whose evolution is generalized for whatever background spacetime and whatever spacetime smearing of the detectors. We then specialize to Minkowski spacetime and an initial Minkowski vacuum, considering a rapid interaction between the field and the two detectors, studying the case where the receiver is static and the sender is moving. The possibility to have a quantum capacity greater than zero stems from a relative acceleration between the detectors. Indeed, no reliable quantum communication is possible when the two detectors are static or moving inertially with respect to each other, but a reliable quantum communication can be achieved between a uniformly accelerated sender and an inertial receiver.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quark stars in $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity on the internal structure of compact stars, expecting this theory to manifest prominently in the high-density cores of such stars. In this study, we begin by considering the algebraic function $f(R,L_m,T) = R + \alpha T L_m$, where $\alpha$ represents the matter-geometry coupling constant. We specifically choose the matter Lagrangian density $L_m= -\rho$ to explore compact stars with anisotropic pressure. To this end, we employ the MIT bag model as an equation of state. We then numerically solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equations to obtain mass-radius relations for quark stars, examining static stability criteria, the adiabatic index, and the speed of sound. Finally, we use recent astrophysical data to constrain the coupling parameter $\alpha$, which may lead to either larger or smaller masses for quark stars compared to their counterparts in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend some basic results about marginally outer trapped surfaces to the context of surfaces having general null expansion. Motivated in part by recent work of Chai-Wan, we introduce the notion of $\mathfrak{g}$-stability for a general closed hypersurface $\Sigma$ in an ambient initial data set and prove that, under natural energy conditions, $\Sigma$ has positive Yamabe type, that is, $\Sigma$ admits a metric of positive scalar curvature, provided $\Sigma$ is $\mathfrak{g}$-stable. Similar results are obtained when $\Sigma$ is embedded in a spacelike, or null, hypersurface of a spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition. Conditions implying $\mathfrak{g}$-stability are also discussed. Finally, we obtain a spacetime positive mass theorem for initial data sets with compact boundary $\Sigma$ of positive null expansion, assuming that the dominant energy condition is sufficiently strict near $\Sigma$. This extends recent results of Galloway-Lee and Lee-Lesourd-Unger.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics in the solar system with tetrahedral spacecraft formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetrahedral configurations of spacecraft on unperturbed heliocentric orbits allow for highly precise observations of small spatial changes in the gravitational field, especially those affecting the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The resulting high sensitivity may be used to search for new physics that could manifest itself via deviations from general relativistic behavior yielding a non-vanishing trace[GGT]. We study the feasibility of recovering the trace[GGT] with the sensitivity of O(1e-24 s^(-2)) -- the level where some of the recently proposed cosmological models may have observable effects in the solar system. We consider how local measurements provided by precision laser ranging and atom-wave interferometry can be used for that purpose. We report on a preliminary study of such an experiment and precision that may be reached in measuring the trace[GGT], with the assumption of drag-compensated spacecraft by atom interferometer measurements. For that, we study the dynamical behavior of a tetrahedral formation established by four spacecraft on heliocentric nearby elliptical orbits. We formulate the observational equations to measure the trace[GGT] relying only on the observables available within the formation: laser ranging and the Sagnac interferometry. We demonstrate that Sagnac observable is a mission enabling and allows to measure the angular frequency of the tetrahedral rotation with respect to an inertial reference frame with an accuracy much higher than that available from any other modern navigational techniques. We show that the quality of the science measurements is affected by the changes in tetrahedron's orientation and shape as spacecraft follow their orbits. We present the preliminary mission and instrument requirements needed to measure the trace[GGT] to the required accuracy and demonstrate the feasibility of satisfying the science objectives.</description>

      <title>Solution to the cosmological constant problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose an observationally and theoretically consistent resolution of the cosmological constant problem: $\Lambda$ is a counterterm - with a running coupling - that balances the monopole celestial sky average of the kinetic energy of expansion of inhomogeneously distributed `small' cosmic voids. No other dark energy source is required. This solution relies on the first investigation of void statistics in cosmological simulations in full general relativity (arXiv:2403.15134). Results are consistent with parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction. Crucially, dynamical spatial curvature arises as time-varying spatial gradients of the kinetic spatial curvature, and depends directly on the void volume fraction. Its monopole average generates the cosmological term. This result potentially resolves the Hubble tension and offers new approaches to tackling other tensions and anomalies.</description>

      <title>Repeating Nuclear Transients as Candidate Electromagnetic Counterparts of LISA Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the primary targets for the recently adopted millihertz gravitational-wave (GW) observatory LISA. Some previous studies have argued that a fraction of all EMRIs form in matter-rich environments, and can potentially explain the dozens of soft X-ray band ($\sim 10^{-1} \rm keV$), low-frequency ($\sim 0.1$ mHz) periodic phenomena known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Here, using a representative EMRI population retrofitted with cutoffs on LISA-band SNRs and luminosity distances to account for the sensitivity of current instruments, we estimate the mean frequency band in which QPEs and QPOs originating from detectable LISA EMRIs may be emitting an X-ray signal ``today'' (i.e., in 2024) to be $0.46 \pm 0.22$ mHz. We also model the well-known QPO source, RE J1034+396, which falls in this frequency band, as an EMRI assuming its primary black hole mass to be $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$. Through a prior-predictive analysis, we estimate the orbiting compact object's mass to be $46^{+ 10}_{-40} M_\odot$ and the source's LISA-band SNR as $\approx 14$, highlighting it as a candidate multi-messenger EMRI target. We also highlight the role of current and near-future X-ray and UV observatories in enabling multi-messenger observations of EMRIs in conjunction with LISA, and conclude with a discussion of caveats of the current analysis, such as the exclusion of eccentricity and inclination from the model, and the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Covariant Guiding Center Equations for Charged Particle Motions in General Relativistic Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low density plasmas in curved spacetimes, such as those found in accretion flows around black holes, are challenging to model from first principles, owing to the large scale separation between the characteristic scales of the microscopic processes and large mean-free-paths comparable to the system sizes. Kinetic approaches become necessary to capture the relevant physics but lack the dynamic range to model the global characteristics of the systems. In this paper, we develop new covariant guiding center equations of motion for charges in general relativistic spacetimes that are computationally tractable. We decompose the particle motion into a fast gyration, which we integrate analytically and a slow drift of the guiding center, which can be solved numerically. We derive covariant conservation laws for the motions of the guiding centers and show, through a number of limiting cases, that the equations contain all known drift mechanisms. Finally, we present the general relativistic expressions for the various drift velocities in Schwarzschild spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation tracking the magnetosphere of a collapsing magnetar. The collapse is expected for massive rotating magnetars formed in merger events, and it may occur many hours after the merger. The results suggest a novel gamma-ray burst (GRB) scenario, which creates a delayed high- energy counterpart of the merger gravitational waves. The collapse launches an outgoing magnetospheric shock, and a hot magnetized outflow forms behind the shock. The outflow is modulated by the ring-down of the nascent black hole, imprinting its kilohertz quasi-normal modes on the GRB tail.</description>

      <title>Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles are described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry and find that the stochastic effect will only diminish the performance of the detector marginally, unlike searches in other contexts where significant reductions are found. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of detector network in two typical configurations. We find that the well-separated configuration, where the distance between two detectors exceeds the coherence length of dark matter, is the optimal choice for ultralight dark matter detection due to a less chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the co-located and co-aligned configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving gravitational-wave detectors like LISA, Taiji and TianQin.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>Testing Yukawa cosmology at the Milky Way and M31 galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the galaxy rotation curves through the Yukawa gravitational potential emerging as a correction of the Newtonian potential in extended theories of gravity. On the one hand, we consider the contribution of the galactic bulge, galactic disk, and the dark matter halo of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. On the other hand, we use modified Yukawa gravity to show that the rotational velocity of galaxies can be addressed successfully without the need for dark matter. In Yukawa gravity, we recover MOND and show that dark matter might be seen as an apparent effect due to the modification of the law of gravitation in terms of two parameters: the coupling constant $\alpha $ and the characteristic length $\lambda$. We thus test our theoretical scenario using the Milky Way and M31 rotation velocity curves. In particular, we place observational constraints on the free parameters of Yukawa cosmology through the Monte Carlo method and then compare our results with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by making use of Bayesian information criteria. Specifically, we find that $\lambda$ is constrained to be of the order of kpc, while cosmological data suggest $\lambda$ of the order of Gpc. To explain this discrepancy, we argue that there is a fundamental limitation in measuring $\lambda$ due to the role of quantum mechanics on cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider some basic problems associated with quantum mechanics of systems having a time-dependent Hilbert space. We provide a consistent treatment of these systems and address the possibility of describing them in terms of a time-independent Hilbert space. We show that in general the Hamiltonian operator does not represent an observable of the system even if it is a self-adjoint operator. This is related to a hidden geometric aspect of quantum mechanics arising from the presence of an operator-valued gauge potential. We also offer a careful treatment of quantum systems whose Hilbert space is obtained by endowing a time-independent vector space with a time-dependent inner product.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach to detecting (linear) gravitational wave memory in a Galactic core-collapse supernova using current interferometers. Gravitational wave memory is an important prediction of general relativity that has yet to be confirmed. Our approach uses a combination of Linear Prediction Filtering and Matched-Filtering. We present the results of our approach on data from core-collapse supernova simulations that span a range of progenitor mass and metallicity. We are able to detect gravitational wave memory out to 10 kpc. We also present the False Alarm Probabilities assuming an On-Source Window compatible with the presence of a neutrino detection.</description>

Abstract: We show how to encode the radiative degrees of freedom in $4$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, using the boundary Cotton and stress tensors. Background radiation leads to a reduction of the asymptotic symmetry group, in contrast to asymptotically flat spacetimes, where a non-vanishing news tensor does not restrict the asymptotic symmetries. Null gauges, such as $\Lambda$-BMS, provide a framework for AdS spacetimes that include radiation in the flat limit. We use this to check that the flat limit of the radiative data matches the expected definition in intrinsically asymptotically flat spacetimes. We further dimensionally reduce our construction to the celestial sphere, and show how the $2$-dimensional celestial currents can be extracted from the $3$-dimensional boundary data.</description>

Abstract: Redshift drift is the phenomenon whereby the observed redshift between an emitter and observer comoving with the Hubble flow in an expanding FLRW universe will slowly evolve -- on a timescale comparable to the Hubble time. In a previous article [JCAP 04 (2020) 043; arXiv 2001.11964] three of the current authors had performed a cosmographic analysis of the redshift drift in a FLRW universe, temporarily putting aside the issue of dynamics (the Friedmann equations). In the current article we now add dynamics, still within the framework of an exact FLRW universe. We shall develop a suitable generic matter model and apply it to both standard FLRW and various dark energy models. Furthermore, we shall also present a section analyzing the utility of using alternative cosmographic variables to describe the redshift drift data.</description>

Abstract: Colliding or noncolliding plane fronted electromagnetic or gravitational waves are the asymptotic limit of Robinson--Trautman spherical electromagnetic or gravitational waves. Noncolliding plane fronted waves contain no information about their sources whereas colliding waves contain information about possibly the motion of their sources. As a first step to investigate the latter phenomenon we construct an asymptotic limit of Li\'enard--Wiechert electromagnetic fields in the context of Minkowskian space--time. This has the advantage that the source is well known and the calculations can be carried out in full detail. The final result is an algebraically general Maxwell field which consists of colliding plane fronted waves in a subregion of Minkowskian space--time and an interesting byproduct is a novel perspective on a Maxwell field originally discovered by Bateman.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we build a thin-shell gravastar model within a noncommutative BTZ geometry. For this, we consider a noncommutative BTZ metric in the inner region and a geometry associated with a BTZ solution in the outer region, joined by the generalized join technique. After investigating the inner spacetime, surface and outer spacetime, we observe that there is a surface energy density and surface pressure, such as to make gravastar stable. This effect persists even when the cosmological constant is zero. Besides, we found a bound for the noncommutativity parameter. In addition, we examine the thermodynamics of the noncommutative BTZ black hole in Schwarzschildtype form in three-dimensional spacetime. We also check the stability condition by calculating the specific heat capacity.</description>

Abstract: We show that the stress tensor of a real scalar quantum field on Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter spacetime exhibits correlations over macroscopic distances near the Cauchy horizon. These diverge as the Cauchy horizon is approached and are universal, i.e., state-independent. This signals a breakdown of the semi-classical approximation near the Cauchy horizon. We also investigate the effect of turning on a charge of the scalar field and consider the correlation of the stress tensor between the two poles of the Cauchy horizon of Kerr-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background generated by black hole-black hole (BH-BH) hyperbolic encounters with eccentricities close to one and compare them with the respective sensitivity curves of planned GW detectors. We use the Keplerian potential to model the orbits of the encounters and the quadrupole formula to compute the emitted GWs. We take into account hyperbolic encounters that take place in clusters up to redshift $5$ and with BH masses spanning from $5 M_{\odot}$ to $55 M_{\odot}$. We assume the clusters to be virialized and study several cluster models with different mass and virial velocity, and finally obtain an accumulative result, displaying the background as an average. Using the maxima and minima of our accumulative result for each frequency, we provide analytical expressions for both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Our results suggest that the background from these encounters is likely to be detected by the third-generation detectors Cosmic explorer and Einstein telescope, while the tail section at lower frequencies intersects with DECIGO, making it a potential target source for both ground- and space-based future GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Multipoles in Five Dimensions</title>

Abstract: We define gravitational mass and current multipoles for five-dimensional, stationary, and asymptotically flat vacuum metrics. We do this by generalizing Thorne's asymptotically Cartesian and mass-centered (ACMC) coordinate formalism to five dimensions, and prove that the multipoles defined in this way are unambiguously well-defined. Further, these two towers of multipole tensors, in the case of biaxial symmetry, reduce to a tower of mass multipoles $M_\ell$, and two separate towers of current or angular momentum multipoles $S^{(1)}_\ell, S^{(2)}_\ell$. We apply our formalism to a few examples, in particular Myers-Perry black holes, black rings, and smooth multicentered geometries.</description>

      <title>Generating New Spacetimes through Zermelo Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zermelo navigation is not only a fundamental tool in Finsler geometry but also a fundamental approach to the geometrization of dynamics in physics. In this paper, we consider the Zermelo navigation problem on optical Riemannian space and, via Zermelo/Randers/spacetime triangle, explore the generation of new spacetimes from pre-existing ones. Whether the Randers metric has reversible geodesics corresponds to the presence of time-reversal symmetry in the generated spacetime. In cases where the Randers metric has reversible geodesics, we utilize a radial vector field to generate new static spacetimes from existing ones. For example, we can generate Schwarzschild, Rindler, de Sitter, and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes from flat spacetime. In fact, the Zermelo navigation method allows for the derivation of a variety of static spacetimes from flat spacetime. For multi-parameter spacetimes, they can be generated through various navigation paths. However, for some spacetimes, not all navigation paths may exist. In the second scenario, when the Randers metric does not have reversible geodesics, we employ a rotational vector field to transform non-flat static metrics into slowly rotating spacetimes. Alternatively, using a mixed vector field, we generate slowly rotating spacetimes starting from flat spacetime. We provide examples of generating Kerr spacetimes and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Oscillations in an Expanding Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the Gertsenshtein effect, the presence of a large external B-field may allow photons and gravitons to mix in a way that resembles neutrino oscillations and is even more similar to axion-photon mixing. Assuming a background B-field (or any field that behaves like one), we examine the Gertsenshtein mechanism in the context of FLRW expanding universe models, as well as de Sitter space. The conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations and the conformal noninvariance of the Einstein equations preclude the operation of the Gertsenshtein effect at all scales. In general we find for the matter- and radiation-dominated cases, graviton-oscillations are possible only at late conformal times or when the wavelengths are much shorter than the horizon ($k\eta \gg 1$), but that the time-dependent oscillations eventually damp out in any case. The presence of charged particles additionally damps out the oscillations. For the de Sitter universe, we find that oscillations are possible only at early conformal times ($\eta \ll H^{-1}$) and for wavelengths short compared to the Hubble radius, but eventually freeze in when wavelengths become longer than the Hubble radius. In principle a Gertsenshtein-like mechanism might influence the balance of particle species in an inflationary phase before freezing in; however, we find that in all our models the mixing length is larger than the Hubble radius. We discuss several possible remedies to this situation.</description>

      <title>Particle dynamics in spherically symmetric electro-vacuum instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geodesic motion in spherically symmetric electro-vacuum Euclidean solutions of the Einstein equation. There are two kinds of such solutions: the Euclidean Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (ERN) metrics, and the Bertotti-Robinson-like (BR) metrics, the latter having constant Kretschmann scalar. First, we derive the motion equations for the ERN spacetime and we generalize the results of Battista-Esposito, showing that all orbits in as ERN spacetime are unbounded if and only if it has an event horizon. We also obtain the Weierstrass form of the polar radial motion, providing an efficient tool for numerical computations. We then study the angular deflection of orbits in the Euclidean Schwarzschild spacetime which, in contrast to the Lorentzian background, can be either positive or negative. We observe the presence of a null and a maximal deflection rings for particles with velocity at infinity $v&gt;1$ and we give approximate values for their size when $v\gtrsim1$. For BR spacetimes, we obtain analytic solutions for the radial motion in proper length, involving (hyperbolic) trigonometric functions and we deduce that orbits either exponentially go to the singularity or are periodic. Finally, we apply the previous results and use algorithms related to Weierstrass' elliptic functions to produce a Python code to plot orbits of the spacetimes ERN and BR, and draw "shadows" of the first ones, as it was already done before for classical black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the caustic point developed by outgoing null hypersurfaces and the behavior of null curves. We analyze three cases: Future, past, and zero caustic point terminology for outgoing null hypersurfaces in the marginally bound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric for homogenous and inhomogeneous cases defined in the present work. We show the criteria to form local and globally visible singularity in terms of the tangent on the apparent horizon curve.</description>

Abstract: In the era of gravitational waves physics, when detections of wave fronts are increasing in number, sensibility, frequencies and distances, gravitational physics has entered a period of maximum activity and brilliance. This has open a new window where General Relativity can be challenged in both weak as strong-field regimes. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of gravitational waves propagation and emission in the weak-field regime for gravitational theories within the Palatini formalism. Our results show that gravitational waves propagation in vacuum matches General Relativity predictions as well as the multipolar expansion when considering weak sources, independently of the form of the gravitational action.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of Rotating compact objects in Plasma space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the characteristics of shadows cast by the Kerr black hole in the presence of plasma and compared them to those of a rotating wormhole in a uniform plasma space-time for an observer at infinity. Interestingly, for the same uniform plasma density, the apparent shadow size of the rotating wormhole is always greater than that of the Kerr black hole. To further distinguish the two compact objects we studied the deflection angle and did a comparative study in the presence of the uniform and non-uniform plasma profiles. The goal of this whole exercise is to deepen our understanding of the observational phenomena of these astrophysical objects. The analysis reveals the importance of specific plasma distribution profiles, the impact of plasma on the shadow diameter, and the behavior of deflection angles in different plasma scenarios. We have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters by considering observational data and employing analytical formulations. Our work therefore provides valuable insights into the behavior of light rays near compact objects in plasma space-time.</description>

      <title>Smoothing and flattening the universe through slow contraction versus inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a systematic study, we use an equivalent pair of improved numerical relativity codes based on a tetrad-formulation of the classical Einstein-scalar field equations to examine whether slow contraction or inflation (or both) can resolve the homogeneity, isotropy and flatness problems. Our finding, based on a set of gauge/frame invariant diagnostics, is that slow contraction robustly and rapidly smooths and flattens spacetime beginning from initial conditions that are outside the perturbative regime of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, whereas inflation fails these tests. We present new numerical evidence supporting the conjecture that the combination of ultralocal evolution and an effective equation-of-state with pressure much greater than energy density is the key to having robust and rapid smoothing. The opposite of ultralocality occurs in expanding spacetimes, which is the leading obstruction to smoothing following a big bang.</description>

      <title>Evidence for 3XMM J185246.6+003317 as a massive magnetar with a low magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is a transient magnetar located in the vicinity of the supernova remnant Kes\,79. So far, observations have only set upper limits to its surface magnetic field and spindown, and there is no estimate for its mass and radius. Using ray-tracing modelling and Bayesian inference for the analysis of several light curves spanning a period of around three weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars to date. In addition, our analysis suggests a multipolar magnetic field structure with a subcritical field strength and a carbon atmosphere composition. Due to the time-resolution limitation of the available light curves, we estimate the surface magnetic field and the mass to be $\log_{10} (B/{\rm G}) = 11.89^{+0.19}_{-0.93}$ and $M=2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$~$M_{\odot}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the radius is estimated to be $R=12.02^{+1.44}_{-1.42}$ km at $2\sigma$ confidence level. They were verified by simulations, i.e., data injections with known model parameters, and their subsequent recovery. The best-fitting model has three small hot spots, two of them in the southern hemisphere. These are, however, just first estimates and conclusions, based on a simple ray-tracing model with anisotropic emission; we also estimate the impact of modelling on the parameter uncertainties and the relevant phenomena on which to focus in more precise analyses. We interpret the above best-fitting results as due to accretion of supernova layers/interstellar medium onto 3XMM J185246.6+003317 leading to burying and a subsequent re-emergence of the magnetic field, and a carbon atmosphere being formed possibly due to hydrogen/helium diffusive nuclear burning. Finally, we briefly discuss some consequences of our findings for superdense matter constraints.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Islands from Hilbert Space Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a mechanism to generate entanglement islands in quantum systems from a purely quantum information perspective. More explicitly we show that, if we impose certain constraints on a quantum system by projecting out certain states in the Hilbert space, it is possible that for all the states remaining in the reduced Hilbert space, there exits subsets $I_a$ whose states are encoded in the states of another subset $\mathcal{R}_a$. Then the subsets $\{I_a\}$ are just the entanglement islands of the corresponding subsets $\{\mathcal{R}_a\}$. We call such a system self-encoded, and find that the entanglement entropy in such systems should be calculated by a new island formula. We give a comparison between our new island formula and island formula in gravitational theories. Inspired by our mechanism, we propose a simulation of the AdS/BCFT correspondence and the island phases in this context via a holographic CFT$_2$ with a special Weyl transformation.</description>

      <title>3-point function of currents for holographic cosmology and monopole non-Gaussianities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the calculation of the three-point function in momentum space of currents for a $SO(3)$ global symmetry, in a three-dimensional toy model within phenomenological holographic cosmology. Since the two-point function gives, via electric-magnetic duality, the resolution of the cosmological monopole problem, the three-point function is related to the monopole non-Gaussianities. We check that the final result is UV and IR finite and satisfies the transverse Ward identities and consider the $k_1\ll k_2,k_3$ case, relevant for cosmology. We also show that the two-loop result for the 3-point function is completely independent of the explicit form of the potential, meaning that, like the solution to the monopole problem, also the non-Gaussianities are universal within the phenomenological holographic cosmology.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies in Scalar-Induced Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflaton-Curvaton Mixed Scenario with Sound Speed Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model to generate large anisotropies in the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background via sound speed resonance in the inflaton-curvaton mixed scenario. Cosmological curvature perturbations are not only exponentially amplified at a resonant frequency, but also preserve significant non-Gaussianity of local type described by $f_{\mathrm{nl}}$. Besides a significant enhancement of energy-density fraction spectrum, large anisotropies in SIGWs can be generated, because of super-horizon modulations of the energy density due to existence of primordial non-Gaussianity. A reduced angular power spectrum $\tilde{C}_{\ell}$ could reach an amplitude of $[\ell(\ell+1)\tilde{C}_{\ell}]^{1/2} \sim 10^{-2}$, leading to potential measurements via planned gravitational-wave detectors such as DECIGO. The large anisotropies in SIGWs would serve as a powerful probe of the early universe, shedding new light on the inflationary dynamics, primordial non-Gaussianity, and primordial black hole dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Strominger-Thompson quantum Bousso bound in the infinite class of conformal vacua in semiclassical JT gravity, with postive or negative cosmological constant. The Bousso-Fisher-Leichenauer-Wall quantum Bousso bound follows from an analogous derivation, requiring only initial quantum non-expansion. In this process, we show that the quantity ${2\pi k^{\mu}k^{\nu}&lt;:T_{\mu\nu}:&gt;-S''-\frac{6}{c}(S')^2}$ vanishes in any vacuum state, entailing a stronger version of Wall's quantum null energy condition. We derive an entropy formula in the presence of a generic class of two reflecting boundaries, in order to apply our argument to the half reduction model of de Sitter JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Mixmaster chaos in an AdS black hole interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive gravitational backgrounds that are asymptotically Anti-de Sitter, have a regular black hole horizon and which deep in the interior exhibit mixmaster chaotic dynamics. The solutions are obtained by coupling gravity with a negative cosmological constant to three massive vector fields, within an Ansatz that reduces to ordinary differential equations. At late interior times the equations are identical to those analysed in depth by Misner and by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz fifty years ago. We review and extend known classical and semiclassical results on the interior chaos, formulated as both a dynamical system of `Kasner eras' and as a hyperbolic billiards problem. The volume of the universe collapses doubly-exponentially over each Kasner era. A remarkable feature is the emergence of a conserved energy, and hence a `time-independent' Hamiltonian, at asymptotically late interior times. A quantisation of this Hamiltonian exhibits arithmetic chaos associated with the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$ of the modular group. We compute a large number of eigenvalues numerically to obtain the spectral form factor. While the spectral statistics is anomalous for a chaotic system, the eigenfunctions themselves display random matrix behaviour.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity: braneworld gravity versus the Lloyd bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the complexity equals volume proposal for planar black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime in 2+1 dimensions, with an end of the world (ETW) brane behind the horizon. We allow for the possibility of intrinsic gravitational dynamics in the form of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to be localized on the brane. We compute the asymptotic rate of change of volume complexity analytically and obtain the full time dependence using numerical techniques. We find that the inclusion of JT gravity on the brane leads to interesting effects on time dependence of holographic complexity. We identify the region in parameter space (the brane location and the JT coupling) for which the rate of change of complexity violates the Lloyd bound. In an equivalent description of the model in terms of an asymptotically AdS wormhole, we connect the violation of the Lloyd bound to the violation of a suitable energy condition in the bulk that we introduce. We also compare the Lloyd bound constraints to previously derived constraints on the bulk parameters in this model that are based on bounds on entanglement growth in the dual CFT state.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a cosmological bubble wall beyond the approximation of an infinitely thin wall. In a previous paper, we discussed the range of validity of this approximation and estimated the first-order corrections due to the finite width. Here, we introduce a systematic method to obtain the wall equation of motion and its profile at each order in the wall width. We discuss in detail the next-to-next-to-leading-order terms. We use the results to treat the growth of spherical bubbles and the evolution of small deformations of planar walls.</description>

      <title>An efficient prescription to search for linear gravitational wave memory in pulsar timing array data and its application to the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset</title>

Abstract: Burst with memory events are potential transient gravitational wave sources for the maturing pulsar timing array (PTA) efforts. We provide a computationally efficient prescription to model pulsar timing residuals induced by supermassive black hole pairs in general relativistic hyperbolic trajectories employing a Keplerian-type parametric solution. Injection studies have been pursued on the resulting bursts with linear GW memory (LGWM) events with simulated datasets to test the performance of our pipeline, followed by its application to the publicly available NANOGrav 12.5-year (NG12.5) dataset. Given the absence of any evidence of LGWM events within the real NG12.5 dataset, we impose 95\% upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude as a function of the sky location of the source and certain characteristic frequency ($n$) of the signal. The upper limits are computed using a signal model that takes into account the presence of intrinsic timing noise specific to each pulsar, as well as a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise, alongside the LGWM signal. Our investigations reveal that the $95\%$ upper limits on LGWM amplitude, marginalized over all other parameters, is 3.48 $\pm 0.51 \ \mu$s for $n&gt;3.16$ nHz. This effort should be relevant for constraining both burst and memory events in the upcoming International Pulsar Timing Array data releases.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Marchenko-Pastur Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal eigenvalue distribution characterizing the Gram matrix of semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>
