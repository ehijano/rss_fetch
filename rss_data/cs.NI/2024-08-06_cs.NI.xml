      <title>An Agile Adaptation Method for Multi-mode Vehicle Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on discovering the impact of communication mode allocation on communication efficiency in the vehicle communication networks. To be specific, Markov decision process and reinforcement learning are applied to establish an agile adaptation mechanism for multi-mode communication devices according to the driving scenarios and business requirements. Then, Q-learning is used to train the agile adaptation reinforcement learning model and output the trained model. By learning the best actions to take in different states to maximize the cumulative reward, and avoiding the problem of poor adaptation effect caused by inaccurate delay measurement in unstable communication scenarios. The experiments show that the proposed scheme can quickly adapt to dynamic vehicle networking environment, while achieving high concurrency and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>MAC Address De-Randomization Using Multi-Channel Sniffers and Two-Stage Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAC randomization is a widely used technique implemented on most modern smartphones to protect user's privacy against tracking based on Probe Request frames capture. However, there exist weaknesses in such a methodology which may still expose distinctive information, allowing to track the device generating the Probe Requests. Such techniques, known as MAC de-randomization algorithms, generally exploit Information Elements (IEs) contained in the Probe Requests and use clustering methodologies to group together frames belonging to the same device. While effective on heterogeneous device types, such techniques are not able to differentiate among devices of identical type and running the same Operating System (OS). In this paper, we propose a MAC de-randomization technique able to overcome such a weakness. First, we propose a new dataset of Probe Requests captured from devices sharing the same characteristics. Secondly, we observe that the time-frequency pattern of Probe Request emission is unique among devices and can therefore be used as a discriminative feature. We embed such a feature in a two-stage clustering methodology and show through experiments its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art techniques based solely on IEs fingerprinting. The original dataset used in this work is made publicly available for reproducible research.</description>

      <title>KTWIN: A Serverless Kubernetes-based Digital Twin Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) systems are virtual representations of physical assets allowing organizations to gain insights and improve existing processes. In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.</description>

      <title>MoleNetwork: A tool for the generation of synthetic optical network topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model networks and their underlying topologies have been used as a reference for techno-economic studies for several decades. Existing reference topologies for optical networks may cover different network segments such as backbone, metro core, metro aggregation, access and/or data center. While telco operators work on the optimization of their own existing deployed optical networks, the availability of different topologies is useful for researchers and technology developers to test their solutions in a variety of scenarios and validate the performance in terms of energy efficiency or cost reduction. This paper presents an open-source tool, MoleNetwork, to generate graphs inspired by real network topologies of telecommunication operators that can be used as benchmarks for techno-economic studies.</description>

      <title>Implementing NAT Hole Punching with QUIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Network Address Translation (NAT) technology has led to a significant number of network end nodes being located in private networks behind NAT devices, impeding direct communication between these nodes. To solve this problem, a technique known as "hole punching" has been devised for NAT traversal to facilitate peer-to-peer communication among end nodes located in distinct private networks. However, as the increasing demands for speed and security in networks, TCP-based hole punching schemes gradually show performance drawbacks. Therefore, we present a QUIC-based hole punching scheme for NAT traversal. Through a comparative analysis of the hole punching time between QUIC-based and TCP based protocols, we find that the QUIC-based scheme effectively reduces the hole punching time, exhibiting a pronounced advantage in weak network environments. Furthermore, in scenarios where the hole punched connection is disrupted due to factors such as network transitions or NAT timeouts, this paper evaluates two schemes for restoring the connection: QUIC connection migration and re-punching. Our results show that QUIC connection migration for connection restoration saves 2 RTTs compared to QUIC re-punching, and 3 RTTs compared to TCP re-punching, effectively reducing the computational resources consumption for re-punching.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Integration of the Virtualization of Network Functions in the Context of Information Centric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the new network architectures with respect to the traditional network topologies must manage more data, which entails having increasingly robust and scalable network structures. As there is a process of growth, adaptability, and change in traditional data networks, faced with the management of large volumes of information, it is necessary to incorporate the virtualization of network functions in the context of information content networks, in such a way that there is a balance between the user and the provider at cost level and profit, the functions on the network. In turn, NFVs (Network Functions Virtualization) are considered network structures designed based on IT virtualization technologies, which allow virtualizing of the functions that can be found in the network nodes, which are connected through routing tables, which allows offering communication services for various types of customers. Therefore, information-centric networks (IC, unlike traditional data networks which proceed to exchange information between hosts using data packets and TCP/IP communication protocols, use the content of the data for this purpose where the data travels through the network is stored in a routing table located in the CR (Content Router) of the router temporality to be reused later, which allows for reducing operation costs and capital costs . The purpose of this work is to analyze how the virtualization of network functions is integrated into the field of information-centric networks. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of both architectures are considered and presented as a critical analysis when considering the current difficulties and future trends of both network topologies.</description>

      <title>Shaping Rewards, Shaping Routes: On Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks for Routing in Satellite Constellation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective routing in satellite mega-constellations has become crucial to facilitate the handling of increasing traffic loads, more complex network architectures, as well as the integration into 6G networks. To enhance adaptability as well as robustness to unpredictable traffic demands, and to solve dynamic routing environments efficiently, machine learning-based solutions are being considered. For network control problems, such as optimizing packet forwarding decisions according to Quality of Service requirements and maintaining network stability, deep reinforcement learning techniques have demonstrated promising results. For this reason, we investigate the viability of multi-agent deep Q-networks for routing in satellite constellation networks. We focus specifically on reward shaping and quantifying training convergence for joint optimization of latency and load balancing in static and dynamic scenarios. To address identified drawbacks, we propose a novel hybrid solution based on centralized learning and decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization for Computation Offloading in Aerial Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid increment of multiple users for data offloading and computation, it is challenging to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) in remote areas. To deal with the challenge, it is promising to combine aerial access networks (AANs) with multi-access edge computing (MEC) equipments to provide computation services with high QoS. However, as for uncertain data sizes of tasks, it is intractable to optimize the offloading decisions and the aerial resources. Hence, in this paper, we consider the AAN to provide MEC services for uncertain tasks. Specifically, we construct the uncertainty sets based on historical data to characterize the possible probability distribution of the uncertain tasks. Then, based on the constructed uncertainty sets, we formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem to minimize the system delay. Next,we relax the problem and reformulate it into a linear programming problem. Accordingly, we design a MEC-based distributionally robust latency optimization algorithm. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves a superior balance between reducing system latency and minimizing energy consumption, as compared to other benchmark mechanisms in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>A Demand-aware Networked System Using Telemetry and ML with ReactNET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging network applications ranging from video streaming to virtual/augmented reality need to provide stringent quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees in complex and dynamic environments with shared resources. A promising approach to meeting these requirements is to automate complex network operations and create self-adjusting networks. These networks should automatically gather contextual information, analyze how to efficiently ensure QoS requirements, and adapt accordingly. This paper presents ReactNET, a self-adjusting networked system designed to achieve this vision by leveraging emerging network programmability and machine learning techniques. Programmability empowers ReactNET by providing fine-grained telemetry information, while machine learning-based classification techniques enable the system to learn and adjust the network to changing conditions. Our preliminary implementation of ReactNET in P4 and Python demonstrates its effectiveness in video streaming applications.</description>

      <title>Demystifying AMD SEV Performance Penalty for NFV Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has shifted communication networks towards more adaptable software solutions, but this transition raises new security concerns, particularly in public cloud deployments. While Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) offers a potential remedy, it requires complex application adaptations. This paper investigates AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) as an alternative approach for securing NFV. SEV encrypts virtual machine (VM) memory, protecting it from threats, including those at the hypervisor level, without requiring application modifications. We explore the practicality and performance implications of executing native network function (NF) implementations in AMD SEV-SNP, the latest iteration of SEV. Our study focuses on running an unmodified Snort NF within SEV. Results show an average performance penalty of approximately 20% across various traffic and packet configurations, demonstrating a trade-off between security and performance that may be acceptable for many NFV deployments.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are currently considered for adoption in future 6G stantards. ETSI and 3GPP have started feasibility and performance investigations of such a technology. This work proposes an analytical model to analyze RIS performance. It relies on a simple street model where obstacles and mobile units are all aligned. RIS is positioned onto a building parallel to the road. The coverage probability in presence of obstacles and concurrent communications is then computed as a performance criteria.</description>

      <title>Image Generative Semantic Communication with Multi-Modal Similarity Estimation for Resource-Limited Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To reduce network traffic and support environments with limited resources, a method for transmitting images with minimal transmission data is required. Several machine learning-based image compression methods, which compress the data size of images while maintaining their features, have been proposed. However, in certain situations, reconstructing only the semantic information of images at the receiver end may be sufficient. To realize this concept, semantic-information-based communication, called semantic communication, has been proposed, along with an image transmission method using semantic communication. This method transmits only the semantic information of an image, and the receiver reconstructs it using an image-generation model. This method utilizes a single type of semantic information for image reconstruction, but reconstructing images similar to the original image using only this information is challenging. This study proposes a multi-modal image transmission method that leverages various types of semantic information for efficient semantic communication. The proposed method extracts multi-modal semantic information from an original image and transmits only that to a receiver. Subsequently, the receiver generates multiple images using an image-generation model and selects an output image based on semantic similarity. The receiver must select the result based only on the received features; however, evaluating the similarity using conventional metrics is challenging. Therefore, this study explores new metrics to evaluate the similarity between semantic features of images and proposes two scoring procedures for evaluating semantic similarity between images based on multiple semantic features. The results indicate that the proposed procedures can compare semantic similarities, such as position and composition, between the semantic features of the original and generated images.</description>

      <title>Managing O-RAN Networks: xApp Development from Zero to Hero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance proposes an open architecture that disaggregates the RAN and supports executing custom control logic in near-real time from third-party applications, the xApps. Despite O-RAN's efforts, the creation of xApps remains a complex and time-consuming endeavor, aggravated by the sometimes fragmented, outdated, or deprecated documentation from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC). These challenges hinder academia and industry from developing and validating solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks. This tutorial addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive guide for developing xApps to manage the O-RAN ecosystem from theory to practice. We provide a thorough theoretical foundation of the O-RAN architecture and detail the functionality offered by Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) components. We examine the xApp design and configuration. We explore the xApp lifecycle and demonstrate how to deploy and manage xApps on a Near-RT RIC. We address the xApps' interfaces and capabilities, accompanied by practical examples. We provide comprehensive details on how xApps can control the RAN. We discuss debugging strategies and good practices to aid the xApp developers in testing their xApps. Finally, we review the current landscape and open challenges for creating xApps.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling 5G-NTN Satellite Communications for Manned and Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite Communications (SatCom) are a backbone of worldwide development. In contrast with the past, when the GEO satellites were the only means for such connectivity, nowadays the multi-orbital connectivity is emerging, especially with the use of satellite constellations. Simultaneously, SatCom enabled the so-called In-Flight Connectivity, while with the advent of 5G-NTN, the development of this market is being accelerated. However, there are still various missing points before such a technology becomes mainstream, especially in the case of Rotary Wing Aircraft (RWA). Indeed, due to their particular characteristics, such as the low altitude flights and the blade interference, there are still open challenges. In this work, an End-to-End (E2E) analysis for the performance of SatCom under 5G-NTN for manned and unmanned RWA is performed. Various scenarios are examined, and related requirements are shown. The effects of blades and other characteristics of the RWA are established, and simulations for these cases are developed. Results along with related discussion are presented, while future directions for development are suggested. This work is part of the ESA ACROSS-AIR project.</description>

      <title>Nomadic Non-Public Networks for 6G: Use Cases and Key Performance Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of wireless communication systems is evolving rapidly, with a pivotal role envisioned for dynamic network structures and self-organizing networks in upcoming technologies like the 6G mobile communications standard. This evolution is fueled by the growing demand from diverse sectors, including industry, manufacturing, agriculture, and the public sector, each with increasingly specific requirements. The establishment of non-public networks in the current 5G standard has laid a foundation, enabling independent operation within certain frequencies and local limitations, notably for Internet of Things applications. This paper explores the progression from non-public networks to nomadic non-public networks and their significance in the context of the forthcoming 6G era.
  Building on existing work in dynamic network structures, non-public networks regulations, and alternative technological solutions, this paper introduces specific use cases enhanced by nomadic networks. In addition, relevant Key Performance Indicators are discussed on the basis of the presented use cases. These serve as a starting point for the definition of requirement clusters and thus for a evaluation metric of nomadic non-public networks. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the potential of nomadic non-public networks in the dynamic landscape of 6G wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>

Abstract: The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be quantum-resistant.</description>

      <title>Large AI Model-Based Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) is an emerging intelligent paradigm, offering solutions for various future applications like metaverse, mixed reality, and the Internet of Everything. However, in current SC systems, the construction of the knowledge base (KB) faces several issues, including limited knowledge representation, frequent knowledge updates, and insecure knowledge sharing. Fortunately, the development of the large AI model (LAM) provides new solutions to overcome the above issues. Here, we propose a LAM-based SC framework (LAM-SC) specifically designed for image data, where we first apply the segment anything model (SAM)-based KB (SKB) that can split the original image into different semantic segments by universal semantic knowledge. Then, we present an attention-based semantic integration (ASI) to weigh the semantic segments generated by SKB without human participation and integrate them as the semantic aware image. Additionally, we propose an adaptive semantic compression (ASC) encoding to remove redundant information in semantic features, thereby reducing communication overhead. Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the LAM-SC framework and the possibility of applying the LAM-based KB in future SC paradigms.</description>

      <title>LAMBO: Large AI Model Empowered Edge Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Next-generation edge intelligence is anticipated to benefit various applications via offloading techniques. However, traditional offloading architectures face several issues, including heterogeneous constraints, partial perception, uncertain generalization, and lack of tractability. In this paper, we propose a Large AI Model-Based Offloading (LAMBO) framework with over one billion parameters for solving these problems. We first use input embedding (IE) to achieve normalized feature representation with heterogeneous constraints and task prompts. Then, we introduce a novel asymmetric encoder-decoder (AED) as the decision-making model, which is an improved transformer architecture consisting of a deep encoder and a shallow decoder for global perception and decision. Next, actor-critic learning (ACL) is used to pre-train the AED for different optimization tasks under corresponding prompts, enhancing the AED's generalization in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we propose an active learning from expert feedback (ALEF) method to fine-tune the decoder of the AED for tracking changes in dynamic environments. Our simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed LAMBO framework.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this single identity is not robust enough to protect the whole system and the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively authenticated. Therefore, a multi-factor authentication service is utilized to help guarantee the account security by transmitting a second factor to the user to use. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with all login credentials, and if the corresponding identifiers are not transmitted via the network and operated by users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To this end, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, which defines identities for the username and the login password, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can verify the identifiers at the username and password forms in succession. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or any third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, they are useless in online attacks.</description>
