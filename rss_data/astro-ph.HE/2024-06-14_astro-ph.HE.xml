      <title>Whispering in the dark: faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Observation of Declination Dependence in the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an observation of the difference between northern and southern skies of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray energy spectrum with a significance of ${\sim}8\sigma$. We use measurements from the two largest experiments$\unicode{x2014}$the Telescope Array observing the northern hemisphere and the Pierre Auger Observatory viewing the southern hemisphere. Since the comparison of two measurements from different observatories introduces the issue of possible systematic differences between detectors and analyses, we validate the methodology of the comparison by examining the region of the sky where the apertures of the two observatories overlap. Although the spectra differ in this region, we find that there is only a $1.8\sigma$ difference between the spectrum measurements when anisotropic regions are removed and a fiducial cut in the aperture is applied.</description>

      <title>Proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies in muon-depleted air showers with different depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardness of the energy spectrum of neutral pions produced in proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies, above $10^{18}$ eV, is constrained by the steepness of the shower-to-shower distribution of the number of muons in muon-depleted extensive air showers. In this work, we find that this steepness, quantified by the parameter $\Lambda_\mu$, evolves with the depth of the shower maximum, $X_{\max}$, assuming a universal value for shallow showers and an enhanced dependence on the high-energy hadronic interaction model for deep showers. We show that Xmax probes the so-called hadronic activity of the first interaction, thus allowing direct access to the energy spectrum of neutral pions in different regions of the kinematic phase space of the first interaction. We verify that the unbiased measurement of $\Lambda_\mu$ is possible for realistic mass composition expectations. Finally, we infer that the statistical precision in $\Lambda_\mu$ required to distinguish between hadronic interaction models can be achieved in current extensive air shower detectors, given their resolution and exposure.</description>

      <title>The neutron-star merger delay-time distribution, r-process "knees", and the metal budget of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sample of 18 recycled millisecond pulsars (rMSPs) that are in double neutron star (DNS) systems, and 42 rMSPs that are not in DNS pairs, we analyze the distributions of the characteristic age, $\tau_c$, and the time until merger of the double systems, $\tau_{\rm gw}$. Based on the $\tau_c$ distribution of non-DNS rMSPs, we argue that $\tau_c$ is a reasonable estimator of true pulsar age and that rMSPs are active as pulsars for a long (~Hubble) time. Among the DNSs there is an excess of young systems (small $\tau_c$) with short life expectancy (small $\tau_{\rm gw}$) compared to model expectations for the distributions of $\tau_c$ and $\tau_{\rm gw}$ if, at birth, DNSs have a delay-time distribution (DTD) of the form $t^{-1}$ (expected generically for close binaries), or for that matter, from expectations from any single power-law DTD. A two-population DNS model solves the problem: the data are best fit by the combination of a "fast" population with DTD going as $t^{-1.9\pm0.4}$, and a "slow" population of DNSs, with DTD proportional to $t^{-1.1\pm0.15}$. The fast population can be equivalently represented by a DTD with an exponential cutoff beyond t~300 Myr. The fast population completely dominates, by a factor A~10-100, the numbers of DNSs that merge within a Hubble time, and that presumably lead to short gamma-ray bursts and kilonova explosions. With a simple, empirically based, chemical-evolution calculation, we show that the fast/steep kilonova DTD, convolved with the measured star-formation history of the Milky Way's thick-disk population, naturally reproduces the "knee" structure seen in abundance-ratio diagrams of thick-disk stars, for europium and two other r-process elements. As a corollary we show, based again solely on empirical input, that the Milky Way is nearly a "closed box" that has retained at least ~70-90% of the metals produced over the Galaxy's lifetime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Ultra Heavy Dark Matter Properties from Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies with LHAASO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we try to search for signals generated by ultra-heavy dark matter at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) data. We look for possible gamma-ray by dark matter annihilation or decay from 16 dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the field of view of LHAASO. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are among the most promising targets for indirect detection of dark matter which have low fluxes of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray background while large amount of dark matter. By analyzing more than 700 days observational data at LHAASO, no significant dark matter signal from 1 TeV to 1 EeV is detected. Accordingly we derive the most stringent constraints on the ultra-heavy dark matter annihilation cross-section up to EeV. The constraints on the lifetime of dark matter in decay mode are also derived.</description>

      <title>Probing the polarized emission from SMC X-1: the brightest X-ray pulsar observed by IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of X-ray pulsars (XRPs) performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have made it possible to investigate the intricate details of these objects in a new way, thanks to the added value of X-ray polarimetry. Here we present the results of the IXPE observations of SMC X-1, a member of the small group of XRPs displaying super-orbital variability. SMC X-1 was observed by IXPE three separate times during the high state of its super-orbital period. The observed luminosity in the 2-8 keV energy band of $L=2\times10^{38}$ erg/s makes SMC X-1 the brightest XRP ever observed by IXPE. We detect significant polarization in all three observations, with values of the phase-averaged polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of $3.2\pm0.8$% and $97\deg\pm8\deg$ for Observation 1, $3.0\pm0.9$% and $90\deg\pm8\deg$ for Observation 2, and $5.5\pm1.1$% and $80\deg\pm6\deg$ for Observation 3, for the spectro-polarimetric analysis. The observed PD shows an increase over time with decreasing luminosity, while the PA decreases in decrements of 10\deg. The phase-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals significant detection of polarization in three out of seven phase bins, with the PD ranging between 2% and 10%, and a corresponding range in the PA from $\sim$70\deg\ to $\sim$100\deg. The pulse-phase resolved PD displays an apparent anti-correlation with the flux. Using the rotating vector model, we obtain constraints on the pulsar's geometrical properties for the individual observations. The position angle of the pulsar displays an evolution over time supporting the idea that we observe changes related to different super-orbital phases. Scattering in the wind of the precessing accretion disk may be responsible for the behavior of the polarimetric properties observed during the high-state of SMC X-1's super-orbital period.</description>

      <title>The nature of the accretion physics in quiescent black hole system LB-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LB-1 is a binary system that has drawn great attention since its discovery in 2019. The nature of the two components of LB-1 is not very clear, which however is suggested very possibly to be a B-type star plus a black hole (BH). In this paper, we first calculate the wind mass-loss rate of the B-type star. We then calculate the mass capture rate by the BH, with which as the initial mass accretion rate, we calculate the truncation radius of the accretion disk and the corresponding emergent spectra of the accretion flow (comprising an inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) + an outer truncated accretion disk) within the framework of the disk evaporation model. It is found that the predicted truncation radius of the accretion disk with appropriate model parameters is consistent with observations inferred from the observed broad H$_\alpha$ emission line. The predicted X-ray luminosity is definitely below the estimated upper limits with the sensitivity of Chandra X-ray Observatory of the X-ray luminosity $\sim 2\times 10^{31}$ erg/s. Finally, we argue that if the disk evaporation model indeed reflects the intrinsic physics of the accretion flow, the value of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is constrained to be $\alpha \gtrsim 0.05$ (with BH mass being $68M_{\rm \odot}$), or $\alpha \gtrsim 0.003$ (with BH mass being $21M_{\rm \odot}$) to match the observed upper limit of the X-ray luminosity of LB-1.</description>

      <title>Measuring glitch recoveries and braking indices with Bayesian model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a selection of 35 pulsars with large spin-up glitches ($\Delta{\nu}/\nu\geq10^{-6}$), which are monitored by the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we analyse 157 glitches and their recoveries. All parameters are measured consistently and we choose the best model to describe the post-glitch recovery based on Bayesian evidence. We present updated glitch epochs, sizes, changes of spin down rate, exponentially recovering components (amplitude and corresponding timescale) when present, as well as pulsars' second frequency derivatives and their glitch associated changes if detected. We discuss the different observed styles of post-glitch recovery as well as some particularly interesting sources. Several correlations are revealed between glitch parameters and pulsar spin parameters, including a very strong correlation between a pulsar's interglitch $|\ddot{\nu}|$ and $\dot{\nu}$, as well as between the glitch-induced spin-down rate change $\Delta\dot{\nu}_{\rm p}$ that does not relax exponentially and $\dot{\nu}$. We find that the ratio $\left|\Delta \dot{\nu}_{\mathrm{p}}/\ddot{\nu}\right|$ can be used as an estimate of glitch recurrence times, especially for those pulsars for which there are indications of a characteristic glitch size and interglitch waiting time. We calculate the interglitch braking index $n$ and find that pulsars with large glitches typically have $n$ greater than $3$, suggesting that internal torques dominate the rotational evolution between glitches. The external torque, e.g. from electromagnetic dipole radiation, could dominate the observed $\ddot{\nu}$ for the youngest pulsars ($\lesssim10^{4}\;\mathrm{yr}$), which may be expected to display $n\sim3$.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Extensive Follow-Up of SN 2024ggi, a nearby type IIP supernova in NGC 3621</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and early observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi in NGC 3621 at 6.64 +/- 0.3 Mpc. The SN was caught 5.8 (+1.9 -2.9) hours after its explosion by the ATLAS survey. Early-phase, high-cadence, and multi-band photometric follow-up was performed by the Kinder (Kilonova Finder) project, collecting over 1000 photometric data points within a week. The combined o- and r-band light curves show a rapid rise of 3.3 magnitudes in 13.7 hours, much faster than SN 2023ixf (another recent, nearby, and well-observed SN II). Between 13.8 and 18.8 hours after explosion SN 2024ggi became bluer, with u-g colour dropping from 0.53 to 0.15 mag. The rapid blueward evolution indicates a wind shock breakout (SBO) scenario. No hour-long brightening expected for the SBO from a bare stellar surface was detected during our observations. The classification spectrum, taken 17 hours after the SN explosion, shows flash features of high-ionization species such as Balmer lines, He I, C III, and N III. Detailed light curve modeling reveals critical insights into the properties of the circumstellar material (CSM). Our favoured model has an explosion energy of 2 x 10^51 erg, a mass-loss rate of 10^-3 solar_mass/yr (with an assumed 10 km/s wind), and a confined CSM radius of 6 x 10^14 cm. The corresponding CSM mass is 0.4 solar_mass. Comparisons with SN 2023ixf highlight that SN 2024ggi has a smaller CSM density, resulting in a faster rise and fainter UV flux. The extensive dataset and the involvement of citizen astronomers underscore that a collaborative network is essential for SBO searches, leading to more precise and comprehensive SN characterizations.</description>

      <title>Ringdown stability: greybody factors as stable gravitational-wave observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>What no one has seen before: gravitational waveforms from warp drive collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite originating in science fiction, warp drives have a concrete description in general relativity, with Alcubierre first proposing a spacetime metric that supported faster-than-light travel. Whilst there are numerous practical barriers to their implementation in real life, including a requirement for negative energy, computationally, one can simulate their evolution in time given an equation of state describing the matter. In this work, we study the signatures arising from a warp drive "containment failure", assuming a stiff equation of state for the fluid. We compute the emitted gravitational-wave signal and track the energy fluxes of the fluid. Apart from its rather speculative application to the search for extraterrestrial life in gravitational-wave detector data, this work is interesting as a study of the dynamical evolution and stability of spacetimes that violate the null energy condition. Our work highlights the importance of exploring strange new spacetimes, to (boldly) simulate what no one has seen before.</description>

      <title>Optimising an Array of Cherenkov Telescopes in Australia for the Detection of TeV Gamma-Ray Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As TeV gamma-ray astronomy progresses into the era of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), instantaneously following up on gamma-ray transients is becoming more important than ever. To this end, a worldwide network of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes has been proposed. Australia is ideally suited to provide coverage of part of the Southern Hemisphere sky inaccessible to H.E.S.S. in Namibia and the upcoming CTA-South in Chile. This study assesses the sources detectable by a small, transient-focused array in Australia based on CTA telescope designs. The TeV emission of extragalactic sources (including the majority of gamma-ray transients) can suffer significant absorption by the extragalactic background light. As such, we explored the improvements possible by implementing stereoscopic and topological triggers, as well as lowered image cleaning thresholds, to access lower energies. We modelled flaring gamma-ray sources based on past measurements from the satellite-based gamma-ray telescope Fermi-LAT. We estimate that an array of four Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) would detect $\sim$24 active galactic nucleus flares &gt;5$\sigma$ per year, up to a redshift of $z\approx1.5$. Two MSTs achieved $\sim$80-90% of the detections of four MSTs. The modelled Galactic transients were detectable within the observation time of one night, 11 of the 21 modelled gamma-ray bursts were detectable, as were $\sim$10% of unidentified transients. An array of MST-class telescopes would thus be a valuable complementary telescope array for transient TeV gamma-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ups and downs in the X-ray emission of the colliding wind binaries HD 168112 and HD 167971</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-period O-star binary system HD 168112 and the triple O-star system HD 167971 are well-known sources of non-thermal radio emission that arises from a colliding wind interaction. The wind-wind collisions in these systems should result in phase-dependent X-ray emissions. The presence of a population of relativistic electrons in the wind interaction zone could affect the properties of the X-ray emission and make it deviate from the behaviour expected for adiabatic shocks. We investigate the X-ray emission of these systems with the goals of quantifying the fraction of the X-ray flux arising from wind interactions and determining whether these emissions follow the predictions for adiabatic wind-wind collisions. Six X-ray observations were collected with XMM-Newton. Three observations were scheduled around the most recent periastron passage of HD 168112. Spectra and light curves were analysed and compared with simple predictions of model calculations for X-ray emission from colliding wind systems. The X-ray emission of HD 168112 varies as the inverse of the orbital separation, as expected for an adiabatic wind interaction zone. The relative contribution of intrinsic X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks varies between 38% at periastron to 81% at apastron. The wind-wind collision zone remains adiabatic even around periastron passage. The X-ray emission of HD 167971 displays variations on the orbital timescale of the inner eclipsing binary. The existing data of this system do not allow us to probe variations on the timescale of the outer orbit. Shock modification due to the action of relativistic electrons does not seem to be efficiently operating in the HD 168112 system. In the existing observations, a significant part of the emission of HD 167971 must arise in the inner eclipsing binary. The origin of this emission is as yet unclear.</description>

      <title>CMB bounds on primordial black holes with dark matter mini-halos: the role of radiative feedback</title>

Abstract: Observations of the cosmic microwave background constrain the abundance of primordial black holes, as these would accrete gas and inject energy into the cosmological medium. We have revisited these constraints, taking into account the local heating and ionisation of the gas around the black holes. While constraints for \textit{naked} black holes are not significantly affected, bounds including dark matter mini-halos are drastically relaxed. This result suggests that previous analysis may have significantly overestimated the role of dark matter mini-halos in boosting the accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Jet formation in post-AGB binaries: Confronting cold magnetohydrodynamic disc wind wind models with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We consider cold self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc wind solutions to describe jets launching from the circumcompanion accretion discs in post-AGB binaries. Resulting predictions are matched to observations for five different post-AGB binaries. This both tests the physical validity of the MHD disc wind paradigm and reveals the accretion disc properties.
  Results: Many of the time-series' properties are reproduced well by the models, though systematic mismatches, such as overestimated rotation, remain. Four targets imply accretion discs that reach close to the secondary's stellar surface, while one is fitted with an unrealistically large inner radius of about 20 stellar radii. Some fits imply inner disc temperatures over 10 000 K, seemingly discrepant with a previous observational estimate from H band interferometry. This estimate is, however, shown to be biased. Fitted mass-accretion rates range from about 10^-6 to 10^-3 solar masses per year. Relative to jets launched from young stellar objects (YSOs), all targets prefer winds with higher ejection efficiencies, lower magnetizations and thicker discs.
  Conclusions: Our models show that current cold MHD disc wind solutions can explain many of the jet-related Balmer alpha features seen in post-AGB binaries, though systematic discrepancies remain. This includes, but is not limited to, overestimated rotation and underestimated post-AGB circumbinary disc lifetimes. The consideration of thicker discs and the inclusion of irradiation from the post-AGB primary, leading to warm magnetothermal wind launching, might alleviate these.</description>

      <title>Surface and curvature tensions of relativistic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we show a simple method to obtain fittings for the surface and curvature tensions. The method uses the nuclear mass of a spherical fully ionized atom and a simple expression for the binding energy such that a least square fit is found when confronted with the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) 2020. The fittings are then used to evaluate the pasta phase free energy per particle, which is confronted with the one obtained with a Thomas-Fermi fitting. The results are very encouraging and suggest that this recipe can be safely used whenever the surface and curvature tensions are necessary.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray emission in the MeV-GeV range from explosive cosmic events is of invaluable relevance to understanding physical processes related to the formation of neutron stars and black holes. Here we report on the detection by the AGILE satellite in the MeV-GeV energy range of the remarkable long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. The AGILE onboard detectors have good exposure to GRB 221009A during its initial crucial phases. Hard X-ray/MeV emission in the prompt phase lasted hundreds of seconds, with the brightest radiation being emitted between 200 and 300 seconds after the initial trigger. Very intense GeV gamma-ray emission is detected by AGILE in the prompt and early afterglow phase up to 10,000 seconds. Time-resolved spectral analysis shows time-variable MeV-peaked emission simultaneous with intense power-law GeV radiation that persists in the afterglow phase. The coexistence during the prompt phase of very intense MeV emission together with highly nonthermal and hardening GeV radiation is a remarkable feature of GRB 221009A. During the prompt phase, the event shows spectrally different MeV and GeV emissions that are most likely generated by physical mechanisms occurring in different locations. AGILE observations provide crucial flux and spectral gamma-ray information regarding the early phases of GRB 221009A during which emission in the TeV range was reported.</description>

Abstract: We highlight the capacity of current and forthcoming air shower arrays using water-Cherenkov stations to detect neutrino events spanning energies from $10\,$GeV to $100\,$TeV. This detection approach leverages individual stations equipped with both bottom and top photosensors, making use of features of the signal time trace and machine learning techniques. Our findings demonstrate the complementary of this method to established and future neutrino-detection experiments, including IceCube and the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Highly-Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binaries in the Milli-hertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many gravitational wave (GW) sources are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity in the millihertz band. These highly eccentric compact object binaries may commonly serve as a progenitor stage of GW mergers, particularly in dynamical channels where environmental perturbations bring a binary with large initial orbital separation into a close pericenter passage, leading to efficient GW emission and a final merger. This work examines the stochastic GW background from highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$), stellar-mass sources in the mHz band. Our findings suggest that these binaries can contribute a substantial GW power spectrum, potentially exceeding the LISA instrumental noise at $\sim 3-7$~mHz. This stochastic background is likely to be dominated by eccentric sources within the Milky Way, thus introducing anisotropy and time dependence in LISA's detection. However, given efficient search strategies to identify GW transients from highly eccentric binaries, the unresolvable noise level can be substantially lower, approaching $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude below the LISA noise curve. Therefore, we highlight the importance of characterizing stellar-mass GW sources with extreme eccentricity, especially their transient GW signals in the millihertz band.</description>

      <title>The extreme coronal line emitter AT 2022fpx: Varying optical polarization properties and late-time X-ray flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes disrupt passing stars, producing outbursts called tidal disruption events (TDEs). TDEs have recently gained attention due to their unique dynamics and emission processes, which are still not fully understood. Especially, the so-called optical TDEs, are of interest as they often exhibit delayed or obscured X-ray emission from the accretion disk, making the origin of the prompt emission unclear. In this paper, we present multiband optical polarization observations and optical spectrometry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, alongside monitoring observations in optical, ultraviolet and X-rays. The optical spectra of AT 2022fpx show Bowen fluorescence as well as highly-ionized iron emission lines, which are characteristic of extreme coronal line emitters. Additionally, the source exhibits variable but low-polarized continuum emission at the outburst peak, with a clear rotation of the polarization angle. X-ray emission observed approximately 250 days after the outburst peak in the decay appear flare-like but is consistent with constant temperature black-body emission. The overall outburst decay is slower than for typical TDEs, and resembles more the ones seen from Bowen fluorescence flares. These observations suggest that AT 2022fpx could be a key source in linking different long-lived TDE scenarios. Its unique characteristics, such as extreme coronal line emission, variable polarization, and delayed X-ray flare, can be attributed to the outer shock scenario or a clumpy torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. Further studies, especially in the context of multi-wavelength observations, are crucial to fully understand the dynamics and emission mechanisms of these intriguing astrophysical events.</description>

      <title>A Fast-cadenced Search for Gamma-Ray Burst Orphan Afterglows with the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relativistic outflows that produce Long GRBs (LGRBs) can be described by a structured jet model where prompt $\gamma$-ray emission is restricted to a narrow region in the jet's core. Viewing the jet off-axis from the core, a population of afterglows without an associated GRB detection can be predicted. In this work, we conduct an archival search for these `orphan' afterglows (OAs) with minute-cadence, deep ($g\sim23$) data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) taken as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF). We introduce a method to select fast-evolving OA candidates within DWF data that comprises a machine learning model, based on a realistic synthetic population of OAs. Using this classifier, we recover 51 OA candidates. Of these candidates, 42 are likely flare events from M-class stars. The remaining nine possess quiescent, coincident sources in archival data with angular profiles consistent with a star and are inconsistent with the expected population of LGRB host galaxies. We therefore conclude that these are likely Galactic events. We calculate an upper limit on the rate of OAs down to $g&lt;22$ AB mag of 7.46\,deg$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$ using our criteria and constrain possible jet structures. We also place an upper limit of the characteristic angle between the $\gamma$-ray emitting region and the jet's half opening angle. For a smooth power-law and a power-law with core jet model respectively, these values are $58.3^{\circ}$ and $56.6^{\circ}$, for a power-law index of 0.8 and $75.3^{\circ}$ and $76.8^{\circ}$ for a power-law index of 1.2.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of electron-positron induced streaming instability in the context of gamma-ray halos around pulsars</title>

Abstract: The possibility of slow diffusion regions as the origin for extended TeV emission halos around some pulsars (such as PSR J0633+1746 and PSR B0656+14) challenges the standard scaling of the electron diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium. Self-generated turbulence by electron-positron pairs streaming out of the pulsar wind nebula was proposed as a possible mechanism to produce the enhanced turbulence required to explain the morphology and brightness of these TeV halos. We perform fully kinetic 1D3V particle-in-cell simulations of this instability, considering the case where streaming electrons and positrons have the same density. This implies purely resonant instability as the beam does not carry any current. We compare the linear phase of the instability with analytical theory and find very reasonable agreement. The non-linear phase of the instability is also studied, which reveals that the intensity of saturated waves is consistent with a momentum exchange criterion between a decelerating beam and growing magnetic waves. With the adopted parameters, the instability-driven wavemodes cover both the Alfv\'enic (fluid) and kinetic scales. The spectrum of the produced waves is non-symmetric, with left-handed circular polarisation waves being strongly damped when entering the ion-cyclotron branch, while right-handed waves are suppressed at smaller wavelength when entering the Whistler branch. The low-wavenumber part of the spectrum remains symmetric when in the Alfv\'enic branch. As a result, positrons behave dynamically differently compared to electrons. We also observed a second harmonic plasma emission in the wave spectrum. An MHD-PIC approach is warranted to probe hotter beams and investigate the Alfv\'en branch physics. This work confirms that the self-confinement scenario develops essentially according to analytical expectations [...](abridged)</description>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos since they provide environments rich in matter and photon targets where cosmic ray interactions may lead to the production of gamma rays and neutrinos. We searched for high-energy neutrino emission from AGN using the $\textit{Swift}$-BAT Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) catalog of hard X-ray sources and 12 years of IceCube muon track data. First, upon performing a stacked search, no significant emission was found. Second, we searched for neutrinos from a list of 43 candidate sources and found an excess from the direction of two sources, Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151. We observed NGC 1068 at flux $\phi_{\nu_{\mu}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}}$ = $4.02_{-1.52}^{+1.58} \times 10^{-11}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ normalized at 1 TeV, with power-law spectral index, $\gamma$ = 3.10$^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, consistent with previous IceCube results. The observation of a neutrino excess from the direction of NGC 4151 is at a post-trial significance of 2.9$\sigma$. If interpreted as an astrophysical signal, the excess observed from NGC 4151 corresponds to a flux $\phi_{\nu_{\mu}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}}$ = $1.51_{-0.81}^{+0.99} \times 10^{-11}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ normalized at 1 TeV and $\gamma$ = 2.83$^{+0.35}_{-0.28}$.</description>

      <title>Regurgitated Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. As a concrete realization, we consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>X-ray View of Little Red Dots: Do They Host Supermassive Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs) -- a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies -- is one of the most surprising results from JWST. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: does the near-infrared emission originate from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or intense star formation? In this work, we utilize ultra-deep Chandra observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, Abell~2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of $\lesssim(1.5-16)\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of $\approx87$~Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H$\alpha$ emission. For the LRDs exhibiting broad-line H$\alpha$ emission, there is a hint of a stacked signal ($\sim2.6\sigma$), corresponding to a SMBH mass of $\sim3.2\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$. Assuming unobscured, Eddington-limited accretion, this BH mass is at least 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from virial mass estimates using JWST spectra. Given galaxy-dominated stellar mass estimates, our results imply that LRDs do not host over-massive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. However, alternative stellar mass estimates may still support that LRDs host over-massive BHs. The significant discrepancy between the JWST and Chandra data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H$\alpha$ line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.</description>

      <title>Boil-off of red supergiants: mass loss and type II-P supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass loss mechanism of red supergiant stars is not well understood, even though it has crucial consequences for their stellar evolution and the appearance of supernovae that occur upon core-collapse. We argue that outgoing shock waves launched near the photosphere can support a dense chromosphere between the star's surface and the dust formation radius at several stellar radii. We derive analytic expressions for the time-averaged density profile of the chromosphere, and we use these to estimate mass loss rates due to winds launched by radiation pressure at the dust formation radius. These mass loss rates are similar to recent observations, possibly explaining the upward kink in mass loss rates of luminous red supergiants. Our models predict that low-mass red supergiants lose less mass than commonly assumed, while high-mass red supergiants lose more. The chromospheric mass of our models is $\sim$0.01 solar masses, most of which lies within a few stellar radii. This can help explain the early light curves and spectra of type-II P supernovae without requiring extreme pre-supernova mass loss. We discuss implications for stellar evolution, type II-P supernovae, SN 2023ixf, and Betelgeuse.</description>
