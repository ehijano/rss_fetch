      <title>Diffraction of the Hat and Spectre tilings and some of their relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffraction spectra of the Hat and Spectre monotile tilings, which are known to be pure point, are derived and computed explicitly. This is done via model set representatives of self-similar members in the topological conjugacy classes of the Hat and the Spectre tiling, which are the CAP and the CASPr tiling, respectively. This is followed by suitable reprojections of the model sets to represent the original Hat and Spectre tilings, which also allows to calculate their Fourier--Bohr coefficients explicitly. Since the windows of the underlying model sets have fractal boundaries, these coefficients need to be computed via an exact renormalisation cocycle in internal space.</description>

      <title>Minimal tetrahedra and an isoperimetric gap theorem in non-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate isoperimetric inequalities for Lipschitz 2-spheres in CAT(0) spaces, proving bounds on the volume of efficient null-homotopies. In one dimension lower, it is known that a quadratic inequality with a constant smaller than $c_2=1/(4\pi)$ -- the optimal constant for the Euclidean plane -- implies that the underlying space is Gromov hyperbolic, and a linear inequality holds. We establish the first analogous gap theorem in higher dimensions: if a proper CAT(0) space satisfies a Euclidean inequality for 2-spheres with a constant below the sharp threshold $c_3=1/(6\sqrt{\pi})$, then the space also admits an inequality with an exponent arbitrarily close to 1. As a corollary we obtain a similar result for Lipschitz surfaces of higher genus. Towards our main theorem we prove a (non-sharp) Euclidean isoperimetric inequality for null-homotopies of 2-spheres, apparently missing in the literature. A novelty in our approach is the introduction of minimal tetrahedra, which we demonstrate satisfy a linear inequality.</description>

      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimension I: Criterion for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of dynamically defined Cantor sets in arbitrary dimensions, introducing a criterion for $\mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha}$ stable intersections of such Cantor sets, under a mild bunching condition. This condition is naturally satisfied for perturbations of conformal Cantor sets and, in particular, always holds in dimension one. Our work extends the celebrated recurrent compact set criterion of Moreira and Yoccoz for stable intersection of Cantor sets in the real line to higher-dimensional spaces. Based on this criterion, we develop a method for constructing explicit examples of stably intersecting Cantor sets in any dimension. This construction operates in the most fragile and critical regimes, where the Hausdorff dimension of one of the Cantor sets is arbitrarily small and both Cantor sets are nearly homothetical. All results and examples are provided in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <title>The dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 states that if $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is quasiconformally equivalently to an uniform domain, then the Gehring-Hayman inequality holds in $D$: quasihyperbolic geodesics in $D$ minimizes the Euclidean length among all curves in $D$ with the same end points, up to a universal dimension-dependent multiplicative constant.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to thstrengthen the above result in the following three aspects: 1) obtain a dimension-free multiplicative constant in the Gehring-Hayman inequality; 2) relax the class of quasihyperbolic geodesics to more general quasigeodesics; 3) relax the quasiconformal equivalence to more general coarsely quasihyperbolic equivalence.
  As a byproduct of our general approach, we are able to prove that the above improved Gehring-Hayman inequality indeed holds in Banach spaces. This answers affirmatively an open problem raised by J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 and reformulated by J. V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} in 2005.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Stability via Morse Limit Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgroup stability is a strong notion of quasiconvexity that generalizes convex cocompactness in a variety of settings. In this paper, we characterize stability of a subgroup by properties of its limit set on the Morse boundary. Given $H&lt;G$, both finitely generated, $H$ is stable exactly when all the limit points of $H$ are conical, or equivalently when all the limit points of $H$ are horospherical, as long as the limit set of $H$ is a compact subset of the Morse boundary for $G$. We also demonstrate an application of these results in the settings of the mapping class group for a finite type surface, $\text{Mod}(S)$.</description>

      <title>The Gauss image problem for pseudo-cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gauss image problem for convex bodies asks for the existence of a convex body that "links" two given measures on the unit sphere in a certain way. We treat here a corresponding question for pseudo-cones, that is, for unbounded closed convex sets strictly contained in their recession cones.</description>

      <title>On the kissing number of the cross-polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new upper bound $\kappa_T(K_n)\leq 2.9162^{(1+o(1))n}$ for the translative kissing number of the $n$-dimensional cross-polytope $K_n$ is proved, improving on Hadwiger's bound $\kappa_T(K_n)\leq 3^n-1$ from 1957. Furthermore, it is shown that there exist kissing configurations satisfying $\kappa_T(K_n)\geq 1.1637^{(1-o(1))n}$, which improves on the previous best lower bound $ \kappa_T(K_n)\geq 1.1348^{(1-o(1))n}$ by Talata. It is also shown that the lattice kissing number satisfies $\kappa_L(K_n)&lt; 12(2^n-1)$ for all $n\geq 1$, and that the lattice $D_4^+$ is the unique lattice, up to signed permutations of coordinates, attaining the maximum lattice kissing number $\kappa_L(K_4)=40$ in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Connectedness of the Gromov boundary of fine curve graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fine curve graph was introduced to study homeomorphism group of surfaces. In this paper we study the topology of the Gromov boundary of this graph for closed surfaces with higher genus. We first prove a bounded geodesic image theorem for the fine curve graph, a consequence of which is the non-compactness of the Gromov boundary. Using this theorem, we are able to show that the Gromov boundary is linearly connected with respect to some visual metric.</description>

      <title>On a Santal\'o point for Nakamura-Tsuji's Laplace transform inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nakamura and Tsuji recently obtained an integral inequality involving a Laplace transform of even functions that implies, at the limit, the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality in its functional form. Inspired by their method, based on the Fokker-Planck semi-group, we extend the inequality to non-even functions. We consider a well-chosen centering procedure by studying the infimum over translations in a double Laplace transform. This requires a new look on the existing methods and leads to several observations of independent interest on the geometry of the Laplace transform. Application to reverse hypercontractivity is also given.</description>
