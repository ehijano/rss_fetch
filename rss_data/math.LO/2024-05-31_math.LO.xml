      <title>Approximation Theory and Elementary Submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \emph{Approximation Theory} uses nicely-behaved subcategories to understand entire categories, just as projective modules are used to approximate arbitrary modules in classical homological algebra. We use set-theoretic \emph{elementary submodel arguments} to give new, short proofs of well-known theorems in approximation theory, sometimes with stronger results.</description>

      <title>Inner ultrahomogeneous groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study the class of inner ultrahomogeneous groups, which includes Hall's universal group and the universal locally recursively presentable group. We provide simple criteria for ample generic automorphisms, straight maximality, uniform simplicity and divisibility (all of which apply to both Hall's universal group and the universal locally recursively presentable group). We show that such groups of infinite exponent are not $\aleph_0$-saturated, their theories are not small, not rosy and have TP$_2$+SOP+IP$_n$ for all $n$. This strengthens and generalises known results about ample generic automorphisms and unstability of Hall's universal group. We also show that the exponents of finite exponent inner ultrahomogeneous groups are uniformly bounded, and we provide a series of examples of inner ultrahomogeneous groups.</description>

      <title>n-dependent continuous theories and hyperdefinable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the continuous modeling property for first-order structures and show that a first-order structure has the continuous modelling property if and only if its age has the embedding Ramsey property. We use generalized indiscernible sequences in continuous logic to study and characterize $n$-dependence for continuous theories and first-order hyperdefinable sets in terms of the collapse of indiscernible sequences.</description>

      <title>On limit models and parametrized noetherian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study limit models in the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings as algebraic objects. We characterize parametrized noetherian rings using the degree of injectivity of certain limit models.
  We show that the number of limit models and how close a ring is from being noetherian are inversely proportional.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $n \geq 0$ The following are equivalent.
  1. $R$ is left $(&lt;\aleph_{n } )$-noetherian but not left $(&lt; \aleph_{n -1 })$-noetherian.
  2.The abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $n +1$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every $\lambda \geq (\operatorname{card}(R) + \aleph_0)^+$ such that the class is stable in $\lambda$.
  We further show that there are rings such that the abstract elementary class of modules with embeddings has exactly $\kappa$ non-isomorphic $\lambda$-limit models for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Strong negation in the theory of computable functionals TCF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05491v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We incorporate strong negation in the theory of computable functionals TCF, a common extension of Plotkin's PCF and G\"{o}del's system $\mathbf{T}$, by defining simultaneously strong negation $A^{\mathbf{N}}$ of a formula $A$ and strong negation $P^{\mathbf{N}}$ of a predicate $P$ in TCF. As a special case of the latter, we get strong negation of an inductive and a coinductive predicate of TCF. We prove appropriate versions of the Ex falso quodlibet and of double negation elimination for strong negation in TCF. We introduce the so-called tight formulas of TCF i.e., formulas implied from the weak negation of their strong negation, and the relative tight formulas. We present various case-studies and examples, which reveal the naturality of our definition of strong negation in TCF and justify the use of TCF as a formal system for a large part of Bishop-style constructive mathematics.</description>

      <title>Hilbert polynomials for finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a tuple $\Phi = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_m)$ of commuting maps on a finitary matroid $X$. We show that if $\Phi$ satisfies certain conditions, then for any finite set $A\subseteq X$, the rank of $\{\phi_1^{r_1}\cdots\phi_m^{r_m}(a):a \in A\text{ and }r_1+\cdots+r_m = t\}$ is eventually a polynomial in $t$ (we also give a multivariate version of the polynomial). This allows us easily recover Khovanskii's theorem on the growth of sumsets, the existence of the classical Hilbert polynomial, and the existence of the Kolchin polynomial. We also prove some new Kolchin polynomial results for differential exponential fields and derivations on o-minimal fields, as well as a new result on the growth of Betti numbers in simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Computational Dualism and Objective Superintelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of intelligent software is flawed. The behaviour of software is determined by the hardware that "interprets" it. This undermines claims regarding the behaviour of theorised, software superintelligence. Here we characterise this problem as "computational dualism", where instead of mental and physical substance, we have software and hardware. We argue that to make objective claims regarding performance we must avoid computational dualism. We propose a pancomputational alternative wherein every aspect of the environment is a relation between irreducible states. We formalise systems as behaviour (inputs and outputs), and cognition as embodied, embedded, extended and enactive. The result is cognition formalised as a part of the environment, rather than as a disembodied policy interacting with the environment through an interpreter. This allows us to make objective claims regarding intelligence, which we argue is the ability to "generalise", identify causes and adapt. We then establish objective upper bounds for intelligent behaviour. This suggests AGI will be safer, but more limited, than theorised.</description>

      <title>Relative injective modules, superstability and noetherian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classes of modules closed under direct sums, $\mathcal{M}$-submodules and $\mathcal{M}$-epimorphic images where $\mathcal{M}$ is either the class of embeddings, $RD$-embeddings or pure embeddings.
  We show that the $\mathcal{M}$-injective modules of theses classes satisfy a Baer-like criterion. In particular, injective modules, $RD$-injective modules, pure injective modules, flat cotorsion modules and $\mathfrak{s}$-torsion pure injective modules satisfy this criterion. The argument presented is a model theoretic one. We use in an essential way stable independence relations which generalize Shelah's non-forking to abstract elementary classes.
  We show that the classical model theoretic notion of superstability is equivalent to the algebraic notion of a noetherian category for these classes. We use this equivalence to characterize noetherian rings, pure semisimple rings, perfect rings and finite products of finite rings and artinian valuation rings via superstability.</description>

      <title>Intuitionistic Quantum Logic Perspective: Static and Dynamic Revision Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical belief revision framework, as proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson, involves the revision of a theory based on eight postulates. In this paper, we focus on the exploration of a revision theory grounded in quantum mechanics, referred to as the natural revision theory.
  There are two reasoning modes in quantum systems: static intuitionistic reasoning, which incorporates contextuality, and dynamic reasoning, which is achieved through projection measurement. We combine the advantages of two intuitionistic quantum logic frameworks, as proposed by D{\"o}ring and Coecke, respectively. Our goal is to establish a truth-value assignment for intuitionistic quantum logic that not only aligns with the inherent characteristics of quantum mechanics but also supports truth-value reasoning. The natural revision theory is then investigated based on this approach.
  We introduce two types of revision operators that correspond to the two reasoning modes in quantum systems: static and dynamic revision. Furthermore, we highlight the distinctions between these two operators. Shifting away from classical revision paradigms, we consider the revision of consequence relations in intuitionistic quantum logic. We demonstrate how, within the natural revision theory framework, both revision operators collectively influence the consequence relations. Notably, the outcomes of revision process are impacted by the sequence in which these interweaved operators are deployed.</description>
