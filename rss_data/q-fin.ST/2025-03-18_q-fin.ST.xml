      <title>Financial sentiment analysis using FinBERT with application in predicting stock movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply sentiment analysis in financial context using FinBERT, and build a deep neural network model based on LSTM to predict the movement of financial market movement. We apply this model on stock news dataset, and compare its effectiveness to BERT, LSTM and classical ARIMA model. We find that sentiment is an effective factor in predicting market movement. We also propose several method to improve the model.</description>

      <title>Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</description>

      <title>Model-free Analysis of Dynamic Trading Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model-free approach for analyzing the risk and return for a broad class of dynamic trading strategies, including pairs trading, mean-reversion trading and other statistical arbitrage strategies, in terms of excursions of a trading signal away from a reference level. Our results are derived in a pathwise setting, without any probabilistic assumptions.
  We introduce the notion of {\delta}-excursion, defined as a path which deviates by {\delta} from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that every continuous path has a unique decomposition into {\delta}-excursions. This decomposition is useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to simple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss, and drawdown. We show that the high-frequency limit of mean-reversion strategies may be described in terms of the (p-th order) local time of the signal. In particular, our results yield a financial interpretation of the local time of an irregular path. Finally, we describe a non-parametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion properties match those observed in empirical data.</description>
