      <title>On the Accuracy of Compressibility Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study highlights the importance of satisfying the eddy viscosity equivalence below the logarithmic layer, to deriving accurate compressibility transformations. First, we analyze the ability of known transformations to satisfy the eddy viscosity equivalence and show that the accuracy of these transformation is strongly dependent on this ability. Secondly, in a step-by-step manner, we devise new transformations that satisfy this hypothesis. An approach based on curve fitting of the incompressible Direct Numerical Simulation data for eddy viscosity profiles below the logarithmic layer provides an extremely accurate transformation. That motivates self-contained methods, making use of mixing length formulas, in the inner region.
  It is shown that the accuracy of existing transformations can be significantly improved by applying these ideas, below the logarithmic layer. Motivated by the effectiveness of the formulations derived from eddy viscosity equivalence, we introduce a new integral transformation based on Reynolds number equivalence between compressible and incompressible flow. This approach is based on defining a new compressible velocity scale, which affects the accuracy of transformations. Several choices for the velocity scale are tested, and in each attempt, it is shown that the eddy viscosity equivalence plays a very important role for the accuracy of compressibility transformations.</description>

      <title>Tailoring formations of self-organizing hydrofoil schools towards high-efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new unconstrained simulations and constrained experiments of a pair of pitching hydrofoils in a leader-follower in-line arrangement. Free-swimming simulations of foils with $matched$ pitching amplitudes show self-organization into stable formations at a constant gap distance without any control. Leading-edge separation on the follower foil plays a crucial role in creating these formations by acting as an additional dynamic drag source on the follower, which depends on the gap spacing and phase synchronization. Over a wide range of phase synchronization, amplitude, and Lighthill number typical of biology, we discover that the stable gap distance scales with the actual wake wavelength of an isolated foil $rather$ $than$ the nominal wake wavelength. A scaling law for the actual wake wavelength is derived and shown to collapse data across a wide Reynolds number range of $200 \leq Re &lt; \infty$. Additionally, in both simulations and experiments $mismatched$ foil amplitudes are discovered to increase the efficiency of hydrofoil schools by 70% while maintaining a stable formation without closed-loop control. This occurs by (1) increasing the stable gap distance between foils such that they are pushed into a high-efficiency zone and (2) raising the level of efficiency in these zones. This study bridges the gap between constrained and unconstrained studies of in-line schooling by showing that constrained-foil measurements can be used as a map of the potential efficiency benefits of schooling. These findings can aid in the design of high-efficiency bio-robot schools and may provide insights into the energetics and behaviour of fish schools.</description>

      <title>Instability in centrifugally stable shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear instability of flows that are stable according to Rayleigh's criterion for rotating fluids. Using Taylor-Couette flow as a primary test case, we develop large Reynolds number matched asymptotic expansion theories. Our theoretical results not only aid in detecting instabilities previously reported by Deguchi (2017) across a wide parameter range but also clarify the physical mechanisms behind this counterintuitive phenomenon. Instability arises from the interaction between large-scale inviscid vortices and the viscous flow structure near the wall, which is analogous to Tollmien-Schlichting waves. Furthermore, our asymptotic theories and numerical computations reveal that similar instability mechanisms occur in boundary layer flows over convex walls.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned flow estimation with sparse data -- exemplified for the rooftop of a UAV vertiport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed data-driven framework for urban wind estimation. This framework validates and incorporates the Reynolds number independence for turbulent flows, thus allowing the extrapolation for wind conditions far beyond the training data. Another key enabler is a machine-learned non-dimensionalized manifold from snapshot data. The velocity field is modeled using a double encoder-decoder approach. The first encoder normalizes data using the oncoming wind speed, while the second encoder projects this normalized data onto the isometric feature mapping manifold. The decoders reverse this process, with $k$-nearest neighbor performing the first decoding and the second undoing the normalization. The manifold is coarse-grained by clustering to reduce the computational load for de- and encoding. The sensor-based flow estimation is based on the estimate of the oncoming wind speed and a mapping from sensor signal to the manifold latent variables. The proposed machine-learned flow estimation framework is exemplified for the flow above an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) vertiport. The wind estimation is shown to generalize well for rare wind conditions, not included in the original database.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations of Fluid Motion for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations} (RiNSE). We solve the RiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$, and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Taylor's swimming sheet near a soft boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1951, G.I. Taylor modeled swimming microorganisms by hypothesizing an infinite sheet in 2D moving in a viscous medium due to a wave passing through it. This simple model not only captured the ability of microorganisms to swim due to the wavy motion of a flagella, but further development into the model captured the optimal nature of metachronal waves observed in ciliates. While the additional effects of nearby rigid boundaries and complex environments have been addressed, herein we explore the correction induced by a nearby soft boundary. Our simple model allows us to show that the magnitude of the swimming velocity gets modified near soft boundaries, and reduces for transverse waves while it increases for longitudinal waves. We further delve into the energetics of the process and the deformation of the corresponding soft boundary, highlighting the synchronization of the oscillations induced on the soft boundary with the waves passing through the sheet and the corresponding changes to the power exerted on the fluid.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between Geometric Frequency and Lagrange Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper shows the equivalence between the geometric frequency of an electric quantity, namely, voltage and current, and the Lagrange derivative of a stream-line of a fluid. The geometric frequency is a concept recently proposed by the author and is a generalization of the instantaneous frequency, a quantity that is particularly important for the analysis and the control of electric power systems. On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.</description>

      <title>The helicity distribution for the incompressible Euler equations on bounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the helicity associated to solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. We show that under mild conditions on the regularity of the velocity field of an incompressible ideal fluid it is possible to define a defect distribution describing the local helicity balance. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we also provide the global helicity balance on bounded domains in terms of the boundary contributions of the vorticity, velocity and pressure.</description>

      <title>Side-heated Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.04042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike solids, the heat transfer in fluids can be greatly enhanced due to the presence of convection. Under gravity, an unevenly distributed temperature field results in differences in buoyancy, driving fluid motion that is seen in Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC). In RBC, the overall heat flux is found to have a power-law dependence on the imposed temperature difference, with enhanced heat transfer much beyond thermal conduction. In a bounded domain of fluid such as a cube, how RBC responds to thermal perturbations from the vertical sidewall is not clear. Will sidewall heating or cooling modify flow circulation and heat transfer? We address these questions experimentally by adding heat to one side of the RBC. Through careful flow, temperature, and heat flux measurements, the effects of adding side heating to RBC are examined and analyzed, where a further enhancement of flow circulation and heat transfer is observed. Our results also point to a direct and simple control of the classical RBC system, allowing further manipulation and control of thermal convection through sidewall conditions.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Model for Predicting the Drag Coefficient of Arbitrary Bluff Shaped Bodies at High Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an accurate model for the drag coefficient of arbitrary bluff bodies that is valid for high Reynolds numbers ($Re$). The model is based on the drag coefficient model derived for the case of a sphere:, $C_D = a_1 +{\frac{K a_2}{Re}} +{a_3\log(Re)+ a_4\log^2(Re) + a_5\log^4(Re)}$ (El Hasadi and Padding, Chemical Engineering Science, Vol. 265, 2023). The coefficients $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$, and $a_5$ do not depend on the object's shape or its orientation with respect to the flow, and $K$ is the Stokes drag correction factor, which for the case of the sphere, is equal to 1.0. The shape and orientation effects are included in the value of $a_1$ for the high Reynolds number flow regime. Interestingly, we found a strong correlation between the value of the $a_1$ coefficient and the frictional drag derived from boundary layer theory. One of the main findings of this investigation is that the rate of change of the drag coefficient with respect to the Reynolds number in the inertial flow regime is independent of the shape of the body or its orientation. Our model successfully predicts, with acceptable accuracy, the historical data of Wieselsberger (Technical Report, 1922) for the case of an infinite cylinder. Additionally, the model predicts the drag coefficient of other bluff body geometries such as oblate and prolate spheroids, spherocylinders, cubes, normal flat plates and irregular non-spherical particles\@. Additionally, we present a power-based model for the drag coefficient: \( C_D = a_{p_1} + \frac{24K}{Re} + \frac{4.119}{\sqrt{Re}} \). In this model, the term \( a_{p_1} \) represents the asymptotic form drag in the subcritical flow regime for different bluff body geometries\@.</description>

      <title>Wake structures and performance of wind turbine rotor with harmonic surging motions under laminar and turbulent inflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of a full-scale horizontal-axis Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) subjected to harmonic surging motions under both laminar and turbulent inflow conditions. Utilizing high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, namely Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) with Actuator Line Model (ALM), this research investigates the rotor performance, wake characteristics, and wake structures of a surging FOWT in detail. The study delves into the influence of varying inflow turbulence intensities, surging settings, and their interplay on the aerodynamic performance and the wake aerodynamics of a FOWT rotor. The results show that, through employing the phase-locking technique, Surging Induced Periodic Coherent Structures (SIPCS) can be identified in the wake of all the surging cases studied, irrespective of the inflow conditions and the surging settings. Additionally, the findings show that the faster wake recovery observed in the surging-laminar cases is not caused by facilitating instability-induced faster wake breakdown, a previously accepted hypothesis. Instead, it is the enhanced advection process resulting from the induction fields of SIPCS that causes the wake to recover faster. The analysis of rotor performance shows that the time-averaged rotor performances are affected by the intricate dynamics arising from the surging motions. With certain surging settings, the time-averaged thrust and the time-averaged power of a surging rotor are found to be simultaneously lower and higher compared to those of a fixed rotor. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of considering both the magnitude of surging and the rate of surging ($\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$) simultaneously to fully characterize the hysteresis load on a surging rotor.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth's tropics are characterized by quasi-steady precipitation with small oscillations about a mean value, which has led to the hypothesis that moist convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium (QE). In contrast, very warm simulations of Earth's tropical convection are characterized by relaxation-oscillator-like (RO) precipitation, with short-lived convective storms and torrential rainfall forming and dissipating at regular intervals with little to no precipitation in between. We develop a model of moist convection by combining a zero-buoyancy model of bulk-plume convection with a QE heat engine model, and we use it to show that QE is violated at high surface temperatures. We hypothesize that the RO state emerges when the equilibrium condition of the convective heat engine is violated, i.e., when the heating rate times a thermodynamic efficiency exceeds the rate at which work can be performed. We test our hypothesis against one- and three-dimensional numerical simulations and find that it accurately predicts the onset of RO convection. The proposed mechanism for RO emergence from QE breakdown is agnostic of the condensable, and can be applied to any planetary atmosphere undergoing moist convection. To date, RO states have only been demonstrated in three-dimensional convection-resolving simulations, which has made it seem that the physics of the RO state requires simulations that can explicitly resolve the three-dimensional interaction of cloudy plumes and their environment. We demonstrate that RO states also exist in single-column simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with parameterized convection, albeit in a different surface temperature range and with much longer storm-free intervals.</description>
