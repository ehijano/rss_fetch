      <title>How do higher-order interactions shape the energy landscape?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how higher-order interactions shape the energy landscape of coupled oscillator networks is crucial for characterizing complex synchronization phenomena. Here, we investigate a generalized Kuramoto model with triadic interactions, combining deterministic basin analysis, noise-induced transitions, and quantum annealing methods. We uncover a dual effect of higher-order interactions: they simultaneously expand basins for non-twisted states while contracting those of twisted states, yet modify potential well depths for both. As triadic coupling strengthens, higher-winding-number states and non-twisted states gain stability relative to synchronized states. The system exhibits remarkable stability asymmetry, where states with small basins can possess deep potential wells, making them highly resistant to noise-induced transitions once formed. These findings extend quasipotential theory to high-dimensional networked systems and offer new insights for controlling synchronization in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Resilience and adaptability in self-evidencing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will articulate a view of resilience under the free energy principle and vice versa. The free energy principle is about existence and identity, and resilience is the condition under which things exist at all. In previous work this has been investigated as modelling resilience using the free energy principle. We will extend that work by making the case that self-organisation under the free energy principle is about resilience, in the sense that identity is a constant process of self-reconfiguration, implying the existence of a self-model and the energy to reconfigure that self-model -- and hence, the resilience of a maintained identity under changes. A general framework for thinking about resilience in this context will be sketched out and some models will be provided using that framework.</description>

      <title>Slow and Fast Neurons Cooperate in Contextual Working Memory through Timescale Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural systems process information across a broad range of intrinsic timescales, both within and across cortical areas. While such diversity is a hallmark of biological networks, its computational role in nonlinear information processing remains elusive. In this study, we examine how heterogeneity in intrinsic neural timescales within the frontal cortex - a region central to cognitive control - enhances performance in a context-dependent working memory task. We develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) composed of units with distinct time constants to model a delayed match-to-sample task with contextual cues. This task demands nonlinear integration of temporally dispersed inputs and flexible behavioral adaptation. Our analysis shows that task performance is optimized when fast and slow timescales are appropriately balanced. Intriguingly, slow neurons, despite weaker encoding of task-relevant inputs, play a causal role in sustaining memory and improving performance. In contrast, fast neurons exhibit strong but transient encoding of input signals. These results highlight a division of computational roles among neurons with different timescales: slow dynamics support stable internal states, while fast dynamics enable rapid signal encoding. Our findings provide a mechanistic account of how temporal heterogeneity contributes to nonlinear information processing in neural circuits, shedding light on the dynamic architecture underlying cognitive flexibility.</description>
