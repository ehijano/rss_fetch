      <title>Graphene Growth on Copper Substrate by LAMMPS Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We learned the atomic deposition simulation of LAMMPS independently, referenced and optimized the modeling ideas of several papers, used the (1 1 1) crystalline surface of Cu atoms as a substrate, deposited C atoms produced by methane cleavage to obtain graphene flakes, and analyzed the deposition rate and deposition quality at three temperatures, obtaining conclusions consistent with the process flow. We found that there were obvious problems in previous papers. After a certain period, the overall system pressure became excessively high, causing simulation crashes and preventing analysis of subsequent results. In addition, understanding of potential function selection was incomplete. Therefore, after correcting these issues, a simulation system with relatively stable pressure was constructed. In addition to the result analysis, a potential-function selection table is provided, with some parameters taken from prior experimental calculations and others obtained via DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>From orbital analysis to active learning: an integrated strategy for the accelerated design of TADF emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters must satisfy two competing requirements: small singlet-triplet energy gaps for thermal upconversion and sufficient spin-orbit coupling for fast reverse intersystem crossing. Predicting these properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96 for $\Delta E_{ST}$. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sampling. Three application domains are explored: NIR-emitting probes for bioimaging, photocatalytic sensitizers, and fast-response materials for photodetection.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Phase Transition of DPPH Induced by a Magic Angle Helical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7{\deg}$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\mu}{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Magnetoresistances in Chiral Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurement of thermal conductivity and specific heat in quasi-2D membranes by 3{\omega} thermal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toward measuring the thermal properties of exfoliated atomically thin materials, we demonstrate simultaneous measurements of the thermal conductivity and specific heat in suspended membranes. We use the 3{\omega} technique applied to quasi-two-dimensional silicon nitride membranes having a metal line heater patterned on the surface to both deliver heat and directly measure the thermal impedance of the membrane at the heating frequency, Z(2{\omega}). We derive an expression for the complex thermal impedance as a function of frequency, approximating the actual rectangular membranes with a one dimensional model. The derivation accounts for potential parasitic heat loss mechanisms including conduction along the heater line, and by the gas load in an imperfect vacuum. Qualitatively, the thermal impedance response resembles a low-pass filter, owing to the combination of the total thermal resistance and total specific heat. Fitting Z(2{\omega}) to measurements across a few decades in frequency, we extract values of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of silicon nitride in agreement with literature values. We also study the dependence on the heating current, and compare to measurements of the thermal conductivity at zero frequency.</description>

      <title>From Mono- to Hexa-Interstitials: Computational Insights into Carbon Defects in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of carbon self-interstitial defects in diamond, ranging from mono- to hexa-interstitial complexes. By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification.</description>

      <title>Polarons from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.</description>

      <title>Scale-robust Low Resistance Transport in Atomic Layer Deposited Topological Semimetal Wafers on Amorphous Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data-centric computing advances, energy-efficient interconnects are increasingly critical for AI-driven systems. Traditional metal conductors face severe limitations at nanoscale due to increased resistivity from surface scattering. In response, this study demonstrates the first wafer-scale realization of an amorphous topological semimetal, tantalum phosphide (TaP), grown directly on amorphous SiO2 substrates (without any seed layers) using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulting TaP films exhibit unconventional resistivity scaling: decreasing resistivity with decreasing thickness, reaching 227 micro-ohm cm at ~2.3 nm film thickness. This behavior, observed without crystalline order or seed layers, indicates dominant surface conduction and establishes ALD-TaP as a promising candidate for back-end-of-line integration. The films also show excellent conformality, stoichiometry control, and thermal stability up to 600 degree C. A two-channel conduction model confirms surface-dominated transport in ultrathin regimes, further supported by enhanced conductivity in multi-stacked configurations. These findings highlight the potential of amorphous topological semimetals for future high-density, low-power electronic interconnects and expand the applicability of ALD for integrating novel quantum materials at scale.</description>

      <title>Radiation resistance of refractory high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are studied: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.</description>

      <title>Rewritable Complementary Nanoelectronics Enabled by Electron-Beam Programmable Ambipolar Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to reversibly and site-selectively tune ambipolar doping in a single semiconductor is crucial for reconfigurable electronics beyond silicon, but remains highly challenging. Here, we present a rewritable architecture based on electron-beam programmable field-effect transistors (FETs). Using WSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate electron-beam-induced doping that enables reversible, precisely controlled carrier modulation exceeding $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The in-situ writing, erasing, and rewriting of ambipolar doping of nanoscale patterns was directly visualized by scanning microwave impedance microscopy. This mask-free, lithography-compatible approach can achieve precise band engineering within individual channels, yielding near-ideal subthreshold swings (~ 60 mV/dec) and finely tunable threshold voltages for both carrier types without specialized contact engineering. These capabilities allow on-demand realization of high performance logic, including CMOS inverters with high voltage gains and low power consumption, as well as NAND-to-NOR transitions on the same device via direct polarity rewriting. Our platform offers a scalable and versatile route for rapid prototyping of complementary electronics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the buried interphase between solid electrolytes and lithium metal using neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.</description>

      <title>Stacking-sliding and irradiation-direction invariant Floquet altermagnets in A-type antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arranging the stacking orders of A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) bilayers offers an accessible pathway to two-dimensional altermagnets, but requires strict symmetry conditions such as layer groups, sliding positions, and twisting angles. Here, we find that circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling the development of altermagnets beyond these constraints. Based on symmetrical analysis, our revealments indicate that A-AFM bilayer building-blocks with inversion symmetry exhibit altermagnetism robust to stacking sliding and variations of illumination directions. These bilayers can be constructed from arbitrary ferromagnetic monolayers and guided by the $d$-electron counting rule. Adopting bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a template, out-of-plane illumination with CPL reveals an $f$-wave altermagnetic feature at sliding positions $\left\{E|\left(0,0\right)\right\}$, $\left\{E|\left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}\right)\right\}$ and $\left\{E|\left(\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)\right\}$, while a $p$-wave feature is predicted at other sliding positions. Our unveilings popularize the applicability of altermagnets in A-AFM bilayers with inversion symmetry, igniting a new wave of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Ferromagnetic and Antiferromagnetic Interactions in Epitaxial Co$_3$PdN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides with the general formula M$_3$N have attracted significant attention due to their tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 ${\mu}_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $\Theta$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($\Theta$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.</description>

Abstract: The epitaxial growth of group 13-nitride semiconductors (GaN, AlN, and AlGaN alloys) for the mass production and fabrication of high-frequency and high-power devices relies on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using metal-organic molecules, also called precursors. While this growth method ensures high productivity and low operation costs compared to other methods, its most significant disadvantage lies in the presence of carbon atoms in the precursors, which are unavoidably incorporated into the epitaxial layers and hamper the performance of most types of fabricated devices. Carbon-free precursors for the CVD process could enhance the performance of high-frequency and high-power nitride-based devices while maintaining growth capability in industrial equipment. In this work, we implement gallium- and aluminum-brominated precursors, which contain no carbon atoms, to grow GaN and AlN layers in an industrial CVD system. We compare the results of this alternative CVD process with the conventional method using trimethyl precursors through several characterization techniques, indicating a clear reduction in optically active carbon-related defects.</description>

      <title>Doping induced magnetism and half-metallicity in nanoribbons of quartic dispersion materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quartic dispersion materials are known to develop magnetization upon doping. Here we conduct a systematic investigation of magnetization in hole-doped quartic dispersion materials (GaS, InSe, TiO$_{2}$), focusing on the effects of structural confinement from 2D monolayers to quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons (NRs). Upon hole doping, these NRs develop itinerant magnetization across a broad range of carrier densities and display half-metallic behavior. The spin-polarization energies ($E_{sp}$) of these NRs enhance remarkably relative to their 2D counterparts, with maximum increase being in the case of TiO$_{2}$ from 31 to 103 meV/carrier. The $E_{sp}$ strongly depends on the degree of localization of the magnetic moments along the width of NRs, which is determined by edge passivation and ribbon width. Strong deformation of the topmost valence bands at higher dopings indicates deviation from the Stoner mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding thin films, a class of low-dimensional materials capable of maintaining structural integrity without substrates, have emerged as a forefront research focus. Their unique advantages-circumventing substrate clamping, liberating intrinsic material properties, and enabling cross-platform heterogeneous integration-underpin this prominence. This review systematically summarizes core fabrication techniques, including physical delamination (e.g., laser lift-off, mechanical exfoliation) and chemical etching, alongside associated transfer strategies. It further explores the induced strain modulation mechanisms, extreme mechanical properties and interface decoupling effects enabled by these films. Representative case studies demonstrate breakthrough applications in flexible/ultrathin electronics, ultrahigh-sensitivity sensors and the exploration of novel quantum states. Critical challenges regarding scalable fabrication, precise interface control, and long-term stability are analyzed, concluding with prospects for emerging applications in bio-inspired intelligent devices, quantum precision sensing, and brain-inspired neural networks.</description>

      <title>Learning Thermoelectric Transport from Crystal Structures via Multiscale Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to extract latent patterns from graph-structured data, making them particularly well suited for crystal representation learning. Here, we propose a GNN model tailored for estimating electronic transport coefficients in inorganic thermoelectric crystals. The model encodes crystal structures and physicochemical properties in a multiscale manner, encompassing global, atomic, bond, and angular levels. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with remarkable extrapolative capability. By combining the proposed GNN with \textit{ab initio} calculations, we successfully identify compounds exhibiting outstanding electronic transport properties and further perform interpretability analyses from both global and atomic perspectives, tracing the origins of their distinct transport behaviors. Interestingly, the decision process of the model naturally reveals underlying physical patterns, offering new insights into computer-assisted materials design.</description>

      <title>Does Fermi Level Alignment Hold Across Organic Interfaces? -- An Investigation Using a Rotary Kelvin Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding energy level alignment at organic interfaces is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic devices. Interface dipole and band bending significantly influence carrier recombination and generation mechanisms. A method of simulating energy level alignment at metal/organic and organic/organic interfaces by assuming a thermal equilibrium model has been proposed, but its validation against experimental methods is still limited. In this study, the work function change in the $\alpha$-NPD/HAT-CN/Au interface was measured as a typical donor/acceptor system using a rotary Kelvin probe (RKP). Our findings demonstrate good agreement with simulations only at metal/organic interfaces which have "active" charge transfer. It is suggested that thermal equilibrium is not achieved simply by depositing the film under dark condition, and some treatment to supply carriers, such as exposure to UV light, is necessary for accurate evaluation. At the organic/organic interface, the the experimental results did not agree with thermal equilibrium model, highlighting the need to consider substrate-driven carrier supply and polarization effects when evaluating energy level alignment.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystals Heterostructures based on Halide Perovskites and Metal Sulfides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of nanocrystal heterostructures composed of CsPbCl3 and PbS domains sharing an epitaxial interface. We were able to promote the growth of a PbS domain (in competition with the more commonly observed Pb4S3Cl2 one) on top of the CsPbCl3 domain by employing Mn2$^+$ ions, the latter acting most likely as scavengers of Cl$^-$ ions. Complete suppression of the Pb4S3Cl2 domain growth was then achieved by additionally selecting an appropriate sulfur source (bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, which also acted as scavenger of Cl$^-$ ions), and reaction temperature. In the heterostructures, emission from the perovskite domain was quenched, while emission from the PbS domain was observed, pointing to a type-I band alignment, as confirmed by calculations. These heterostructures in turn could be exploited to prepare second-generation heterostructures through selective ion exchange on the individual domains (halide ion exchange on CsPbCl3, cation exchange on PbS). We demonstrate the cases of Cl$^-$ to Br$^-$ and Pb2$^+$ to Cu$^+$ exchanges, which deliver CsPbBr3@PbS and CsPbCl3@Cu2-xS epitaxial heterostructures, respectively.</description>

      <title>Halide Perovskite-Chalcohalide Nanocrystal Heterostructures as a Platform for the Synthesis and Investigation of the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 Epitaxial Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide exchange in lead-based halide perovskites has been studied extensively. While mixed Cl-Br or Br-I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl-I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl and I ionic radii. Here, we exploit perovskite-chalcohalide CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures to study the Cl-I exchange and isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type-I, with carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted extensive attention due to their considerable luminescence efficiency, wide color gamut, high color purity, and facile material synthesis. Since the first demonstration of LEDs based on MAPbBr3 nanocrystals were reported in 2014, the community has witnessed a rapid development in their performances. In this review, we provide a historical perspective of the development of LEDs based on halide perovskite nanocrystals and then present a comprehensive survey of current strategies to high-efficiency lead-based perovskite nanocrystals LEDs, including synthesis optimization, ion doping/alloying and shell coating. We then review the basic characteristics and emission mechanisms of lead-free perovskite and perovskite-related nanocrystals emitters in environmentally friendly LEDs, from the standpoint of different emission colors. Finally, we cover the progress in LED applications and provide an outlook of the opportunities and challenges for future developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Polaron-Driven Spin Funneling through Rashba-Split Bands in Mixed-Phase Quasi-Two-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-Infrared (NIR) light emitting metal halides are emerging as a new generation of optical materials owing to their appealing features, which include low-cost synthesis, solution processability and adjustable optical properties. NIR emitting perovskite-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, we summarize several different types of NIR-emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, and assess their recent advancements. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow-band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. We also highlight the various applications of NIR-emitting metal halides and provide an outlook for the field.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Boundaries of the Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor with Ethylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) colloidal nanocrystals as another member of the lead halide perovskites family. The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harvesting low-grade heat to electricity is attractive for powering wearable electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate nW-scale thermoelectric power generation in devices from thin film assemblies of microwave-synthesized p-Sb2Te3 nanoplates and n-Ag2Te nanowires on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. While microwave cycling is crucial for Ag2Te nanocrystal shaping, Sb2Te3 formation is sensitive to precursors and surfactant concentrations. Introducing S doping in Sb2Te3 in the 1 - 1.5 atomic percent range via thioglycolic acid during synthesis yields an up to eightfold higher power-factor, due to a fivefold increase in electrical conductivity and 25% increase in Seebeck coefficient. Our microfilm devices generate up to 33.6 mV from 5 deg C to 50 deg C thermal gradients, with 120 nW maximum power output at Delta T 30 deg C, which is sixtyfold higher than Sb2Te3 paper devices. Mechanical bending can increase device resistance by up to 125% due to diminished inter-nanostructure electronic transport. These findings provide insights for integrating synthesis, morphology engineering and device design for next-generation wearable thermoelectric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ attract considerable interest due to their high Curie temperatures (up to $710$K), which strongly depend on the A-site cation. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate their electronic structure and magnetic exchange interactions. A band mechanism of magnetism that explains the antiferromagnetic character of the exchange interactions and their strong dependence on the filling of the Re $t_{2g}$ states is proposed. These antiferromagnetic interactions stabilize ferrimagnetic ground state. The calculated Curie temperatures, obtained within the Onsager reaction field theory, are in a good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Observation of Stable Bimeron Transport Driven by Spoof Surface Acoustic Waves on Chiral Metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quasiparticles, such as merons and bimerons, are characterized by non-trivial textures that exhibit remarkably robust transport against deformation, offering significant potential for information processing. While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge.

      <title>Spontaneous Transition from Conformal to Two-Dimensional Growth in Ge/GeSn Core/Shell Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeSn semiconductors are group-IV isovalent alloys that offer remarkable tunability of optoelectronic properties across the entire infrared spectrum, while remaining fully compatible with silicon processing standards. These attributes make GeSn a promising platform for scalable sensing, imaging, and communication technologies. Yet, the influence of dimensionality on GeSn crystal growth remains poorly understood, limiting the development of integrated nanoscale infrared devices. Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure. The fins exhibit uniform Sn incorporation of approximately 16 at.% throughout their volume, indicating high compositional homogeneity. These findings uncover an anisotropic growth regime in metastable GeSn alloys, enriching the fundamental understanding of nanoscale epitaxy.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Driven Exciton Behavior in 2D Halide Perovskites from Dielectric-Dependent Hybrid Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how dielectric anisotropy governs excitonic behavior in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites is critical for predicting and engineering their optoelectronic properties. In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments. The results establish a clear correlation between dielectric anisotropy, electronic structure, and exciton binding energy at different timescales in layered perovskites, providing essential insight for the design of 2D optoelectronic materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics and Thermal Transport in Layered Perovskite LiYTiO4 Anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered perovskite lithium yttrium titanate ($\rm LiYTiO_4$) has recently emerged as a promising low-potential, ultrahigh-rate intercalation-type anode material for lithium-ion batteries; however, its lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties remain poorly understood, limiting a complete evaluation of its practical potential. Here, we combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat transport in $\rm LiYTiO_4$. We employ a neural evolution potential (NEP)-based framework that integrates the temperature-dependent effective potential method with the Wigner thermal transport (WTT) formalism, explicitly including both diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the heat-flux operator. Zero-temperature phonon calculations reveal dynamical instabilities associated with $\rm TiO_6$ octahedral rotation, which are stabilized at finite temperatures through anharmonic renormalization. Using the WTT approach with contributions from phonon propagation and coherence contributions, we predict a room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) of 3.8 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ averaged over all crystal orientations, in close agreement with the measured value of 3.2 \pm 0.08 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ for polycrystalline samples. To further examine the possible influence of ionic motion on high-temperature thermal transport, we compute $\kappa_{\rm L}$ using a Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics approach based on the same NEP, which yields consistent results with both experiment and WTT predictions, confirming the negligible role of Li-ion mobility in heat conduction. Our study not only identifies the ultralow thermal conductivity of $\rm LiYTiO_4$ as a key limitation for its practical application but also establishes a reliable computational framework for studying thermal properties in battery materials.</description>

      <title>Remote epitaxial frustration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote epitaxy relaxes the constraints of conventional epitaxy, to enable low defect density, chemically abrupt heterostructures and exfoliation of single crystalline membranes. However, definitive evidence for a true remote mechanism remains elusive because most experiments can be explained by alternative mechanism that are macroscopically indistinguishable from true remote epitaxy. Using GdAuGe films grown on graphene/SiC (0001), we present two signatures that cannot be explained by the leading alternatives to the remote mechanism: (1) a few atomic layer thick disordered interlayer at the GdAuGe/graphene interface and (2) a $30\degree$ rotated epitaxial relationship between the GdAuGe film and the SiC substrate. Density functional theory calculations indicate these signatures arise from remote epitaxial \textit{frustration}, a competition amongst epitaxy to the remotely screened substrate, to graphene, and to the graphene-induced interfacial reconstruction. Tuning the amplitudes and periodicities of these competing potentials provides new opportunities to intentionally disrupt long-range order.</description>

      <title>Photodynamics and Temperature Dependence of Single Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures have recently garnered significant attention as an emerging solid-state platform for quantum technologies. However, the underlying spin dynamics, and the mechanisms determining the spin-dependent fluorescence in these defects are still poorly understood. In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures. These insights are crucial for further understanding of the spin dynamics of quantum emitters in hBN and their practical implementation in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the theory of crystal polarization: The downside of employing the periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic boundary condition (PBC) is a standard approximation for calculating crystalline materials properties. However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal charge transport in an iron-based superconductor with broken inversion symmetry engineered by a hydrogen-concentration gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breaking of spatial inversion symmetry in condensed matter gives rise to intriguing physical properties, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, spin-momentum locking, and nonreciprocal responses. Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Magnetism in UH2 Thin Films Studied by X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dihydride UH2 is a metastable phase unknown in bulk form but accessible through thin-film synthesis. We prepared UH2 films by reactive dc sputtering on CaF2(001) or Si(001) substrates, the latter equipped with a Mo buffer layer to suppress a U-Si interdiffusion. On CaF2, UH2 adopts the fluorite-type structure with a near-[1 1 1] out-of-plane texture, four rotational domains, and a lattice parameter a = 539 +- 3 pm without measurable strain, whereas the Mo-buffered film is polycrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed complete hydrogenation and minimal oxidation. Magnetization and XMCD measurements show ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperatures of 120-130 K and a uranium 5f moment of 0.9 {\mu}B/U, dominated by the orbital contribution ({\mu}L ~ 1.4 {\mu}B, {\mu}S ~ -0.5 {\mu}B), in a good agreement with GGA+U computations, which otherwise overestimate absolute values of the spin and orbital components. The slightly reduced moment in thinner CaF2-supported films is attributed to surface U(IV) species. These results demonstrate that thin-film synthesis enables stabilization of UH2 and direct probing of 5f magnetism, opening pathways toward higher uranium hydrides and interface-engineered actinide systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B -- a widely used permanent magnet -- has magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants that differ between the bulk and interface regions. This study explores the effects of lattice distortion on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B. Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B alloys were fabricated; scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries. Using the full-potential Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker method, we calculated the strain dependence of $K_{\rm u}$, showing that although $K_{\rm u}$ is 4.2 MJ/m$^3$ under strain-free conditions at 0 K, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. Additionally, Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B exhibits a larger $K_{\rm u}$ than Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B under undistorted conditions, whereas Pr-rich alloys exhibit a more pronounced reduction in $K_{\rm u}$ under strain. These findings highlight the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties. The calculated strain-dependent magnetic anisotropy parameters provide valuable inputs for future micromagnetic simulations, aiding the design of advanced magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addressing the challenge of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), symmetry-aware deep learning models, particularly diffusion models, have been extensively studied, which treat CSP as a conditional generation task. However, ensuring permutation, rotation, and periodic translation equivariance during diffusion process remains incompletely addressed. In this work, we propose EquiCSP, a novel equivariant diffusion-based generative model. We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster convergence during the training process.</description>

      <title>Multiplet structure of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids.</description>

      <title>Improving the Stability of Colloidal CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with an Alkylphosphonium Bromide as Surface Ligand Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we synthesised a phosphonium-based ligand, trimethyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bromide (TTP-Br), and employed it in the post-synthesis surface treatment of Cs-oleate-capped CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the NCs increased from 60% to more than 90%, as a consequence of replacing Cs-oleate with TTP-Br ligand pairs. Density functional theory calculations revealed that TTP+ ions bind to the NC surface by occupying Cs+ surface sites and orienting one of their P-CH3 bonds perpendicular to the surface, akin to quaternary ammonium passivation. Importantly, TTP-Br-capped NCs exhibited higher stability in air compared to didodecyldimethylammonium bromide-capped CsPbBr3 NCs (which is considered a benchmark system), retaining 90% of their PLQY after six weeks of air exposure. Light-emitting diodes fabricated with TTP-Br-capped NCs achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.2 %, demonstrating the potential of phosphonium-based molecules as surface ligands for CsPbBr3 NCs in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>First principle study of electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) full Heusler: Application to embedded automotive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Alteraxial Phonons in Collinear Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized or axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum have attracted considerable interest. These phonons have finite magnetic moment and can couple to internal magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons. We have also performed ab initio calculations on representative materials to validate the proposed magneto-alteraxial phonon spectra and PAM patterns. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Separation of Hoke and Schottky effects for improvement of mixed halide perovskite solar cell stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion migration in halide perovskites is a key factor limiting the operational stability of solar cells due to formation of halogen ion enriched domains and accumulation layers. The present work demonstrates the manifestation of ion migration in two ways via Hoke and Schottky effects. Both effects are induced by external exposure but have its peculiar way of solar cell performance degradation. We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness. A thick transport layer blocks losses of charge-carrier selectivity in a solar cell and leads to an enormous increase of T80 time, from 15 seconds up to 60 minutes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Screening Effects on Auger Recombination in Metal-Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of modern light-emitting technologies, from lasers to LEDs, is limited by nonradiative losses, with Auger recombination being the dominant channel at device-relevant carrier densities. Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, computed from low-scaling \textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\approx1.73$ eV) and $\gamma$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared intraband transitions in InAs colloidal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: III-V colloidal quantum dots are widely studied for their applications as detectors and emitters from visible to short-wave infrared. They might also be used in the mid-infrared if they can be stably n-doped to access their intraband transitions. Mid-infrared intraband transitions are therefore studied for InAs, InAs/InP, and InAs/ZnSe colloidal quantum dots with an energy gap at 1.4 micron. Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Studies on O2-P2 Phase-Transition Dynamics in Layered-Oxide Sodium-Ion Cathode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have gained much interest over the past years and especially layered oxides are highly considered as cathodes for the next generation of batteries. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome in these materials for practical applications mainly related to capacity degradation and voltage fading. A key influence factor for these challenges are phase transitions that occur by gliding of layers during operation of these materials. Until now there is limited atomistic-level understanding on such transitions as simulations of these processes are computationally demanding. In this work, we trained a classical pairwise Coulomb-Buckingham potential versus extensive \textit{ab initio} data using a genetic algorithm to study O2-P2 phase transitions in Na\textsubscript{\textit{x}}CoO\textsubscript{2}. Our density functional theory~(DFT) and classical potential calculations show that phase transition barriers decrease upon desodiation and are further lowered if dynamic conditions are considered through molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed classical potential is able to capture phase transitions and its related increase in the Na-ion diffusivity under standard lab conditions at the $\upmu$s timescale of molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, it is found that the phase transition occurs gradually \textit{via} various OP\textit{n} phases.</description>

      <title>Network of localized magnetic textures revealed using a saddle-point search framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational framework is presented for the sampling of the energy surface of magnetic systems via the systematic identification of first-order saddle points that determine connectivity of metastable states and define the mechanisms of transitions between them. The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state.</description>

      <title>Bimorph Lithium Niobate Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Tensor Trains for accelerated Quantum-Inspired Homogenization on TPU, GPU and CPU architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.</description>

      <title>Intralayer antiferromagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, although a ferromagnetic ground state has been reported, there are also reports of complex magnetic behavior suggesting coexistence of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism due to the intricate interaction between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ ions in this system. The exact nature of the interactions and the origin of antiferromagnetism are still under debate. Here, we report the observation of signature of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings between different Fe-ions in the anomalous Hall effect measured for devices of mechanically exfoliated Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ nano-flakes of thicknesses ranging from\,$\sim$\,15-20 layers. The temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect data reveal two sharp step-like switchings at low temperature ($T\lesssim150\,$K). Our detailed analyses suggest the step-like sharp switchings in anomalous Hall resistance are due to the magnetization reversal behavior of different Fe-ions in individual layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The experimental results can be explained by considering an intra-layer antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+3}$ ions, whereas intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ in the system. Our experimental results and the analyses are supported by the first-principles calculations for energetics and intralayer as well as interlayer exchange coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solution-processed electrochromic materials offer high potential for energy-efficient smart windows and displays. Their performance varies with material choice and processing conditions. Electrochromic thin film electrodes require a smooth, defect-free coating for optimal contrast between bleached and colored states. The complexity of optimizing the spin-coated electrochromic thin layer poses challenges for rapid development. This study demonstrates the use of self-driving laboratories to accelerate the development of electrochromic coatings by coupling automation with machine learning. Our system combines automated data acquisition, image processing, spectral analysis, and Bayesian optimization to explore processing parameters efficiently. This approach not only increases throughput but also enables a pointed search for optimal processing parameters. The approach can be applied to various solution-processed materials, highlighting the potential of self-driving labs in enhancing materials discovery and process optimization.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear fusion in the sub-keV energy regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion requires overcoming or traversing a repulsive Coulomb barrier of hundreds of kiloelectronvolts, rendering the probability of fusion at sub-keV energies vanishingly small. Yet in condensed matter, the electronic and structural environment of reacting nuclei can profoundly alter fusion rates. Here we demonstrate that deuterium-deuterium fusion within metallic foils exhibits a pronounced enhancement and reaction yield plateau below energies of 2.5 keV- contrary to the expected exponential suppression with decreasing energy. Using a dual-chamber platform that combines electrochemical deuterium loading with ion-beam bombardment, we show that fusion yields in palladium and titanium hydrides are enhanced by over 10^18 compared to theoretical bare-nucleus fusion rates. These results demonstrate that access to low-energy fusion processes can be governed by materials degrees of freedom. This materials-driven fusion regime establishes a reproducible, tunable framework for studying and ultimately engineering nuclear reactions in solids. While the reaction rates reported here are low, these insights into materials-modulated fusion processes offer a potential foundation for understanding how condensed-matter environments could influence future fusion-energy concepts.</description>

      <title>Effect of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Anomalous Quantum Oscillations in InAs/GaSb Quantum Wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on anomalous quantum oscillations in InAs/GaSb quantum wells. By comparing different cases, we show that SOC induces two opposing effects on anomalous quantum oscillations: it suppresses the oscillations in the clean case, while enhancing them in the disordered case. Using an effective model, we analyze in detail the origins of anomalous oscillations in both clean and disordered cases. Based on these origins, we explain why SOC suppresses or enhances the anomalous oscillations in different cases, thereby extending the understanding of the conventional theory. Moreover, in the disordered case, SOC can induce a phase shift of the anomalous oscillations. We further identify a parameter window where the anomalous oscillations are significantly enhanced in the presence of both disorder and SOC. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the role of SOC in anomalous quantum oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional carbon nitride materials have been the center of attention for their diverse usage in energy harvesting, environmental remediation and nanoelectronic applications. A broad range of utilities with decent synthetic plausibility have made this family a sweet spot to dive into, whereas the underlying analytical aspects are yet to have prominence. Recently, using the machinaries of first principles, we reported a family of six different structures C3NX with a unique dumbbell-shaped morphology, functionalizing the recently synthesized monolayer of C3N. Here we have critically explored the non-trivial topological phases of the semimetallic Dumbbell C3NX sheets and nanoribbons. Spin-orbit coupling induced gap across the Fermi level, its subsequent tuning via an external electric field, portrayal of band inversion from the Berry curvature distribution and the evaluation of topological index using the Wannier charge center (WCC) firmly establishes the traces of topological footprint. The real space decimation scheme and Green function technique evaluate the underlying spectral information with corresponding transport characteristics. Fascinating features of these quasi-1D systems are observed utilizing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where different twisted phases reveal distinct topological signatures even in a low atomic mass system like DB C4N.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Transition of SiV$^-$ in Diamond to an Optically Dark State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers in diamond (SiV$^-$) are promising for quantum photonic technologies. However, when subject to resonant optical excitation, they can inadvertently transfer into a zero-spin optically dark state. We show that this unwanted change of charge state can be quickly reversed by the resonant laser itself in combination with static electric fields. By defining interdigitated metallic contacts on the diamond surface, we increase the steady-state SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under resonant excitation by a factor $\ge3$ for most emitters, making it practically constant for certain individual emitters. We electrically activate single \sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role. Our proposed electric-field-based stabilization scheme enhances deterministic charge state control in group-IV color centers and improves its understanding, offering a scalable path toward quantum applications such as entanglement generation and quantum key distribution.</description>

Abstract: Predictive atomistic simulations have propelled materials discovery, yet routine setup and debugging still demand computer specialists. This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline. Compared with LLM-only baselines, GENIUS halves inference costs and virtually eliminates hallucinations. The framework democratizes electronic-structure DFT simulations by intelligently automating protocol generation, validation, and repair, opening large-scale screening and accelerating ICME design loops across academia and industry worldwide.</description>

      <title>Interface controlled Berry phase and anisotropic spin-charge conversion in altermagnet-topological insulator bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an altermagnet-topological insulator bilayer as a platform to engineer Berry phase driven spin-charge responses using an interfacial buffer layer. Using a momentum-space lattice model and linear-response theory, we investigate a $d$-wave altermagnet coupled to a topological insulator and highlight the crucial role of spin-flip tunneling in shaping its electronic and transport properties. Interfacial hybridization strongly modifies the band structure, leading to anisotropic Rashba-Edelstein and Hall responses. The spin-flip component of the coupling induces an inverse $d$-wave spin texture in the altermagnetic bands, signaling the onset of an altermagnetic topological phase. This coupling also renders the Rashba-Edelstein effect strongly in-plane anisotropic, enhancing the transverse response relative to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic analogues. These results establish interfacial spin-flip tunneling as a practical control knob for direction-sensitive, stray-field-free spin-charge conversion in correlated topological heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Robust Superconductivity and High Upper Critical Fields in Epitaxial cubic W2N Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition Metal Nitrides are a versatile class of materials, combining chemical robustness, high hardness, and superconducting behaviour with critical temperatures between 2 to 10 K. While several binary TMNs have been explored, superconductivity in stoichiometric W2N has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report on superconducting thin films of stoichiometric W2N, demonstrating a distinctly high upper critical field of 8.5 T, uncommon among binary TMNs. This robust superconducting response under high magnetic fields highlights the technological relevance of W2N for integrated quantum and cryogenic electronic platforms. Overall, these results position stoichiometric W2N as a promising addition to the TMN superconducting landscape, opening new avenues for functional materials design based on chemically stable and mechanically resilient nitrides.</description>

      <title>Giant optical anisotropy and visible-frequency epsilon-near-zero in hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of extreme optical anisotropy is foundational to nanoscale light manipulation. Van der Waals (vdW) crystal MoOCl2 has emerged as a promising candidate for this quest, hosting hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. However, the fundamental anisotropic dielectric tensor governing this behavior has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this problem by providing the first experimental determination of the full dielectric tensor of hyperbolic vdW MoOCl2. Via spectroscopic ellipsometry, Mueller matrix, and reflectance measurements, we quantify the material's optical duality: a metallic optical response ({\epsilon}_1 &lt; 0) along the crystallographic a-axis and a dielectric response ({\epsilon}_1 &gt; 0) along the orthogonal directions. This dichotomy drives an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition at \approx 512 nm and results in giant in-plane birefringence of \delta n \approx 2.2 for MoOCl2. As a result, our work provides the critical missing experimental parameters for MoOCl2, establishing it as a benchmark hyperbolic and ENZ material.</description>

      <title>Full Electrical Switching of a Freestanding Ferrimagnetic Metal for Energy-Efficient Bipolar Neuromorphic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible electronics and neuromorphic computing face key challenges in material integration and function retention. In particular, freestanding membranes suffer from slow sacrificial layer removal and interfacial strain, while neuromorphic hardware often relies on area-intensive dual-device schemes for bipolar synaptic weights. Here, we present a universal strategy based on water-soluble Sr4Al2O7 sacrificial layers, enabling the rapid release of freestanding ferrimagnetic metal membranes, which exhibit deterministic spin-orbit torque switching characteristics with well-preserved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and are potential for next-generation ultrafast information technology. Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching. When implemented in a ResNet-18 architecture, these devices achieve 92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 - comparable to floating-point software models - while halving device counts relative to differential-pair implementations. These results establish a scalable platform linking flexible spintronics with compact, high-performance neuromorphic systems, offering foundational advances for next-generation electronics and brain-inspired hardware.</description>

      <title>Surface energy-driven crumpling transition in a thin sheet under compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our common experience, crumpling a sheet requires external compressive force and leads to a random network of folds. However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets.</description>

      <title>OXtal: An All-Atom Diffusion Model for Organic Crystal Structure Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting experimentally-realizable 3D molecular crystal structures from their 2D chemical graphs is a long-standing open challenge in computational chemistry called crystal structure prediction (CSP). Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, OXtal recovers experimental structures with conformer $\text{RMSD}_1&lt;0.5$ {\AA} and attains over 80\% packing similarity rate, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Bulk Interplay in Nonlinear Topological Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport has emerged as a powerful approach to probe the quantum geometry of electronic wavefunctions, such as Berry curvature and quantum metric, in topological materials. While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Screening in Nanotubes: A Tubular Response Function Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and transport of electrolytes in nanoscale channels are known to be affected by the electronic properties of the confining walls. This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in two-dimensional materials provide a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated and topological phases. This work presents a practical theoretical workflow for studying the correlated and topological states in moir\'e systems, combining continuum modeling, Hartree-Fock mean-field approximations, many-body perturbation theory, and exact diagonalizations. We focus on the numerical implementation of these methods, emphasizing subtleties such as remote band effects, inhomogeneous and dynamical screening, double counting problem, etc., which are often swept under the rug in theoretical works. The workflow enables a systematic investigation of symmetry-breaking ground state properties, quasiparticle excitation properties and fractional Chern insulator phases emerging from moir\'e superlattices, providing insights that are directly relevant to experimental observations. By bridging technical details and physical interpretations, this work aims to guide both theorists and experimentalists in understanding and predicting correlated phenomena in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic signatures of Chern number sign reversal in twisted bilayer WSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of quantized Chern numbers in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers,including 3.7{deg} twisted MoTe2 and 1.23{deg} twisted WSe2,has emerged as a defining breakthrough in physics. A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements.</description>

      <title>Edge-Aware Graph Attention Model for Structural Optimization of High Entropy Carbides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting relaxed atomic structures of chemically complex materials remains a major computational challenge, particularly for high-entropy systems where traditional first-principles methods become prohibitively expensive. We introduce the edge-aware graph attention model, a physics-informed graph neural network tailored for predicting relaxed atomic structures of high-entropy systems. the edge-aware graph attention model employs chemically and geometrically informed descriptors that capture both atomic properties and local structural environments. To effectively capture atomic interactions, our model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism that adaptively weighs neighbouring atoms using both node and edge features. This edge-aware attention framework learn complex chemical and structural relationships independent of global orientation or position. We trained and evaluated the edge-aware GAT model on a dataset of carbide systems, spanning binary to high-entropy carbide compositions, and demonstrated its accuracy, convergence efficiency, and transferability. The architecture is lightweight, with a very low computational footprint, making it highly suitable for large-scale materials screening. By providing invariance to rigid-body transformations and leveraging domain-informed attention mechanisms, our model delivers a fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to DFT, enabling accelerated discovery and screening of entropy-stabilised materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects arise in many complex systems, from protein folding, to the spreading of epidemics and financial decisions. While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Materium: An Autoregressive Approach for Material Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Materium: an autoregressive transformer for generating crystal structures that converts 3D material representations into token sequences. These sequences include elements with oxidation states, fractional coordinates and lattice parameters. Unlike diffusion approaches, which refine atomic positions iteratively through many denoising steps, Materium places atoms at precise fractional coordinates, enabling fast, scalable generation. With this design, the model can be trained in a few hours on a single GPU and generate samples much faster on GPUs and CPUs than diffusion-based approaches. The model was trained and evaluated using multiple properties as conditions, including fundamental properties, such as density and space group, as well as more practical targets, such as band gap and magnetic density. In both single and combined conditions, the model performs consistently well, producing candidates that align with the requested inputs.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Kekul\'{e} bond order and lattice instability in $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between charge order and lattice instability in quantum materials remains a central challenge, as their coexistence often obscures causal relationships. This work introduces $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a novel platform to investigate charge order mediated by two distinct mechanisms. We show that the hybridization between carbon $\pi$ and lithium $s$ orbitals generates an effective long-range hopping within Li-centered hexagons. This hopping drives a Kekul\'{e} bond order, whose structure varies with charge density and the sign of the hopping. This bond order induces a Kekul\'{e} lattice distortion via electron-phonon coupling. In the limit where lithium atoms are distant from the graphene layer, a Fermi surface nesting-driven Kekul\'{e} bond order emerges, stabilized by the electron-phonon interaction. Our results establish $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a tunable platform for elucidating the causal hierarchy between electronic and structural orders in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-Texture Spin-valve with a van der Waals Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.</description>

      <title>Optimization for growth condition of ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride on dielectric substrates via LPCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) is a highly intriguing candidate for heterostructure optoelectronic applications, such as Deep Ultraviolet photodetectors, UV sensing and communication systems and solar cells. This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication.</description>

      <title>Extreme Strain Controlled Correlated Metal-Insulator Transition in the Altermagnet CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts.</description>

      <title>Local Symmetry Breaking in Skyrmion-Hosting Centrosymmetric Hexagonal Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the exotic topologically stable skyrmion spin textures in the noncentrosymmetric crystals. The recent discovery of biskyrmions and skyrmions in the globally centrosymmetric crystals has raised debate about the role of the DMI in causing the spin textures, since DMI vanishes in such crystal structures. Theoretical studies, on the other hand, suggest non-vanishing DMI even if there is local inversion symmetry breaking in an otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystal structure. Motivated by such theoretical predictions, we present here the results of a systematic crystal structure study of two skyrmion-hosting Ni2In-type centrosymmetric hexagonal compounds, MnNiGa and MnPtGa, using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique. Our result provides information about structural correlations in the short-range (SR), medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) regimes simultaneously. The analysis of the experimental PDFs, obtained from high flux, high energy, and high Q synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction patterns, reveals that the local SR structure of both MnNiGa and MnPtGa compounds corresponds to the noncentrosymmetric trigonal space group P3m1, while the structure in the MR+LR regimes remains hexagonal in the centrosymmetric P63/mmc space group. These findings are also supported by theoretical DFT calculations. Our results, in conjunction with the previous theoretical predictions, provide a rationale for the genesis of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials in terms of non-vanishing DMI due to local inversion symmetry breaking. We believe that our findings would encourage a systematic search of skyrmionic textures and other topological phenomena in a vast family of centrosymmetric materials.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity and large internal surface area, provide versatile platforms for integrating spin centers with potential applications in catalysis and quantum sensing. Here, we identify a stable NH radical spin center in UiO-66-NH2, a zirconium-based MOF with aminoterephthalic acid (TPA-NH2) linkers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH2 linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH2 family.</description>

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some two-dimensional systems. In this study, we imaged silver iodide embedded in multilayer graphene using time- and temperature-resolved in situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observed the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.</description>

Abstract: Construction of transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials with a minimal number of parameters is important for their general applicability. Here, we present a machine-learning interatomic potential with the functional form of the bond-order potential for comprehensive exploration over the configuration space of carbon. The physics-based design of this potential enables robust and accurate description over a wide range of the potential energy surface with a small number of parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of this potential through validations across various tasks, including phonon dispersion calculations, global structure searches for clusters, phase diagram calculations, and enthalpy-volume mappings of local minima structures. We expect that this potential can contribute to the discovery of novel carbon materials.</description>

      <title>Critical Structural Parameter Determining Magnetic Phases in the Fe2Mo3O8 Altermagnet System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic-field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural, between two distinct altermagnet states, and is accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8,0&lt;y&lt;1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be cleanly tuned by pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching in films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state platforms based on bosonic quasiparticles offer a compelling route toward on-chip quantum information technologies scalable to nanometer dimensions. Coherence time, a key figure of merit for any quantum system, is fundamentally limited by the lifetime of quasiparticles that store quantum information. For magnons - bosonic excitations of collective magnetization dynamics - it has long been reported that their lifetime does not exceed a few hundred nanoseconds, placing a stringent constraint on their use in quantum architectures. Here, we demonstrate magnon lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s. Experiments performed on single-crystal yttrium iron garnet spheres cooled to 30 mK reveal relaxation times of short-wavelength magnons nearly two orders of magnitude longer than previously observed. These findings overturn the established view of magnon dissipation limits, positioning magnons as viable, long-lived information carriers for solid-state quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic defects as a source of $\textit{n}$-type conductivity in CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling native defects is essential for unlocking the full potential of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Here, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations are used to explore the electronic properties of bulk CrSBr. ARPES measurements reveal clear signatures of conduction band filling in as-grown crystals, indicative of unintentional doping. An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies. Our results shed light on the origin of unintentional $\textit{n}$-type doping of CrSBr and pave the way for new strategies for defect control and electronic property tuning in this van der Waals magnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hartree--Fock analysis of the ground-state electronic structure of the finite spherical jellium model is carried out for systems containing up to $520$ electrons in a positive background field with densities ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $1$. The study focuses on quantifying the effects of confinement on the local-density models of the exchange and kinetic energies used in orbital-free density-based quantum computation methods. Significant discrepancies are observed between the energies obtained from the Hartree--Fock approximation and those predicted by the local density approximation (LDA) and the Thomas--Fermi model (TF) evaluated at the computed electron densities, both in the inner region and on the surface of the system. To reconcile these differences, refined expressions for the local one-electron energy densities, parametrized by the system's size and background charge density, are proposed.

      <title>A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering from semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on Ge(111)$c(2\times8)$, for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent-electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model, and validate these results through numerically exact quantum-dynamical simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach. While mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface.</description>

      <title>Hidden Moir\'e Topology of Low-Symmetry Weyl Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological materials are defined by the correspondence between bulk topology and boundary states, yet this correspondence becomes enigmatic on low-symmetry surfaces where bulk and surface periodicities are inherently mismatched. Here we reveal a hidden moir\'e topology emerging on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncovers closed Fermi-arc loops and momentum-space moir\'e modulations, phenomena unanticipated in conventional topological theory. We show that these emerge from incomplete bulk projection and multi-cell interference governed by a least-common-multiple framework. Least-common-multiple guided DFT and Green's-function calculations quantitatively reproduce the observed spectra, establishing the universality of this commensuration rule. These findings transform a long-standing paradox of bulk-boundary correspondence into a new paradigm of momentum-space moir\'e reconstruction, bridging crystalline and quasicrystalline topologies and opening routes to flat-band engineering on complex surfaces.</description>

      <title>All-optical magnetization reversal via x-ray magnetic circular dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region.</description>

Abstract: Tailoring at will polar textures in ferroelectrics is critical for the development of nanoscale electronics and functional oxide technologies. Freestanding ferroelectric membranes have enabled studies of strain-induced polarization responses, but the control over membrane shape and local polarization typically remains limited to spontaneous buckling or uniaxial mechanical deformations. In this work, we employ a versatile photosensitive-polymer patterning approach to impose programmable bending strain profiles in ferroelectric membranes. Using BaTiO3 as a model system, we demonstrate deterministic 90{\deg} polarization rotation driven by engineered in-plane strain, and 180{\deg} polarization reversal arising from flexoelectric coupling through a controlled strain gradient. These results establish this programmable bending as a powerful approach to investigate strain-dependent domain structures, leverage flexoelectric effects, and engineer custom ferroelectric landscapes across a wide range of oxide membranes.</description>

      <title>A Dimensionally Consistent Size-Strain Plot Method for Crystallite Size and Microstrain Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening analysis remains a cornerstone for quantifying crystallite size and lattice microstrain in materials. Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. However, this study reveals that the equation most commonly applied in SSP analysis is dimensionally inconsistent, a critical flaw that has gone largely unnoticed and replicated across decades of materials research. This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \en</description>

      <title>Competing Lattice and Defect Dynamics Govern Terahertz-Induced Ferroelectricity in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intense terahertz (THz) pulses induce transient inversion-symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$, yet the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Using fields up to $\sim$1.1 MV/cm, we reveal spatially inhomogeneous THz-field-induced second harmonic generation (TFISH) governed by competing lattice and defect dynamics. Short-lived coherent antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes suppress dipole correlations within $\sim$5 ps, while heavily damped soft/AFD modes and a defect-induced low-frequency mode ($\sim$0.1-0.3 THz) jointly prevent long-range ferroelectric coherence in oxygen-vacancy-rich regions. Collective modes manifested by oscillatory TFISH components exhibit softening followed by hardening below a critical temperature $T^*\simeq$28 K, confirming transient ferroelectric order where defects are sparse. These results reconcile conflicting interpretations, establish defect-mediated competition as a central regulator of light-induced ferroelectricity, and open routes to ultrafast control of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanoscale Molecular Organization in Liquid Crystals via Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural flexibility and multifunctional nature of double perovskite oxides make them attractive for applications requiring coupled optical, mechanical, and thermal performance. Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

      <title>Revealing interstitial energetics in Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy via universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of light interstitial elements in multicomponent alloys remains challenging due to the complexity of local chemical environments and the high computational cost of first-principles calculations. Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability.</description>

Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</description>

      <title>Activation of anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization by domain walls in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of unconventional antiferromagnets, characterized by a N\'eel ordering that does not break the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice. Depending on the orientation of the N\'eel vector, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) may or may not exist. In the so-called pure altermagnets, AHE is forbidden by the magnetic symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in pure altermagnets, the domain walls can lift the symmetry constraints, thereby activating the AHE and orbital magnetization. Taking a representative example of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we use the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall AHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while the spin magnetization does not play a significant role. Using Landau theory, we argue that while for a random arrangement of $\pi$ domain walls, the contributions from the individual domain walls will cancel one another, an external magnetic field will favor domain-wall arrangements with specific chirality giving rise to a net AHE signal. Using group theory, we discuss how these findings can be generalized straightforwardly to certain other classes of altermagnets. Our work reveals a crucial role of the domain walls in the understanding of the Hall transport and orbital magnetism of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $\gamma$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</description>

Abstract: Exploring novel topological matters with exotic quantum states has always been a core issue in the field of condensed matter physics, which can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single band gap. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from the well-known first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Particularly, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and discover a three-dimensional unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both helical and corner topological states and exhibits an unprecedented bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07831</link>

Abstract: We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</description>

      <title>Integrating Macrostate Probability Distributions with Swing Adsorption Modeling for Binary/Ternary Gas Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enables high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</description>

      <title>Learning from the electronic structure of molecules across the periodic table</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.</description>

      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free or clamped edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Topological Defects in Ferroelectric Nematic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</description>
