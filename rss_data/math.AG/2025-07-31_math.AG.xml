      <title>Symmetric star transforms and the algebraic geometry of their dual differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star transform is a generalized Radon transform mapping a function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the function whose value at a point is the integral along a union of rays emanating from the point in a fixed set of directions, called branch vectors. We show that the injectivity and inversion properties of the star transform are connected to its dual differential operator, an object introduced in this paper. We prove that if the set of branch vectors forms a symmetric shape with respect to the action of a finite rotation group $G$, then the symbol of its dual differential operator belongs to the ring of $G$-invariant polynomials. Furthermore, we show that star transforms with degenerate symmetry correspond to linear subspaces contained in the zero set of certain elementary symmetric polynomials, and we investigate the associated real algebraic Fano varieties. In particular, non-invertible star transforms in dimension 2 correspond to certain real lines on the Cayley nodal cubic surface.</description>

      <title>The Kodaira dimension of even-dimensional ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n&gt;12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for prime discriminant $-D&lt;-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\operatorname{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n &gt; 207$, or $n&gt;12$ and $D&gt;2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our proof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of automorphic representations.</description>

      <title>Dimensional vanishing of the saturated de Rham-Witt complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturated de Rham-Witt complex, introduced by Bhatt-Lurie-Mathew in arXiv:1805.05501, is a variant of the classical de Rham-Witt complex which is expected to behave better for singular schemes. We provide partial justification for this expectation by showing that the saturated de Rham-Witt complex satisfies a dimensional vanishing property even in the presence of singularities. This is stronger than the vanishing properties of the classical de Rham-Witt complex, crystalline cohomology, or de Rham cohomology, and is instead comparable to \'etale cohomology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the structure of the coordinate ring of an affine ind-variety. We prove that any coordinate ring of an affine ind-variety which is not isomorphic to an affine algebraic variety does not have a countable set of generators. Also we prove that coordinate rings of affine ind-varieties have an everywhere dense subspace of countable dimension.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of zeroes of polynomials on weighted projective spaces over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the maximum number of rational points at which a homogeneous polynomial can vanish on a weighted projective space over a finite field, provided that the first weight is equal to one. This solves a conjecture by Aubry, Castryck, Ghorpade, Lachaud, O'Sullivan and Ram, which stated that a Serre-like bound holds with equality for weighted projective spaces when the first weight is one, and when considering polynomials whose degree is divisible by the least common multiple of the weights. We refine this conjecture by lifting the restriction on the degree and we prove it using footprint techniques, Delorme's reduction and Serre's classical bound.</description>

      <title>The Tate-Shafarevich group of a polarised K3 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper we generalised the notion of the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic K3 surface to the Tate-Shafarevich group of a polarised K3 surface. In the present note, we complement the result by proving that the Tate-Shafarevich group of a polarised K3 surface (S,h) with h primitive parametrises bijectively all torsors for the Jacobian of the generic curve in the linear system |h| that admit a good hyperk\"ahler compactification. The result is seen as the analogue of the classical fact that the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic K3 surface is the subgroup of the Weil-Ch\^atelet group of all twists that can be compactified to a K3 surface.</description>

      <title>Constructible Subcategories and Unbounded Representation Type (with an appendix by Andres Fernandez Herrero)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bounded type implies finite type for a constructible subcategory of the module category of a finitely generated algebra over a field, which is a variant of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture. A full subcategory is constructible if it consists of all modules that vanish on a finitely presented functor. Our approach makes use of the Ziegler spectrum of a ring and a connection, established in this work, with the scheme of finite dimensional modules. We also discuss a variant of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture in this setting. It is shown to be true under additional assumptions on the algebra, but wrong in general. Lastly, it is proven that exact structures and matrix reductions give rise to constructible subcategories. Based on this, a translation from matrix reductions to reductions of exact structures is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there are Stein manifolds that admit normal crossing divisor compactifications despite being neither affine nor quasi-projective. To achieve this, we study the contact boundaries of neighborhoods of symplectic normal crossing divisors via a contact-geometric analog of W. Neumann's plumbing calculus. In particular, we give conditions under which the neighborhood is determined by the contact structure on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Real Spectrum Compactifications of Universal Geometric Spaces over Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct universal geometric spaces over the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ of the character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SL}_n$, providing geometric interpretations of boundary points. For an algebraic set $Y(\mathbb{R})$ on which $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ acts by algebraic automorphisms (such as $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$ or an algebraic cover of the symmetric space of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$), the projection map $\Xi \times Y \rightarrow \Xi$ extends to a $\Gamma$-equivariant continuous surjection $(\Xi \times Y)^{\mathrm{RSp}} \rightarrow \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$. The fibers of this extended map are homeomorphic to the Archimedean spectrum of $Y(\mathbb{F})$ for some real closed field $\mathbb{F}$, which is a locally compact subset of $Y^{\mathrm{RSp}}$. The Archimedean spectrum is naturally homeomorphic to the real analytification, and we use this identification to compute the image of the fibers in their Berkovich analytification. For $Y=\mathbb{P}^1$, the image is a real subtree.</description>

      <title>Schur-Weyl Duality and Higher Abel-Jacobi Invariants for Tautological Cycles in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.05326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the Hodge theory of the moduli space of genus $g$ curves with $n$ marked points, establishing new connections between Schur-Weyl duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_{g}$ and higher Abel-Jacobi invariants. We develop a represe\\ ntation-theoretic framework that decomposes higher Abel-Jacobi invariants of tautological cycles in $C_{g}^{n}$ according to symplectic Lie algebra representations, leveraging the Leray filtration and motivic decompositions compatible with $\mathfrak{sp}_{2g}$-actions. Central to this work is the introduction of \textbf{higher Faber-Pandharipande cycles} $FP_n = \pi_1^{\times 2}(\Delta_{12}^n \cdot \psi_1)$ in $CH^{n+1}(C_g^2)$, a new family of tautological cycles generalizing classical constructions. We prove these cycles are non-torsion under optimal genus constraints: for families over $(n-1)$-dimensional bases, $FP_n$ is not rationally equivalent to zero when $g \geq 3n+1$. Furthermore, we determine the precise position of $FP_n$ in the Leray filtration of $C_g^2 \to M_g$, showing it lies in depth $n+1$ but no deeper, with explicit non-vanishing in $H^{n+1}(M_g, R^{n+1}f_*\mathbb{Q})$ on the $V_{(n+1,1)}$-isotypic component. This yields the first systematic link between Schur-Weyl duality and higher transcendental invariants, revealing that higher diagonals encode geometric phenomena invisible to standard tautological classes.</description>

      <title>Refinement of the Infinitesimal Variation of Hodge Structure: the case of canonical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth complex projective curve with canonical divisor $K_C$ very ample. We explore the relation between the cup-product $$ H^1 (\Theta_C ) \longrightarrow \HKC^{\ast} \otimes H^1 (\OO_C (K_C)) $$ where $\Theta_C =\OO_C (-K_C)$ is the holomorphic tangent bundle of $C$, and the geometry of the canonical embedding of $C$. The cup-product, following Griffiths, stratifies $\PP(H^1 (\Theta_C ))$ by the subvarieties $\Sigma_r$, according to the rank $r$ of $\xi \in H^1 (\Theta_C )$ viewed as the linear map $$ \xi:\HKC \longrightarrow H^1 (\OO_C (K_C)) $$ or, equivalently, by the dimension of the kernel of $\xi$ $$ W_{\xi}=ker(\xi). $$ The refinement consists of the filtration of $W^{\bullet}_{\xi} ([\phi])$ of $W_{\xi}$, varying with $[\phi] \in \PP(W_{\xi})$. This filtration has geometric meaning:
  1) it is related to special divisors on $C$,
  2) it `counts' certain rational normal curves in the canonical embedding of $C$. As an illustration, the results about the strata $\Sigma_0$ and $\Sigma_1$ are recovered and
  as corollaries one obtains the classical theorems of Max Noether on projective normality of the canonical embedding and Babbage-Enriques-Petri about the canonical curve being cut out by quadrics. The refinement brings out new aspects: quiver representations, Fano toric varieties with a distinguished anti-canonical divisor, dimer models. The quiver emerges from the construction and properties of the refinement; the Fano variety arises from the graph underlying the quiver and related to the Higgs structures. The graph underlying the refinement becomes an important part of the theory: it connects to topics such as the Topological Quantum field theory, moduli of elliptic curves with marked points, modular curves, higher categorical structures.</description>

      <title>A topological algorithm for the Fourier transform of Stokes data at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a topological description of the behaviour of Stokes matrices under the Fourier transform from infinity to infinity in a large number of cases of one level. This explicit, algorithmic statement is obtained by building on a recent result of T. Mochizuki about the Fourier transform of Stokes data of irregular connections on the Riemann sphere and by using the language of Stokes local systems due to P. Boalch. In particular, this induces explicit isomorphisms between wild character varieties, in a much larger range of examples than those for which such isomorphisms have previously been written down. We conjecture that these isomorphisms are compatible with the quasi-Hamiltonian structure on the wild character varieties.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic and birational properties of linear spaces on intersections of two quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rationality questions for Fano schemes of linear spaces on smooth complete intersections of two quadrics, especially over non-closed fields. Our approach is to study hyperbolic reductions of the pencil of quadrics associated to $X$. We prove that the Fano schemes $F_r(X)$ of $r$-planes are birational to symmetric powers of hyperbolic reductions, generalizing results of Reid and Colliot-Th\'el\`ene--Sansuc--Swinnerton-Dyer, and we give several applications to rationality properties of $F_r(X)$.
  For instance, we show that if $X$ contains an $(r+1)$-plane over a field $k$, then $F_r(X)$ is rational over $k$. When $X$ has odd dimension, we show a partial converse for rationality of the Fano schemes of second maximal linear spaces, generalizing results of Hassett--Tschinkel and Benoist--Wittenberg. When $X$ has even dimension, the analogous result does not hold, and we further investigate this situation over the real numbers. In particular, we prove a rationality criterion for the Fano schemes of second maximal linear spaces on these even-dimensional complete intersections over $\mathbb R$; this may be viewed as extending work of Hassett--Koll\'ar--Tschinkel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gushel-Mukai manifolds are specific families of $n$-dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard rank $1$ and index $n-2$ where $3\leq n \leq 6$. A Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is either ordinary, i.e. a hyperquadric section of a quintic Del Pezzo $(n+1)$-fold, or special, i.e. it admits a double cover over the quintic Del Pezzo $n$-fold branched along an ordinary Gushel-Mukai $(n-1)$-fold. In this paper, we prove that a general special Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is K-stable for every $3\leq n\leq 6$. Furthermore, we give a description of the first and last walls of the K-moduli of the pair $(M,cQ)$, where $M$ is the quintic Del Pezzo fourfold (or fivefold) and $Q$ is an ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefold (or fourfold). Besides, we compute $\delta$-invariants of quintic Del Pezzo fourfolds and fivefolds which were shown to be K-unstable by K. Fujita, and show that they admit K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Computing positive tropical varieties and lower bounds on the number of positive roots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two effective tools for computing the positive tropicalization of algebraic varieties. First, we outline conditions under which the initial ideal can be used to compute the positive tropicalization, offering a real analogue to the Fundamental Theorem of Tropical Geometry. Additionally, under certain technical assumptions, we provide a real version of the Transverse Intersection Theorem. Building on these results, we propose an algorithm to compute a combinatorial bound on the number of positive real roots of a parametrized polynomial equations system. Furthermore, we discuss how this combinatorial bound can be applied to study the number of positive steady states in chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Codimension one foliations on adjoint varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify codimension one foliations on adjoint varieties with most positive anti-canonical class. We show that on adjoint varieties with Picard number one, these foliations are always induced by a pencil of hyperplane sections with respect to their minimal embedding. For adjoint varieties of Picard number two, there is more than one component of such foliations, and we describe each of them. As a tool for understanding these foliations, we introduce the concept of the degree of a foliation with respect to a family of rational curves, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Hodge and V-filtrations of mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove a Beilinson-type formula for the V-filtration of Kashiwara and Malgrange on a complex mixed Hodge module, using Hodge filtrations on the localization.
  We give an application to the theory of higher multiplier and Hodge ideals. The main result is that the higher multiplier ideals can be deduced directly from the Hodge ideals by taking a suitable limit. As a corollary, we conclude that the Hodge ideals are left semi-continuous if and only if they coincide with the higher multiplier ideals.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of higher cohomology and cohomological rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work begins by studying the vanishing of higher cohomology for the derived pushforward of a torsion free sheaf along a modification of integral Noetherian schemes. Leveraging this, we establish a relatively simple recipe for constructing varieties with (mild) rational or Du Bois singularities, some of which is applicable in both zero and nonzero characteristic. Furthermore, we explore notions of singularities that lie in the same cohomological veins of rational singularities for varieties in characteristic zero, including Bhatt's derived splinters and Kov\'{a}cs' birational derived splinters.</description>

      <title>Variation of Tannaka groups of perverse sheaves in family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$, let $S$ be a smooth, geometrically connected variety over $k$, with generic point $\eta$, and $f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow S$ a morphism separated and of finite type. Fix a prime $\ell$. Let $\mathbb{P}$ be an $f$-universally locally acyclic relative perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf on $\mathbb{X}/S$. We prove that if for some (equivalently, every) geometric point $\bar \eta$ over $\eta$ the restriction $\mathbb{P}|_{\mathbb{X}_{\bar \eta}}$ is simple as a perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf on $\mathbb{X}_{\bar \eta}$, then there is a non-empty open subscheme $U\subset S$ such that, for every geometric point $\bar s$ on $U$, the restriction $\mathbb{P}|_{\mathbb{X}_{\bar s}}$ is simple as a perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf on $\mathbb{X}_{\bar s}$. When $f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow S$ is an abelian scheme, we give applications of this result to the variation with $s\in S$ of the Tannaka group of $\mathbb{P}|_{\mathbb{X}_{\bar s}}$.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of critical points on real algebraic sets and applications to optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F \in \R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ and the zero set $V=\zero(\mathcal{P},\R^n)$, where $\mathcal{P}:=\{P_1,\ldots,P_s\} \subset \R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ is a finite set of polynomials. We investigate existence of critical points of $F$ on an infinitesimal perturbation $V_{\xi} = \zero(\{P_1-\xi_1,\ldots,P_s-\xi_s\},\R^n)$. Our main motivation is to understand the limiting behavior of local minimizers of the log-barrier function (and central paths) in polynomial optimization, whose existence plays a fundamental role, in theory and practice, for modern interior point methods. We establish different sets of conditions that ensure existence, finiteness, boundedness, and non-degeneracy of critical points of $F$ on $V_{\xi}$, respectively. These lead to new conditions for the existence, convergence, and smoothness of central paths of polynomial optimization and its extension to non-linear optimization problems involving definable sets and functions in an o-minimal structure. In particular, for non-linear programs defined by real globally analytic functions, our extension provides a stronger form of the convergence result obtained by Drummond and Peterzil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the LNE property in complex analytic hypersurface parametrized germs, that is, the sets that are images of finite analytic map germs from $(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$. We prove that if the multiplicity of $f$ is equal to his generic degree, then the image of $f$ is LNE at 0 if and only if it is a smooth germ. We also show that every finite corank 1 map is sattisfies the previous hypothesis. Moreover, we show that for an injective map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$, the image of $f$ is LNE at 0 if and only if $f$ is an embedding.</description>

      <title>Hecke operators for curves over non-archimedean local fields and related finite rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hecke operators associated with curves over a non-archimedean local field $K$ and over the rings $O/{\mathfrak m}^N$, where $O\subset K$ is the ring of integers. Our main result is commutativity of a certain "small" local Hecke algebra over $O/{\mathfrak m}^N$, associated with a connected split reductive group $G$ such that $[G,G]$ is simple and simpy connected. The proof uses a Hecke algebra associated with $G(K(\!(t)\!))$ and a global argument involving $G$-bundles on curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider mutations of skew-symmetrizable matrices of rank 3. Every skew-symmetrizable matrix corresponds to a weighted quiver, and we study the conditions when this quiver is always cyclic after applying mutations. In this study, the Markov constant has an essential meaning. It has already appeared in some previous works for skew-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>On holographic duals of certain isolated weighted Gorenstein cDV singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Boundary stratifications of Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hurwitz space that parametrises holomorphic maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$. Abramovich, Corti and Vistoli, building on work of Harris and Mumford, describe a compactification $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$ with a natural boundary stratification. We show that the irreducible strata of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$ are in bijection with combinatorial objects called decorated trees (up to a suitable equivalence), and that containment of irreducible strata is given by edge contraction of decorated trees. This combinatorial description allows us to define a tropical Hurwitz space, which we identify with the skeleton of the Berkovich analytification of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$. The tropical Hurwitz space that we obtain is a refinement of a version defined by Cavalieri, Markwig and Ranganathan. We also provide an implementation that computes the stratification of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$, and discuss applications to complex dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>
