      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</description>

      <title>Batch Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Experimental Design: Simulation and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks. To elucidate BO behavior in noisy and high-dimensional settings typical for materials science applications, we perform batch BO of two six-dimensional test functions: an Ackley function representing a needle-in-a-haystack problem and a Hartmann function representing a problem with a false maximum with a value close to the global maximum. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the evolution of optimization in high dimensions and evaluate how they are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function,and its exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape; therefore, prior knowledge of the domain structure and noise level is needed when designing BO. The Ackley function optimization is significantly degraded by noise with a complete loss of ground truth resemblance when noise equals 10 % of the maximum objective value. For the Hartmann function, even in the absence of noise, a significant fraction of the initial samplings identify the false maximum instead of the ground truth maximum as the optimum of the function; with increasing noise, BO remains effective, albeit with increasing probability of landing on the false maximum. This study systematically highlights the critical issues when setting up BO and choosing synthetic data to test experimental design. The results and methodology will facilitate wider utilization of BO in guiding experiments, specifically in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Heterogeneous Causal Bayesian Networks for Seismic Multi-Hazard Estimation: A Variational Approach with Gaussian Processes and Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-earthquake hazard and impact estimation are critical for effective disaster response, yet current approaches face significant limitations. Traditional models employ fixed parameters regardless of geographical context, misrepresenting how seismic effects vary across diverse landscapes, while remote sensing technologies struggle to distinguish between co-located hazards. We address these challenges with a spatially-aware causal Bayesian network that decouples co-located hazards by modeling their causal relationships with location-specific parameters. Our framework integrates sensing observations, latent variables, and spatial heterogeneity through a novel combination of Gaussian Processes with normalizing flows, enabling us to capture how same earthquake produces different effects across varied geological and topographical features. Evaluations across three earthquakes demonstrate Spatial-VCBN achieves Area Under the Curve (AUC) improvements of up to 35.2% over existing methods. These results highlight the critical importance of modeling spatial heterogeneity in causal mechanisms for accurate disaster assessment, with direct implications for improving emergency response resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Computational Efficient Informative Nonignorable Matrix Completion: A Row- and Column-Wise Matrix U-Statistic Pseudo-Likelihood Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we establish a unified framework to deal with the high dimensional matrix completion problem under flexible nonignorable missing mechanisms. Although the matrix completion problem has attracted much attention over the years, there are very sparse works that consider the nonignorable missing mechanism. To address this problem, we derive a row- and column-wise matrix U-statistics type loss function, with the nuclear norm for regularization. A singular value proximal gradient algorithm is developed to solve the proposed optimization problem. We prove the non-asymptotic upper bound of the estimation error's Frobenius norm and show the performance of our method through numerical simulations and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Convergence of Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression via Large and Adaptive Stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\textit{gradient descent}$ (GD) for logistic regression on linearly separable data with stepsizes that adapt to the current risk, scaled by a constant hyperparameter $\eta$. We show that after at most $1/\gamma^2$ burn-in steps, GD achieves a risk upper bounded by $\exp(-\Theta(\eta))$, where $\gamma$ is the margin of the dataset. As $\eta$ can be arbitrarily large, GD attains an arbitrarily small risk $\textit{immediately after the burn-in steps}$, though the risk evolution may be $\textit{non-monotonic}$.
  We further construct hard datasets with margin $\gamma$, where any batch or online first-order method requires $\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ steps to find a linear separator. Thus, GD with large, adaptive stepsizes is $\textit{minimax optimal}$ among first-order batch methods. Notably, the classical $\textit{Perceptron}$ (Novikoff, 1962), a first-order online method, also achieves a step complexity of $1/\gamma^2$, matching GD even in constants.
  Finally, our GD analysis extends to a broad class of loss functions and certain two-layer networks.</description>

      <title>Randomised Postiterations for Calibrated BayesCG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian conjugate gradient method offers probabilistic solutions to linear systems but suffers from poor calibration, limiting its utility in uncertainty quantification tasks. Recent approaches leveraging postiterations to construct priors have improved computational properties but failed to correct calibration issues. In this work, we propose a novel randomised postiteration strategy that enhances the calibration of the BayesCG posterior while preserving its favourable convergence characteristics. We present theoretical guarantees for the improved calibration, supported by results on the distribution of posterior errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the method in both synthetic and inverse problem settings, showing enhanced uncertainty quantification and better propagation of uncertainties through computational pipelines.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bounds for Laplacian Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the performance of the estimation of Laplacian matrices under general observation models. Laplacian matrix estimation involves structural constraints, including symmetry and null-space properties, along with matrix sparsity. By exploiting a linear reparametrization that enforces the structural constraints, we derive closed-form matrix expressions for the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) specifically tailored to Laplacian matrix estimation. We further extend the derivation to the sparsity-constrained case, introducing two oracle CRBs that incorporate prior information of the support set, i.e. the locations of the nonzero entries in the Laplacian matrix. We examine the properties and order relations between the bounds, and provide the associated Slepian-Bangs formula for the Gaussian case. We demonstrate the use of the new CRBs in three representative applications: (i) topology identification in power systems, (ii) graph filter identification in diffused models, and (iii) precision matrix estimation in Gaussian Markov random fields under Laplacian constraints. The CRBs are evaluated and compared with the mean-squared-errors (MSEs) of the constrained maximum likelihood estimator (CMLE), which integrates both equality and inequality constraints along with sparsity constraints, and of the oracle CMLE, which knows the locations of the nonzero entries of the Laplacian matrix. We perform this analysis for the applications of power system topology identification and graphical LASSO, and demonstrate that the MSEs of the estimators converge to the CRB and oracle CRB, given a sufficient number of measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Approximate Algorithms for Optimal Transport Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, linear regression models incorporating an optimal transport (OT) loss have been explored for applications such as supervised unmixing of spectra, music transcription, and mass spectrometry. However, these task-specific approaches often do not generalize readily to a broader class of linear models. In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic framework for solving a general class of non-negative linear regression models with an entropy-regularized OT datafit term, based on Sinkhorn-like scaling iterations. Our framework accommodates convex penalty functions on the weights (e.g. squared-$\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ norms), and admits additional convex loss terms between the transported marginal and target distribution (e.g. squared error or total variation). We derive simple multiplicative updates for common penalty and datafit terms. This method is suitable for large-scale problems due to its simplicity of implementation and straightforward parallelization.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Personalized Federated Learning: Knowledge Distillation with Weighted Combination Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving framework for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without centralizing sensitive data. However, statistical heterogeneity, characterized by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) client data, poses significant challenges, leading to model drift and poor generalization. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, pFedKD-WCL (Personalized Federated Knowledge Distillation with Weighted Combination Loss), which integrates knowledge distillation with bi-level optimization to address non-IID challenges. pFedKD-WCL leverages the current global model as a teacher to guide local models, optimizing both global convergence and local personalization efficiently. We evaluate pFedKD-WCL on the MNIST dataset and a synthetic dataset with non-IID partitioning, using multinomial logistic regression and multilayer perceptron models. Experimental results demonstrate that pFedKD-WCL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, Per-FedAvg, and pFedMe, in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Interval-Valued Time Series Classification Using $D_K$-Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, modeling and analysis of interval-valued time series have garnered increasing attention in econometrics, finance, and statistics. However, these studies have predominantly focused on statistical inference in the forecasting of univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series, overlooking another important aspect: classification. In this paper, we introduce a classification approach that treats intervals as unified entities, applicable to both univariate and multivariate interval-valued time series. Specifically, we first extend the point-valued time series imaging methods to interval-valued scenarios using the $D_K$-distance, enabling the imaging of interval-valued time series. Then, we employ suitable deep learning model for classification on the obtained imaging dataset, aiming to achieve classification for interval-valued time series. In theory, we derived a sharper excess risk bound for deep multiclassifiers based on offset Rademacher complexity. Finally, we validate the superiority of the proposed method through comparisons with various existing point-valued time series classification methods in both simulation studies and real data applications.</description>

      <title>Sparse Optimization for Transfer Learning: A L0-Regularized Framework for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores transfer learning in heterogeneous multi-source environments with distributional divergence between target and auxiliary domains. To address challenges in statistical bias and computational efficiency, we propose a Sparse Optimization for Transfer Learning (SOTL) framework based on L0-regularization. The method extends the Joint Estimation Transferred from Strata (JETS) paradigm with two key innovations: (1) L0-constrained exact sparsity for parameter space compression and complexity reduction, and (2) refining optimization focus to emphasize target parameters over redundant ones. Simulations show that SOTL significantly improves both estimation accuracy and computational speed, especially under adversarial auxiliary domain conditions. Empirical validation on the Community and Crime benchmarks demonstrates the statistical robustness of the SOTL method in cross-domain transfer.</description>

      <title>SurvSurf: a partially monotonic neural network for first-hitting time prediction of intermittently observed discrete and continuous sequential events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural-network based survival model (SurvSurf) specifically designed for direct and simultaneous probabilistic prediction of the first hitting time of sequential events from baseline. Unlike existing models, SurvSurf is theoretically guaranteed to never violate the monotonic relationship between the cumulative incidence functions of sequential events, while allowing nonlinear influence from predictors. It also incorporates implicit truths for unobserved intermediate events in model fitting, and supports both discrete and continuous time and events. We also identified a variant of the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) that showed robust correlation with the mean squared error (MSE) between the true and predicted probabilities by accounting for implied truths about the missing intermediate events. We demonstrated the superiority of SurvSurf compared to modern and traditional predictive survival models in two simulated datasets and two real-world datasets, using MSE, the more robust IBS and by measuring the extent of monotonicity violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05004v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) is a sample-efficient method for approximate Bayesian inference with computationally expensive likelihoods. While VBMC's local surrogate approach provides stable approximations, its conservative exploration strategy and limited evaluation budget can cause it to miss regions of complex posteriors. In this work, we introduce Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (S-VBMC), a method that constructs global posterior approximations by merging independent VBMC runs through a principled and inexpensive post-processing step. Our approach leverages VBMC's mixture posterior representation and per-component evidence estimates, requiring no additional likelihood evaluations while being naturally parallelizable. We demonstrate S-VBMC's effectiveness on two synthetic problems designed to challenge VBMC's exploration capabilities and two real-world applications from computational neuroscience, showing substantial improvements in posterior approximation quality across all cases.</description>

      <title>DDPM Score Matching and Distribution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score estimation is the backbone of score-based generative models (SGMs), especially denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). A key result in this area shows that with accurate score estimates, SGMs can efficiently generate samples from any realistic data distribution (Chen et al., ICLR'23; Lee et al., ALT'23). This distribution learning result, where the learned distribution is implicitly that of the sampler's output, does not explain how score estimation relates to classical tasks of parameter and density estimation.
  This paper introduces a framework that reduces score estimation to these two tasks, with various implications for statistical and computational learning theory:
  Parameter Estimation: Koehler et al. (ICLR'23) demonstrate that a score-matching variant is statistically inefficient for the parametric estimation of multimodal densities common in practice. In contrast, we show that under mild conditions, denoising score-matching in DDPMs is asymptotically efficient.
  Density Estimation: By linking generation to score estimation, we lift existing score estimation guarantees to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC density estimation, i.e., a function approximating the target log-density within $\epsilon$ on all but a $\delta$-fraction of the space. We provide (i) minimax rates for density estimation over H\"older classes and (ii) a quasi-polynomial PAC density estimation algorithm for the classical Gaussian location mixture model, building on and addressing an open problem from Gatmiry et al. (arXiv'24).
  Lower Bounds for Score Estimation: Our framework offers the first principled method to prove computational lower bounds for score estimation across general distributions. As an application, we establish cryptographic lower bounds for score estimation in general Gaussian mixture models, conceptually recovering Song's (NeurIPS'24) result and advancing his key open problem.</description>

      <title>Breach in the Shield: Unveiling the Vulnerabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential to general artificial intelligence, exhibiting remarkable capabilities in task understanding and problem-solving. However, the real-world reliability of these models critically depends on their stability, which remains an underexplored area. Despite their widespread use, rigorous studies examining the stability of LLMs under various perturbations are still lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel stability measure for LLMs, inspired by statistical methods rooted in information geometry. Our measure possesses desirable invariance properties, making it well-suited for analyzing model sensitivity to both parameter and input perturbations. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on models ranging in size from 1.5B to 13B parameters. Our results demonstrate the utility of our measure in identifying salient parameters and detecting vulnerable regions in input images or critical dimensions in token embeddings. Furthermore, leveraging our stability framework, we enhance model robustness during model merging, leading to improved performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new benchmark dataset for functional data analysis (FDA) is presented, focusing on the reconstruction of eye movements from EEG data. The contribution is twofold: first, open challenges and evaluation metrics tailored to FDA applications are proposed. Second, functional neural networks are used to establish baseline results for the primary regression task of reconstructing eye movements from EEG signals. Baseline results are reported for the new dataset, based on consumer-grade hardware, and the EEGEyeNet dataset, based on research-grade hardware.</description>

      <title>Sample, Don't Search: Rethinking Test-Time Alignment for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing test-time computation has emerged as a promising direction for improving language model performance, particularly in scenarios where model finetuning is impractical or impossible due to computational constraints or private model weights. However, existing test-time search methods using a reward model (RM) often degrade in quality as compute scales, due to the over-optimization of what are inherently imperfect reward proxies. We introduce QAlign, a new test-time alignment approach. As we scale test-time compute, QAlign converges to sampling from the optimal aligned distribution for each individual prompt. By adopting recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo for text generation, our method enables better-aligned outputs without modifying the underlying model or even requiring logit access. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QAlign on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic) using a task-specific RM, showing consistent improvements over existing test-time compute methods like best-of-n and majority voting. Furthermore, when applied with more realistic RMs trained on the Tulu 3 preference dataset, QAlign outperforms direct preference optimization (DPO), best-of-n, majority voting, and weighted majority voting on a diverse range of datasets (GSM8K, MATH500, IFEval, MMLU-Redux, and TruthfulQA). A practical solution to aligning language models at test time using additional computation without degradation, our approach expands the limits of the capability that can be obtained from off-the-shelf language models without further training.</description>

      <title>Detection Limits and Statistical Separability of Tree Ring Watermarks in Rectified Flow-based Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-Ring Watermarking is a significant technique for authenticating AI-generated images. However, its effectiveness in rectified flow-based models remains unexplored, particularly given the inherent challenges of these models with noise latent inversion. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluated and compared the detection and separability of watermarks between SD 2.1 and FLUX.1-dev models. By analyzing various text guidance configurations and augmentation attacks, we demonstrate how inversion limitations affect both watermark recovery and the statistical separation between watermarked and unwatermarked images. Our findings provide valuable insights into the current limitations of Tree-Ring Watermarking in the current SOTA models and highlight the critical need for improved inversion methods to achieve reliable watermark detection and separability. The official implementation, dataset release and all experimental results are available at this \href{https://github.com/dsgiitr/flux-watermarking}{\textbf{link}}.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Variational Inference with Tuneable Stochastic Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the observation that stochastic variational inference (SVI) is a form of annealing and present a modified SVI approach -- applicable to both large and small datasets -- that allows the amount of annealing done by SVI to be tuned. We are motivated by the fact that, in SVI, the larger the batch size the more approximately Gaussian is the intrinsic noise, but the smaller its variance. This low variance reduces the amount of annealing which is needed to escape bad local optimal solutions. We propose a simple method for achieving both goals of having larger variance noise to escape bad local optimal solutions and more data information to obtain more accurate gradient directions. The idea is to set an actual batch size, which may be the size of the data set, and a smaller effective batch size that matches the larger level of variance at this smaller batch size. The result is an approximation to the maximum entropy stochastic gradient at this variance level. We theoretically motivate our approach for the framework of conjugate exponential family models and illustrate the method empirically on the probabilistic matrix factorization collaborative filter, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, and the Gaussian mixture model.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black-Box: Symbolic Regression with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While most modern machine learning methods offer speed and accuracy, few promise interpretability or explainability -- two key features necessary for highly sensitive industries, like medicine, finance, and engineering. Using eight datasets representative of one especially sensitive industry, nuclear power, this work compares a traditional feedforward neural network (FNN) to a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). We consider not only model performance and accuracy, but also interpretability through model architecture and explainability through a post-hoc SHAP analysis. In terms of accuracy, we find KANs and FNNs comparable across all datasets, when output dimensionality is limited. KANs, which transform into symbolic equations after training, yield perfectly interpretable models while FNNs remain black-boxes. Finally, using the post-hoc explainability results from Kernel SHAP, we find that KANs learn real, physical relations from experimental data, while FNNs simply produce statistically accurate results. Overall, this analysis finds KANs a promising alternative to traditional machine learning methods, particularly in applications requiring both accuracy and comprehensibility.</description>

      <title>Random Normed k-Means: A Paradigm-Shift in Clustering within Probabilistic Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches remain largely constrained by traditional distance metrics, limiting their effectiveness in handling random data. In this work, we introduce the first k-means variant in the literature that operates within a probabilistic metric space, replacing conventional distance measures with a well-defined distance distribution function. This pioneering approach enables more flexible and robust clustering in both deterministic and random datasets, establishing a new foundation for clustering in stochastic environments. By adopting a probabilistic perspective, our method not only introduces a fresh paradigm but also establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that is expected to serve as a key reference for future clustering research involving random data. Extensive experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets assess our model's effectiveness using widely recognized evaluation metrics, including Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Calinski Harabasz, the adjusted Rand index, and distortion. Comparative analyses against established methods such as k-means++, fuzzy c-means, and kernel probabilistic k-means demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed random normed k-means (RNKM) algorithm. Notably, RNKM exhibits a remarkable ability to identify nonlinearly separable structures, making it highly effective in complex clustering scenarios. These findings position RNKM as a groundbreaking advancement in clustering research, offering a powerful alternative to traditional techniques while addressing a long-standing gap in the literature. By bridging probabilistic metrics with clustering, this study provides a foundational reference for future developments and opens new avenues for advanced data analysis in dynamic, data-driven applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for controlling linear dynamical systems under adversarial disturbances and cost functions. Our algorithm achieves a running time that scales polylogarithmically with the inverse of the stability margin, improving upon prior methods with polynomial dependence maintaining the same regret guarantees. The technique, which may be of independent interest, is based on a novel convex relaxation that approximates linear control policies using spectral filters constructed from the eigenvectors of a specific Hankel matrix.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution Score-Based Variational Graphical Diffusion for Causal Disaster System Modeling and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems with intricate causal dependencies challenge accurate prediction. Effective modeling requires precise physical process representation, integration of interdependent factors, and incorporation of multi-resolution observational data. These systems manifest in both static scenarios with instantaneous causal chains and temporal scenarios with evolving dynamics, complicating modeling efforts. Current methods struggle to simultaneously handle varying resolutions, capture physical relationships, model causal dependencies, and incorporate temporal dynamics, especially with inconsistently sampled data from diverse sources. We introduce Temporal-SVGDM: Score-based Variational Graphical Diffusion Model for Multi-resolution observations. Our framework constructs individual SDEs for each variable at its native resolution, then couples these SDEs through a causal score mechanism where parent nodes inform child nodes' evolution. This enables unified modeling of both immediate causal effects in static scenarios and evolving dependencies in temporal scenarios. In temporal models, state representations are processed through a sequence prediction model to predict future states based on historical patterns and causal relationships. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and causal understanding compared to existing methods, with robust performance under varying levels of background knowledge. Our model exhibits graceful degradation across different disaster types, successfully handling both static earthquake scenarios and temporal hurricane and wildfire scenarios, while maintaining superior performance even with limited data.</description>

      <title>Memory-Statistics Tradeoff in Continual Learning with Structural Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical performance of a continual learning problem with two linear regression tasks in a well-specified random design setting. We consider a structural regularization algorithm that incorporates a generalized $\ell_2$-regularization tailored to the Hessian of the previous task for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We establish upper and lower bounds on the joint excess risk for this algorithm. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between memory complexity and statistical efficiency, where memory complexity is measured by the number of vectors needed to define the structural regularization. Specifically, increasing the number of vectors in structural regularization leads to a worse memory complexity but an improved excess risk, and vice versa. Furthermore, our theory suggests that naive continual learning without regularization suffers from catastrophic forgetting, while structural regularization mitigates this issue. Notably, structural regularization achieves comparable performance to joint training with access to both tasks simultaneously. These results highlight the critical role of curvature-aware regularization for continual learning.</description>

      <title>Scalable Robust Bayesian Co-Clustering with Compositional ELBOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-clustering exploits the duality of instances and features to simultaneously uncover meaningful groups in both dimensions, often outperforming traditional clustering in high-dimensional or sparse data settings. Although recent deep learning approaches successfully integrate feature learning and cluster assignment, they remain susceptible to noise and can suffer from posterior collapse within standard autoencoders. In this paper, we present the first fully variational Co-clustering framework that directly learns row and column clusters in the latent space, leveraging a doubly reparameterized ELBO to improve gradient signal-to-noise separation. Our unsupervised model integrates a Variational Deep Embedding with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) prior for both instances and features, providing a built-in clustering mechanism that naturally aligns latent modes with row and column clusters. Furthermore, our regularized end-to-end noise learning Compositional ELBO architecture jointly reconstructs the data while regularizing against noise through the KL divergence, thus gracefully handling corrupted or missing inputs in a single training pipeline. To counteract posterior collapse, we introduce a scale modification that increases the encoder's latent means only in the reconstruction pathway, preserving richer latent representations without inflating the KL term. Finally, a mutual information-based cross-loss ensures coherent co-clustering of rows and columns. Empirical results on diverse real-world datasets from multiple modalities, numerical, textual, and image-based, demonstrate that our method not only preserves the advantages of prior Co-clustering approaches but also exceeds them in accuracy and robustness, particularly in high-dimensional or noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Randomised Splitting Methods and Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an explicit link between stochastic gradient descent using common batching strategies and splitting methods for ordinary differential equations. From this perspective, we introduce a new minibatching strategy (called Symmetric Minibatching Strategy) for stochastic gradient optimisation which shows greatly reduced stochastic gradient bias (from $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ in the optimiser stepsize $h$), when combined with momentum-based optimisers. We justify why momentum is needed to obtain the improved performance using the theory of backward analysis for splitting integrators and provide a detailed analytic computation of the stochastic gradient bias on a simple example.
  Further, we provide improved convergence guarantees for this new minibatching strategy using Lyapunov techniques that show reduced stochastic gradient bias for a fixed stepsize (or learning rate) over the class of strongly-convex and smooth objective functions. Via the same techniques we also improve the known results for the Random Reshuffling strategy for stochastic gradient descent methods with momentum. We argue that this also leads to a faster convergence rate when considering a decreasing stepsize schedule. Both the reduced bias and efficacy of decreasing stepsizes are demonstrated numerically on several motivating examples.</description>

      <title>CATS: Mitigating Correlation Shift for Multivariate Time Series Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) leverages labeled source data to train models for unlabeled target data. Given the prevalence of multivariate time series (MTS) data across various domains, the UDA task for MTS classification has emerged as a critical challenge. However, for MTS data, correlations between variables often vary across domains, whereas most existing UDA works for MTS classification have overlooked this essential characteristic. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel domain shift, {\em correlation shift}, measuring domain differences in multivariate correlation. To mitigate correlation shift, we propose a scalable and parameter-efficient \underline{C}orrelation \underline{A}dapter for M\underline{TS} (CATS). Designed as a plug-and-play technique compatible with various Transformer variants, CATS employs temporal convolution to capture local temporal patterns and a graph attention module to model the changing multivariate correlation. The adapter reweights the target correlations to align the source correlations with a theoretically guaranteed precision. A correlation alignment loss is further proposed to mitigate correlation shift, bypassing the alignment challenge from the non-i.i.d. nature of MTS data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that (1) compared with vanilla Transformer-based models, CATS increases over $10\%$ average accuracy while only adding around $1\%$ parameters, and (2) all Transformer variants equipped with CATS either reach or surpass state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference Isn't Special: Why It's Just Another Prediction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference is often portrayed as fundamentally distinct from predictive modeling, with its own terminology, goals, and intellectual challenges. But at its core, causal inference is simply a structured instance of prediction under distribution shift. In both cases, we begin with labeled data from a source domain and seek to generalize to a target domain where outcomes are not observed. The key difference is that in causal inference, the labels -- potential outcomes -- are selectively observed based on treatment assignment, introducing bias that must be addressed through assumptions. This perspective reframes causal estimation as a familiar generalization problem and highlights how techniques from predictive modeling, such as reweighting and domain adaptation, apply directly to causal tasks. It also clarifies that causal assumptions are not uniquely strong -- they are simply more explicit. By viewing causal inference through the lens of prediction, we demystify its logic, connect it to familiar tools, and make it more accessible to practitioners and educators alike.</description>

      <title>Extending Cox Proportional Hazards Model with Symbolic Non-Linear Log-Risk Functions for Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model has been widely applied in survival analysis to estimate relative risks across different subjects given multiple covariates. Traditional CPH models rely on a linear combination of covariates weighted with coefficients as the log-risk function, which imposes a strong and restrictive assumption, limiting generalization. Recent deep learning methods enable non-linear log-risk functions. However, they often lack interpretability due to the end-to-end training mechanisms. The implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offers new possibilities for extending the CPH model with fully transparent and symbolic non-linear log-risk functions. In this paper, we introduce Generalized Cox Proportional Hazards (GCPH) model, a novel method for survival analysis that leverages KAN to enable a non-linear mapping from covariates to survival outcomes in a fully symbolic manner. GCPH maintains the interpretability of traditional CPH models while allowing for the estimation of non-linear log-risk functions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and various public benchmarks demonstrate that GCPH achieves competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits superior interpretability compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Novel Cholesky Kernel based Support Vector Classifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular supervised classification model that works by first finding the margin boundaries for the training data classes and then calculating the decision boundary, which is then used to classify the test data. This study demonstrates limitations of traditional support vector classification which uses cartesian coordinate geometry to find the margin and decision boundaries in an input space using only a few support vectors, without considering data variance and correlation. Subsequently, the study proposes a new Cholesky Kernel that adjusts for the effects of variance-covariance structure of the data in the decision boundary equation and margin calculations. The study demonstrates that SVM model is valid only in the Euclidean space, and the Cholesky kernel obtained by decomposing covariance matrix acts as a transformation matrix, which when applied on the original data transforms the data from the input space to the Euclidean space. The effectiveness of the Cholesky kernel based SVM classifier is demonstrated by classifying the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset and comparing with traditional SVM approaches. The Cholesky kernel based SVM model shows marked improvement in the precision, recall and F1 scores compared to linear and other kernel SVMs.</description>

      <title>A Consequentialist Critique of Binary Classification Evaluation Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ML-supported decisions, such as ordering tests or determining preventive custody, often involve binary classification based on probabilistic forecasts. Evaluation frameworks for such forecasts typically consider whether to prioritize independent-decision metrics (e.g., Accuracy) or top-K metrics (e.g., Precision@K), and whether to focus on fixed thresholds or threshold-agnostic measures like AUC-ROC. We highlight that a consequentialist perspective, long advocated by decision theorists, should naturally favor evaluations that support independent decisions using a mixture of thresholds given their prevalence, such as Brier scores and Log loss. However, our empirical analysis reveals a strong preference for top-K metrics or fixed thresholds in evaluations at major conferences like ICML, FAccT, and CHIL. To address this gap, we use this decision-theoretic framework to map evaluation metrics to their optimal use cases, along with a Python package, briertools, to promote the broader adoption of Brier scores. In doing so, we also uncover new theoretical connections, including a reconciliation between the Brier Score and Decision Curve Analysis, which clarifies and responds to a longstanding critique by (Assel, et al. 2017) regarding the clinical utility of proper scoring rules.</description>

      <title>Estimating Coverage in Streams via a Modified CVM Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When individuals in a population can be classified in classes or categories, the coverage of a sample, $C$, is defined as the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population belongs to a class represented in the sample. Estimating coverage is challenging because $C$ is not a fixed population parameter, but a property of the sample, and the task becomes more complex when the number of classes is unknown. Furthermore, this problem has not been addressed in scenarios where data arrive as a stream, under the constraint that only $n$ elements can be stored at a time. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method to estimate $C$ in streaming settings, based on a straightforward modification of the CVM algorithm, which is commonly used to estimate the number of distinct elements in a data stream.</description>

      <title>Better Rates for Random Task Orderings in Continual Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the common continual learning setup where an overparameterized model is sequentially fitted to a set of jointly realizable tasks. We analyze the forgetting, i.e., loss on previously seen tasks, after $k$ iterations. For linear models, we prove that fitting a task is equivalent to a single stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step on a modified objective. We develop novel last-iterate SGD upper bounds in the realizable least squares setup, and apply them to derive new results for continual learning. Focusing on random orderings over $T$ tasks, we establish universal forgetting rates, whereas existing rates depend on the problem dimensionality or complexity. Specifically, in continual regression with replacement, we improve the best existing rate from $O((d-r)/k)$ to $O(\min(k^{-1/4}, \sqrt{d-r}/k, \sqrt{Tr}/k))$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $r$ the average task rank. Furthermore, we establish the first rates for random task orderings without replacement. The obtained rate of $O(\min(T^{-1/4}, (d-r)/T))$ proves for the first time that randomization alone, with no task repetition, can prevent catastrophic forgetting in sufficiently long task sequences. Finally, we prove a similar $O(k^{-1/4})$ universal rate for the forgetting in continual linear classification on separable data. Our universal rates apply for broader projection methods, such as block Kaczmarz and POCS, illuminating their loss convergence under i.i.d and one-pass orderings.</description>

      <title>Topological Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two boundary distributions, the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem seeks the ``most likely`` random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this work, we propose the Topological Schr\"odinger Bridge problem (TSBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference process to follow some linear tractable topology-aware stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a closed-form topological SB (TSB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result, we show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological dynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop TSB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the unknowns in the optimal process as (topological) neural networks and learning them through likelihood training. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applications of TSB-based models on both synthetic and real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. Additionally, we discuss the connections of TSB-based models to other emerging models, and outline future directions for topological signal matching.</description>

      <title>Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safety in an Uncertain Environment: Constrained MDPs via Stochastic Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with constraints against stochastic thresholds, aiming at safety of reinforcement learning in unknown and uncertain environments. We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</description>

      <title>Unifying Physics- and Data-Driven Modeling via Novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for effective disease control and prevention. Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>PEAKS: Selecting Key Training Examples Incrementally via Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep learning continues to be driven by ever-larger datasets, understanding which examples are most important for generalization has become a critical question. While progress in data selection continues, emerging applications require studying this problem in dynamic contexts. To bridge this gap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples arrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the full data source. In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a training dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the underlying task. We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model state depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature space and its prediction error. Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS (Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection method tailored for IDS. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS consistently outperforms existing selection strategies. Furthermore, PEAKS yields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as training data size grows on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Convergence of Diffusion Models for Approximate Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are distinguished by their exceptional generative performance, particularly in producing high-quality samples through iterative denoising. While current theory suggests that the number of denoising steps required for accurate sample generation should scale linearly with data dimension, this does not reflect the practical efficiency of widely used algorithms like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions that can be well-approximated by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). For these distributions, our main result shows that DDPM takes at most $\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ iterations to attain an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution in total variation (TV) distance, independent of both the ambient dimension $d$ and the number of components $K$, up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, this result remains robust to score estimation errors. These findings highlight the remarkable effectiveness of diffusion models in high-dimensional settings given the universal approximation capability of GMMs, and provide theoretical insights into their practical success.</description>

      <title>Predicting Census Survey Response Rates With Parsimonious Additive Models and Structured Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.11328v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting survey response rates using a family of flexible and interpretable nonparametric models. The study is motivated by the US Census Bureau's well-known ROAM application, which uses a linear regression model trained on the US Census Planning Database data to identify hard-to-survey areas. A crowdsourcing competition (Erdman and Bates, 2016) organized more than ten years ago revealed that machine learning methods based on ensembles of regression trees led to the best performance in predicting survey response rates; however, the corresponding models could not be adopted for the intended application due to their black-box nature. We consider nonparametric additive models with a small number of main and pairwise interaction effects using $\ell_0$-based penalization. From a methodological viewpoint, we study our estimator's computational and statistical aspects and discuss variants incorporating strong hierarchical interactions. Our algorithms (open-sourced on GitHub) extend the computational frontiers of existing algorithms for sparse additive models to be able to handle datasets relevant to the application we consider. We discuss and interpret findings from our model on the US Census Planning Database. In addition to being useful from an interpretability standpoint, our models lead to predictions comparable to popular black-box machine learning methods based on gradient boosting and feedforward neural networks - suggesting that it is possible to have models that have the best of both worlds: good model accuracy and interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the most popular algorithms in statistical and machine learning due to its computational and memory efficiency. Various averaging schemes have been proposed to accelerate the convergence of SGD in different settings. In this paper, we explore a general averaging scheme for SGD. Specifically, we establish the asymptotic normality of a broad range of weighted averaged SGD solutions and provide asymptotically valid online inference approaches. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive averaging scheme that exhibits both optimal statistical rate and favorable non-asymptotic convergence, drawing insights from the optimal weight for the linear model in terms of non-asymptotic mean squared error (MSE).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy preservation has become a critical concern in high-dimensional data analysis due to the growing prevalence of data-driven applications. Since its proposal, sliced inverse regression has emerged as a widely utilized statistical technique to reduce the dimensionality of covariates while maintaining sufficient statistical information. In this paper, we propose optimally differentially private algorithms specifically designed to address privacy concerns in the context of sufficient dimension reduction. We establish lower bounds for differentially private sliced inverse regression in low and high dimensional settings. Moreover, we develop differentially private algorithms that achieve the minimax lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Through a combination of simulations and real data analysis, we illustrate the efficacy of these differentially private algorithms in safeguarding privacy while preserving vital information within the reduced dimension space. As a natural extension, we can readily offer analogous lower and upper bounds for differentially private sparse principal component analysis, a topic that may also be of potential interest to the statistics and machine learning community.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Differential Parameter Inference in Exponential Family using Time Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses differential inference in time-varying parametric probabilistic models, like graphical models with changing structures. Instead of estimating a high-dimensional model at each time point and estimating changes later, we directly learn the differential parameter, i.e., the time derivative of the parameter. The main idea is treating the time score function of an exponential family model as a linear model of the differential parameter for direct estimation. We use time score matching to estimate parameter derivatives. We prove the consistency of a regularized score matching objective and demonstrate the finite-sample normality of a debiased estimator in high-dimensional settings. Our methodology effectively infers differential structures in high-dimensional graphical models, verified on simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We address the problem of zero-order optimization from noisy observations for an objective function satisfying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz or the strong convexity condition. Additionally, we assume that the objective function has an additive structure and satisfies a higher-order smoothness property, characterized by the H\"older family of functions. The additive model for H\"older classes of functions is well-studied in the literature on nonparametric function estimation, where it is shown that such a model benefits from a substantial improvement of the estimation accuracy compared to the H\"older model without additive structure. We study this established framework in the context of gradient-free optimization. We propose a randomized gradient estimator that, when plugged into a gradient descent algorithm, allows one to achieve minimax optimal optimization error of the order $dT^{-(\beta-1)/\beta}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem, $T$ is the number of queries and $\beta\ge 2$ is the H\"older degree of smoothness. We conclude that, in contrast to nonparametric estimation problems, no substantial gain of accuracy can be achieved when using additive models in gradient-free optimization.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Extragradient Method for Nonsmooth and Low-Rank Matrix Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank and nonsmooth matrix optimization problems capture many fundamental tasks in statistics and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in recent years in developing efficient methods for \textit{smooth} low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been slow paced.
  In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems. Mainly, we prove that under a natural \textit{generalized strict complementarity} condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, the \textit{extragradient method}, when initialized with a ``warm-start'' point, converges to an optimal solution with rate $O(1/t)$ while requiring only two \textit{low-rank} SVDs per iteration. We give a precise trade-off between the rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating that using simple initializations, the extragradient method produces exactly the same iterates when full-rank SVDs are replaced with SVDs of rank that matches the rank of the (low-rank) ground-truth matrix to be recovered.</description>

      <title>Towards Super-polynomial Quantum Speedup of Equivariant Quantum Algorithms with SU($d$) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) [Quantum Inf. Comput., 10, 470-497 (2010)] -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential probability assignment in the Gaussian setting, where the goal is to predict, or equivalently compress, a sequence of real-valued observations almost as well as the best Gaussian distribution with mean constrained to a given subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. First, in the case of a convex constraint set $K$, we express the hardness of the prediction problem (the minimax regret) in terms of the intrinsic volumes of $K$; specifically, it equals the logarithm of the Wills functional from convex geometry. We then establish a comparison inequality for the Wills functional in the general nonconvex case, which underlines the metric nature of this quantity and generalizes the Slepian-Sudakov-Fernique comparison principle for the Gaussian width. Motivated by this inequality, we characterize the exact order of magnitude of the considered functional for a general nonconvex set, in terms of global covering numbers and local Gaussian widths. This implies sharp estimates, of metric nature, on the log-Laplace transform of the intrinsic volume sequence of a convex body. As part of our analysis, we also characterize the minimax redundancy for a general constraint set. We finally relate and contrast our findings with classical asymptotic results in information theory.</description>

      <title>From Alexnet to Transformers: Measuring the Non-linearity of Deep Neural Networks with Affine Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, we have witnessed the introduction of several novel deep neural network (DNN) architectures exhibiting ever-increasing performance across diverse tasks. Explaining the upward trend of their performance, however, remains difficult as different DNN architectures of comparable depth and width -- common factors associated with their expressive power -- may exhibit a drastically different performance even when trained on the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the non-linearity signature of DNN, the first theoretically sound solution for approximately measuring the non-linearity of deep neural networks. Built upon a score derived from closed-form optimal transport mappings, this signature provides a better understanding of the inner workings of a wide range of DNN architectures and learning paradigms, with a particular emphasis on the computer vision task. We provide extensive experimental results that highlight the practical usefulness of the proposed non-linearity signature and its potential for long-reaching implications.

      <title>Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</description>

      <title>Achieving ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ Complexity in Hessian/Jacobian-free Stochastic Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the bilevel optimization problem, in which the upper-level objective function is generally nonconvex and the lower-level objective function is strongly convex. Although this type of problem has been studied extensively, it still remains an open question how to achieve an ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ sample complexity in Hessian/Jacobian-free stochastic bilevel optimization without any second-order derivative computation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Hessian/Jacobian-free bilevel optimizer named FdeHBO, which features a simple fully single-loop structure, a projection-aided finite-difference Hessian/Jacobian-vector approximation, and momentum-based updates. Theoretically, we show that FdeHBO requires ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ iterations (each using ${O}(1)$ samples and only first-order gradient information) to find an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point. As far as we know, this is the first Hessian/Jacobian-free method with an ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ sample complexity for nonconvex-strongly-convex stochastic bilevel optimization.</description>

      <title>Fused Extended Two-Way Fixed Effects for Difference-in-Differences With Staggered Adoptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the bias of the canonical two-way fixed effects estimator for difference-in-differences under staggered adoptions, Wooldridge (2021) proposed the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, which adds many parameters. However, this reduces efficiency. Restricting some of these parameters to be equal (for example, subsequent treatment effects within a cohort) helps, but ad hoc restrictions may reintroduce bias. We propose a machine learning estimator with a single tuning parameter, fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE), that enables automatic data-driven selection of these restrictions. We prove that under an appropriate sparsity assumption FETWFE identifies the correct restrictions with probability tending to one, which improves efficiency. We also prove the consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality of FETWFE for several classes of heterogeneous marginal treatment effect estimators under either conditional or marginal parallel trends, and we prove the same results for conditional average treatment effects under conditional parallel trends. We provide an R package implementing fused extended two-way fixed effects, and we demonstrate FETWFE in simulation studies and an empirical application.</description>

      <title>On the best approximation by finite Gaussian mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a general Gaussian location mixture by finite mixtures. The minimum order of finite mixtures that achieve a prescribed accuracy (measured by various $f$-divergences) is determined within constant factors for the family of mixing distributions with compactly support or appropriate assumptions on the tail probability including subgaussian and subexponential. While the upper bound is achieved using the technique of local moment matching, the lower bound is established by relating the best approximation error to the low-rank approximation of certain trigonometric moment matrices, followed by a refined spectral analysis of their minimum eigenvalue. In the case of Gaussian mixing distributions, this result corrects a previous lower bound in [Allerton Conference 48 (2010) 620-628].</description>

      <title>A Causal Framework for Evaluating Deferring Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deferring systems extend supervised Machine Learning (ML) models with the possibility to defer predictions to human experts. However, evaluating the impact of a deferring strategy on system accuracy is still an overlooked area. This paper fills this gap by evaluating deferring systems through a causal lens. We link the potential outcomes framework for causal inference with deferring systems, which allows to identify the causal impact of the deferring strategy on predictive accuracy. We distinguish two scenarios. In the first one, we have access to both the human and ML model predictions for the deferred instances. Here, we can identify the individual causal effects for deferred instances and the aggregates of them. In the second one, only human predictions are available for the deferred instances. Here, we can resort to regression discontinuity designs to estimate a local causal effect. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real datasets for seven deferring systems from the literature.</description>

      <title>CONFINE: Conformal Prediction for Interpretable Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks exhibit remarkable performance, yet their black-box nature limits their utility in fields like healthcare where interpretability is crucial. Existing explainability approaches often sacrifice accuracy and lack quantifiable measures of prediction uncertainty. In this study, we introduce Conformal Prediction for Interpretable Neural Networks (CONFINE), a versatile framework that generates prediction sets with statistically robust uncertainty estimates instead of point predictions to enhance model transparency and reliability. CONFINE not only provides example-based explanations and confidence estimates for individual predictions but also boosts accuracy by up to 3.6%. We define a new metric, correct efficiency, to evaluate the fraction of prediction sets that contain precisely the correct label and show that CONFINE achieves correct efficiency of up to 3.3% higher than the original accuracy, matching or exceeding prior methods. CONFINE's marginal and class-conditional coverages attest to its validity across tasks spanning medical image classification to language understanding. Being adaptable to any pre-trained classifier, CONFINE marks a significant advance towards transparent and trustworthy deep learning applications in critical domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>AutoScale: Scale-Aware Data Mixing for Pre-Training LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training. Our code is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Oja's plasticity rule overcomes several challenges of training neural networks under biological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance through carefully engineered training strategies. Nonetheless, such methods lack parallels in biological neural circuits, relying heavily on non-local credit assignment, precise initialization, normalization layers, batch processing, and large datasets. Biologically plausible plasticity rules, such as random feedback alignment, often suffer from instability and unbounded weight growth without these engineered methods, while Hebbian-type schemes fail to provide goal-oriented credit. In this study, we demonstrate that incorporating Oja's plasticity rule into error-driven training yields stable, efficient learning in feedforward and recurrent architectures, obviating the need for carefully engineered tricks. Our results show that Oja's rule preserves richer activation subspaces, mitigates exploding or vanishing signals, and improves short-term memory in recurrent networks. Notably, meta-learned local plasticity rules incorporating Oja's principle not only match but surpass standard backpropagation in data-scarce regimes. These findings reveal a biologically grounded pathway bridging engineered deep networks and plausible synaptic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Biased Dueling Bandits with Stochastic Delayed Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dueling bandit problem, an essential variation of the traditional multi-armed bandit problem, has become significantly prominent recently due to its broad applications in online advertising, recommendation systems, information retrieval, and more. However, in many real-world applications, the feedback for actions is often subject to unavoidable delays and is not immediately available to the agent. This partially observable issue poses a significant challenge to existing dueling bandit literature, as it significantly affects how quickly and accurately the agent can update their policy on the fly. In this paper, we introduce and examine the biased dueling bandit problem with stochastic delayed feedback, revealing that this new practical problem will delve into a more realistic and intriguing scenario involving a preference bias between the selections. We present two algorithms designed to handle situations involving delay. Our first algorithm, requiring complete delay distribution information, achieves the optimal regret bound for the dueling bandit problem when there is no delay. The second algorithm is tailored for situations where the distribution is unknown, but only the expected value of delay is available. We provide a comprehensive regret analysis for the two proposed algorithms and then evaluate their empirical performance on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Targeted Cause Discovery with Data-Driven Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning approach for inferring causal variables of a target variable from observations. Our focus is on directly inferring a set of causal factors without requiring full causal graph reconstruction, which is computationally challenging in large-scale systems. The identified causal set consists of all potential regulators of the target variable under experimental settings, enabling efficient regulation when intervention costs and feasibility vary across variables. To achieve this, we train a neural network using supervised learning on simulated data to infer causality. By employing a local-inference strategy, our approach scales with linear complexity in the number of variables, efficiently scaling up to thousands of variables. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance in identifying causal relationships within large-scale gene regulatory networks, outperforming existing methods that emphasize full-graph discovery. We validate our model's generalization capability across out-of-distribution graph structures and generating mechanisms, including gene regulatory networks of E. coli and the human K562 cell line.

      <title>Embrace rejection: Kernel matrix approximation by accelerated randomly pivoted Cholesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) is an algorithm for constructing a low-rank approximation of a positive-semidefinite matrix using a small number of columns. This paper develops an accelerated version of RPCholesky that employs block matrix computations and rejection sampling to efficiently simulate the execution of the original algorithm. For the task of approximating a kernel matrix, the accelerated algorithm can run over $40\times$ faster. The paper contains implementation details, theoretical guarantees, experiments on benchmark data sets, and an application to computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>AutoStep: Locally adaptive involutive MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels can be formulated using a deterministic involutive proposal with a step size parameter. Selecting an appropriate step size is often a challenging task in practice; and for complex multiscale targets, there may not be one choice of step size that works well globally. In this work, we address this problem with a novel class of involutive MCMC methods -- AutoStep MCMC -- that selects an appropriate step size at each iteration adapted to the local geometry of the target distribution. We prove that AutoStep MCMC is $\pi$-invariant and has other desirable properties under mild assumptions on the target distribution $\pi$ and involutive proposal. Empirical results examine the effect of various step size selection design choices, and show that AutoStep MCMC is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of effective sample size per unit cost on a range of challenging target distributions.</description>

      <title>Can RLHF be More Efficient with Imperfect Reward Models? A Policy Coverage Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection method with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on summarization tasks.</description>

      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under heavy-tailed noise conditions, our SSQP method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds as in the light-tailed noise setting, while further exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Counterfactual Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study counterfactual regression, which aims to map input features to outcomes under hypothetical scenarios that differ from those observed in the data. This is particularly useful for decision-making when adapting to sudden shifts in treatment patterns is essential. We propose a doubly robust-style estimator for counterfactual regression within a generalizable framework that accommodates a broad class of risk functions and flexible constraints, drawing on tools from semiparametric theory and stochastic optimization. Our approach uses incremental interventions to enhance adaptability while maintaining consistency with standard methods. We formulate the target estimand as the optimal solution to a stochastic optimization problem and develop an efficient estimation strategy, where we can leverage rapid development of modern optimization algorithms. We go on to analyze the rates of convergence and characterize the asymptotic distributions. Our analysis shows that the proposed estimators can achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality for a broad class of problems. Numerical illustrations highlight their effectiveness in adapting to unseen counterfactual scenarios while maintaining parametric convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Weak instrumental variables due to nonlinearities in panel data: A Super Learner Control Function estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A triangular structural panel data model with additive separable individual-specific effects is used to model the causal effect of a covariate on an outcome variable when there are unobservable confounders with some of them time-invariant. In this setup, a linear reduced-form equation might be problematic when the conditional mean of the endogenous covariate and the instrumental variables is nonlinear. The reason is that ignoring the nonlinearity could lead to weak instruments As a solution, we propose a triangular simultaneous equation model for panel data with additive separable individual-specific fixed effects composed of a linear structural equation with a nonlinear reduced form equation. The parameter of interest is the structural parameter of the endogenous variable. The identification of this parameter is obtained under the assumption of available exclusion restrictions and using a control function approach. Estimating the parameter of interest is done using an estimator that we call Super Learner Control Function estimator (SLCFE). The estimation procedure is composed of two main steps and sample splitting. We estimate the control function using a super learner using sample splitting. In the following step, we use the estimated control function to control for endogeneity in the structural equation. Sample splitting is done across the individual dimension. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to test the performance of the estimators proposed. We conclude that the Super Learner Control Function Estimators significantly outperform Within 2SLS estimators.</description>
