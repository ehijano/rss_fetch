      <title>Phase retrieval on circles and lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb D$ such that $|f|=|g|$ on various sets $A$. We first prove that there exists $c$ in the unit circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in $\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$. The same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and $A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not. We also provide sequential versions of the previous results and analyse the case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally we examine the situation when there is equality on two distinct circles in the disc, proving a result or counterexample for each possible configuration.</description>

      <title>Linear Shafarevich Conjecture in positive characteristic, Hyperbolicity and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex quasi-projective normal variety $X$ and a linear representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_{N}(K)$ with $K$ any field of positive characteristic, we mainly establish the following results:
  1. the construction of the Shafarevich morphism ${\rm sh}_\varrho:X\to {\rm Sh}_\varrho(X)$ associated with $\varrho$.
  2. In cases where $X$ is projective, $\varrho$ is faithful and the $\Gamma$-dimension of $X$ is at most two (e.g. $\dim X=2$), we prove that the Shafarevich conjecture holds for $X$.
  3. In cases where $\varrho$ is big, we prove that the Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture holds for $X$.
  4. When $\varrho$ is big and the Zariski closure of $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is a semisimple algebraic group, we prove that $X$ is pseudo Picard hyperbolic, and strongly of log general type.
  5. If $X$ is special or $h$-special, then $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually abelian.
  We also prove Claudon-H\"oring-Koll\'ar's conjecture for complex projective manifolds with linear fundamental groups of any characteristic.</description>

      <title>$M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article intends to initiate an investigation into the structure of $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$, where $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ denotes the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ in $\mathbb{C}$. We introduce the notion of analytic primes and prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are analytic primes. From function Hilbert space perspective, we additionally prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are dense in the Hardy space. We show that outer functions play a key role in representing singly generated closed ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are $M$-ideals. This is also relevant to $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are finitely generated closed ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. We analyze $p$-sets of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ and their connection to the \v{S}ilov boundary of the maximal ideal space of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. Some of our results apply to the polydisc. In addition to addressing questions regarding $M$-ideals, the results presented in this paper offer some new perspectives on bounded analytic functions.</description>

      <title>Second main theorem and uniqueness problem of meromorphic functions with finite growth index sharing five small functions on a complex disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has twofold. The first is to establish a second main theorem for meromorphic functions on the complex disc $\Delta (R_0)\subset\mathbb C$ with finite growth index and small functions, where the counting functions are truncated to level $1$ and the small term is more detailed estimated. The second is to prove a generalization and improvement of the five values theorem of Nevanlinna for the case of five small functions on the complex disc $\Delta (R_0)$.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-extension indices, sharper estimates and curvature positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new concept of $L^2$-extension indices. This index is a function that gives the minimum constant with respect to the $L^2$-estimate of an Ohsawa--Takegoshi-type extension at each point. By using this notion, we propose a new way to study the positivity of curvature. We prove that there is an equivalence between how sharp the $L^2$-extension is and how positive the curvature is. New examples of sharper $L^2$-extensions are also systematically given. As applications, we use the $L^2$-extension index to study Pr\'ekopa-type theorems and to study the positivity of a certain direct image sheaf. We also provide new characterizations of pluriharmonicity and curvature flatness.</description>

      <title>Zero distribution of finite order Bank--Laine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that a Bank-Laine function $E$ is a product of two normalized solutions of the second order differential equation $f"+Af=0$ $(\dagger)$, where $A=A(z)$ is an entire function. By using Bergweiler and Eremenko's method of constructing transcendental entire function $A(z)$ by gluing certain meromorphic functions with infinitely many times, we show that, for each $\lambda\in[1,\infty)$ and each $\delta\in[0,1]$, there exists a Bank--Laine function $E$ such that $E=f_1f_2$ with $f_1$ and $f_2$ being two entire functions such that $\lambda(f_1)=\delta\lambda$ and $\lambda(f_2)=\lambda$, respectively. We actually provide a simpler construction of the special Bank--Laine functions given by Bergweiler and Eremenko.</description>

      <title>The Hartogs extension phenomenon and open embeddings, proper maps, compactifications, cohomologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use classical homological algebra methods to get results on the Hartogs extension phenomenon for holomorphic sections of holomorphic vector bundles over complex analytic varieties. Namely, we study behaviours of the Hartogs extension property with respect to the open embeddings, proper maps, compactifications, and relations with the compact supports first cohomology and with properties of boundaries of complex analytic varieties. As an application, we get a convex-geometric criterion of the Hartogs phenomenon for complex almost homogeneous algebraic $G$-varieties, where $G$ is a semiabelian variety.</description>

      <title>Non-hyperbolicity of holomorphic symplectic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-hyperbolicity of primitive symplectic varieties with $b_2 \geq 5$ that satisfy the rational SYZ conjecture. If in addition $b_2 \geq 7$, we establish that the Kobayashi pseudometric vanishes identically. This in particular applies to all currently known examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds and thereby completes the results by Kamenova--Lu--Verbitsky. The key new contribution is that a projective primitive symplectic variety with a Lagrangian fibration has vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric. The proof uses ergodicity, birational contractions, and cycle spaces.</description>

      <title>Cyclic nearly invariant subspaces for semigroups of isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the structure of the nearly invariant subspaces for discrete semigroups generated by several (even infinitely many) automorphisms of the unit disc is described. As part of this work, the near $S^*$-invariance property of the image space $C_\varphi({\rm ker\, } T)$ is explored for composition operators $C_\varphi$, induced by inner functions $\varphi$, and Toeplitz operators $T$. After that, the analysis of nearly invariant subspaces for strongly continuous multiplication semigroups of isometries is developed with a study of cyclic subspaces generated by a single Hardy class function. These are characterised in terms of model spaces in all cases when the outer factor is a product of an invertible function and a rational (not necessarily invertible) function. Techniques used include the theory of Toeplitz kernels and reproducing kernels.</description>

      <title>Fast ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface parameterization plays a fundamental role in many science and engineering problems. In particular, as genus-0 closed surfaces are topologically equivalent to a sphere, many spherical parameterization methods have been developed over the past few decades. However, in practice, mapping a genus-0 closed surface onto a sphere may result in a large distortion due to their geometric difference. In this work, we propose a new framework for computing ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterizations of genus-0 closed surfaces, in which the target parameter domain is an ellipsoid instead of a sphere. By combining simple conformal transformations with different types of quasi-conformal mappings, we can easily achieve a large variety of ellipsoidal parameterizations with their bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of locally symmetric rank one manifolds of infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss questions by Mostow \cite{Mo1}, Bers \cite{B} and Krushkal \cite{Kr1, Kr2} about uniqueness of a conformal or spherical CR structure on the sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ of symmetric rank one space $H_\mathbb{F}^n$ over division algebra $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}\,,\mathbb{C}\,,\mathbb{H}\,,\text{or}\,\, \mathbb{O} $ compatible with the action of a discrete group $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$. Introducing a nilpotent Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet with a positive Lebesgue measure in the nilpotent geometry in $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n\setminus\{\infty\}$ and its stretching, we construct a non-rigid discrete $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic groups $G\subset\operatorname{Isom}H_\mathbb{F}^n$ whose non-trivial deformations are induced by $G$-equivariant homeomorphisms of the space. Here we consider two situations: either the limit set $\Lambda(G)$ is the whole sphere at infinity $\partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ or restrictions of such non-trivial deformations to components of the discontinuity set $\Omega(G)\subset \partial H_\mathbb{F}^n$ are given by restrictions of $\mathbb{F}$-hyperbolic isometries. In both cases the demonstrated non-rigidity is related to non-ergodic dynamics of the discrete group action on the limit set which could be the whole sphere at infinity.</description>
