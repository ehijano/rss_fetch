      <title>Comparative prospects of imaging methods for whole-brain mammalian connectomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mammalian whole-brain connectomes are a crucial ingredient for holistic understanding of brain function. Imaging these connectomes at sufficient resolution to densely reconstruct cellular morphology and synapses represents a longstanding goal in neuroscience. Although the technologies needed to reconstruct whole-brain connectomes have not yet reached full maturity, they are advancing rapidly enough that the mouse brain might be within reach in the near future. Human connectomes remain a more distant goal. Here, we quantitatively compare existing and emerging imaging technologies that have potential to enable whole-brain mammalian connectomics. We perform calculations on electron microscopy (EM) techniques and expansion microscopy coupled with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (ExLSFM) methods. We consider techniques from the literature that have sufficiently high resolution to identify all synapses and sufficiently high speed to be relevant for whole mammalian brains. Each imaging modality comes with benefits and drawbacks, so we suggest that attacking the problem through multiple approaches could yield the best outcomes. We offer this analysis as a resource for those considering how to organize efforts towards imaging whole-brain mammalian connectomes.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Neural Interfaces: An Emerging Era in Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating smart algorithms on neural devices presents significant opportunities for various brain disorders. In this paper, we review the latest advancements in the development of three categories of intelligent neural prostheses featuring embedded signal processing on the implantable or wearable device. These include: 1) Neural interfaces for closed-loop symptom tracking and responsive stimulation; 2) Neural interfaces for emerging network-related conditions, such as psychiatric disorders; and 3) Intelligent BMI SoCs for movement recovery following paralysis.</description>

      <title>Towards auditory attention decoding with noise-tagging: A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude-modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.</description>
