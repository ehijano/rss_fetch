      <title>AgenticTCAD: A LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework for Automated TCAD Code Generation and Device Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Code: A Privacy-Preserving, Redundant Multi-Agent Framework for Reliable Local Clinical Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.</description>

      <title>DEFT: Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern IC complexity drives test pattern growth, with the majority of patterns targeting a small set of hard-to-detect (HTD) faults. This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults. These results indicate DEFT is a promising and effective ATPG engine, offering a valuable complement to existing heuristic.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-art Small Language Coder Model: Mify-Coder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Mify-Coder, a 2.5B-parameter code model trained on 4.2T tokens using a compute-optimal strategy built on the Mify-2.5B foundation model. Mify-Coder achieves comparable accuracy and safety while significantly outperforming much larger baseline models on standard coding and function-calling benchmarks, demonstrating that compact models can match frontier-grade models in code generation and agent-driven workflows. Our training pipeline combines high-quality curated sources with synthetic data generated through agentically designed prompts, refined iteratively using enterprise-grade evaluation datasets. LLM-based quality filtering further enhances data density, enabling frugal yet effective training. Through disciplined exploration of CPT-SFT objectives, data mixtures, and sampling dynamics, we deliver frontier-grade code intelligence within a single continuous training trajectory. Empirical evidence shows that principled data and compute discipline allow smaller models to achieve competitive accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance. Quantized variants of Mify-Coder enable deployment on standard desktop environments without requiring specialized hardware.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Discrimination Clusters: Quantifying and Explaining Systematic Fairness Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in algorithmic decision-making is often framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals receive similar outcomes. A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Test Case Specification Techniques and System Testing Tools in the Automotive Industry: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automotive domain is shifting to software-centric development to meet regulation, market pressure, and feature velocity. This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Mapping on Software Fairness: Focus, Trends and Industrial Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Fairness in systems has emerged as a critical concern in software engineering, garnering increasing attention as the field has advanced in recent years. While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.</description>

      <title>From Correctness to Collaboration: Toward a Human-Centered Framework for Evaluating AI Agent Behavior in Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from code generators into collaborative partners for software engineers, our methods for evaluation are lagging. Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.
  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.</description>

      <title>From Illusion to Insight: Change-Aware File-Level Software Defect Prediction Using Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction. The source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Coding With AI: From a Reflection on Industrial Practices to Future Computer Science and Software Engineering Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms in software development, including vibe coding, AI-assisted coding, and agentic coding, fundamentally reshaping how software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities.</description>

      <title>Developing controlled natural language for formal specification patterns using AI assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an AI assistant, we developed a method for systematically constructing controlled natural language for requirements based on formal specification patterns containing logical attributes. The method involves three stages: 1) compiling a generalized natural language requirement pattern that utilizes all attributes of the formal specification template; 2) generating, using the AI assistant, a corpus of natural language requirement patterns, reduced by partially evaluating attributes (the developed prompt utilizes the generalized template, attribute definitions, and specific formal semantics of the requirement patterns); and 3) formalizing the syntax of the controlled natural language based on an analysis of the grammatical structure of the resulting patterns. The method has been tested for event-driven temporal requirements.</description>

      <title>CoHalLo: code hallucination localization via probing hidden layer vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localization of code hallucinations aims to identify specific lines of code containing hallucinations, helping developers to improve the reliability of AI-generated code more efficiently. Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>"Game Changer" or "Overenthusiastic Drunk Acquaintance"? Generative AI Use by Blind and Low Vision Software Professionals in the Workplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software development workplace poses numerous technical and collaborative accessibility challenges for blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs). Though Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly adopted within the software development industry and has been a rapidly growing topic of interest in research, to date, the unique perspectives of BLVSPs have yet to be consulted. We report on a qualitative study involving 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs about what the introduction of GenAI has meant for their work. We found that BLVSPs used GenAI for many software development tasks, resulting in benefits such as increased productivity and accessibility. However, significant costs were also accompanied by GenAI use as they were more vulnerable to hallucinations than their sighted colleagues. Sometimes, organizational policies prevented use. Based on our findings, we discuss the higher-risks and higher-returns that BLVSPs had to carefully weigh when deciding whether and when to use GenAI tools for work.</description>

      <title>A Magnified View into Heterogeneous-ISA Thread Migration Performance without State Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</description>

      <title>Localized Calibrated Uncertainty in Code Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can generate complicated source code from natural language prompts. However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Training Data Optimization for LLM-based Code Generation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.</description>

      <title>A Tale of 1001 LoC: Potential Runtime Error-Guided Specification Synthesis for Verifying Large-Scale Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.</description>

      <title>How Do Agentic AI Systems Address Performance Optimizations? A BERTopic-Based Analysis of Pull Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase. Our findings provide empirical evidence that can support the evaluation and improvement of agentic AI systems with respect to their performance optimization behaviors and review outcomes.</description>

      <title>DynaFix: Iterative Automated Program Repair Driven by Execution-Level Dynamic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.
  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.</description>

      <title>How Do Agentic AI Systems Deal With Software Energy Concerns? A Pull Request-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts. However, optimization-related PRs are accepted less frequently than others, largely due to their negative impact on maintainability.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Bugs and Quality Attributes in Quantum Software: A Large-Scale Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</description>

      <title>Feature Slice Matching for Precise Bug Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.</description>

      <title>Securing High-Concurrency Ticket Sales: A Framework Based on Microservice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Embedding Representations for Financial News Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Deep Learning Model Fixing Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>SourceBroken: A large-scale analysis on the (un)reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SourceRank is a scoring system made of 18 metrics that assess the popularity and quality of open-source packages. Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.
  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.
  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.</description>

      <title>SoK: Web3 RegTech for Cryptocurrency VASP AML/CFT Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decentralized architecture of Web3 technologies creates fundamental challenges for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism compliance. Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities.
  We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems.
  Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Role of ChatGPT in Software Development: Insights from Developer-ChatGPT Interactions on GitHub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm in Software Engineering (SE), with generative AI tools like ChatGPT gaining widespread adoption among developers. While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, empirical evidence about how developers actually use LLMs' assistance in real-world practices remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT usage on GitHub, and we presented DevChat, a curated dataset of 2,547 publicly shared ChatGPT conversation links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Through comprehensively analyzing DevChat, we explored the characteristics of developer-ChatGPT interaction patterns and identified five key categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we investigated the dominant development-related activities in which ChatGPT is used, and presented a mapping framework that links GitHub data sources, development-related activities, and SE tasks. The findings show that interactions are typically short and task-focused (most are 1-3 turns); developers share conversations mainly to delegate tasks, resolve problems, and acquire knowledge, revealing five purpose categories; ChatGPT is most frequently engaged for Software Implementation and Maintenance &amp; Evolution; we identified 39 fine-grained SE tasks supported by ChatGPT, with Code Generation &amp; Completion as well as Code modification &amp; Optimization being the most prominent. Our study offers a comprehensive mapping of ChatGPT's applications in real-world software development scenarios and provides a foundation for understanding LLMs' practical roles in software development.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: Artifact Generation Through Layered Constraints and LLM x MDE Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ATLAS unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and compliance-critical domains. ATLAS integrates three pillars: a Unified Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) extends our prior Dual-Stage(S2D2) extraction logic to compile layered requirements into deterministic generation-time automata (Layer~1) and post-generation validators (Layer~2); and Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer enforcement -- Layer~1 structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while Layer~2 semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When violations occur, ATLAS performs audit-guided repair and records generation traces for compliance review. We evaluate ATLAS in automotive software engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels~I~bis). ATLAS produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, validating a graduated automation paradigm that automates routine construction while empowering experts to resolve complex semantic ambiguities through machine-checkable evidence.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs for Fine-Grained Code Review with Enriched Context in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code review is a cornerstone of software quality assurance, and recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in its automation. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review. We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries. ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: hunk-level quality assessment, line-level defect localization, and line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability. Deployed at ByteDance, ContextCRBench drives a self-evolving code review system, improving performance by 61.98% and demonstrating its robustness and industrial utility. https://github.com/kinesiatricssxilm14/ContextCRBench.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Unit Test Generation: Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated unit test generation is critical for software quality but traditional structure-driven methods often lack the semantic understanding required to produce realistic inputs and oracles. Large language models (LLMs) address this limitation by leveraging their extensive data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that divides the process into a generative phase for creating test artifacts and a quality assurance phase for refining them. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization approach and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability by significantly improving compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities and the lack of standardized benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression toward autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools.</description>

      <title>Building Software by Rolling the Dice: A Qualitative Study of Vibe Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping software engineering by enabling "vibe coding," in which developers build software primarily through prompts rather than writing code. Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices. To shed light on this emerging phenomenon, we conducted a grounded theory study of 20 vibe-coding videos, including 7 live-streamed coding sessions (about 16 hours, 254 prompts) and 13 opinion videos (about 5 hours), supported by additional analysis of activity durations and prompt intents. Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as "rolling the dice." Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust. These findings open new directions for research on the future of software engineering and point to practical opportunities for tool design and education.</description>

      <title>SoundnessBench: A Soundness Benchmark for Neural Network Verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) verification aims to formally verify properties of NNs, which is crucial for ensuring the behavior of NN-based models in safety-critical applications. In recent years, the community has developed many NN verifiers and benchmarks to evaluate them. However, existing benchmarks typically lack ground-truth for hard instances where no current verifier can verify the property and no counterexample can be found. This makes it difficult to validate the soundness of a verifier, when it claims verification on such challenging instances that no other verifier can handle. In this work, we develop a new benchmark for NN verification, named SoundnessBench, specifically for testing the soundness of NN verifiers. SoundnessBench consists of instances with deliberately inserted counterexamples that are hidden from adversarial attacks commonly used to find counterexamples. Thereby, it can identify false verification claims when hidden counterexamples are known to exist. We design a training method to produce NNs with hidden counterexamples and systematically construct our SoundnessBench with instances across various model architectures, activation functions, and input data. We demonstrate that our training effectively produces hidden counterexamples and our SoundnessBench successfully identifies bugs in state-of-the-art NN verifiers. Our code is available at https://github.com/mvp-harry/SoundnessBench and our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoundnessBench/SoundnessBench.</description>

      <title>LogosQ: A High-Performance and Type-Safe Quantum Computing Library in Rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.</description>
