      <title>Representation-protected topology of spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spin-singlet $s$-wave multi-band superconductors have a topological phase protected by rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry without spin-orbit coupling in two and three dimensions. This topological phase, an example of a representation-protected topological phase, has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index and is stable as long as the bands at the Fermi energy are formed by a doublet of orbital states with finite angular momenta. In the limit of weak superconducting pair potential, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index gives a Fermi-surface formula and is related to the winding number of three-dimensional strong topological superconductors of class CI. We present a model of a topological $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductor that has gapless surface states with a quadratic dispersion and suggest a connection with iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Holstein polarons, Rashba-like spin splitting and Ising superconductivity in electron-doped MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction between electrons and phonons in solids is a key effect defining physical properties of materials such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) the electron-phonon coupling results in the creation of polarons, quasiparticles that manifest themselves as discrete features in the electronic spectral function. In this study, we report the formation of polarons at the alkali dosed MoSe2 surface, where Rashba-like spin splitting of the conduction band states is caused by an inversion-symmetry breaking electric field. In addition, we observe the crossover from phonon-like to plasmon-like polaronic spectral features at MoSe2 surface with increasing doping. Our findings support the concept of electron-phonon coupling mediated superconductivity in electron-doped layered TMDC materials, observed using ionic liquid gating technology. Furthermore, the discovered spin-splitting at the Fermi level could offer crucial experimental validation for theoretical models of Ising-type superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of high-temperature superconductivity research is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability of other condensed matter phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect under time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In noncentrosymmetric superconductors, superconducting and normal conductions can interchange based on the current flow direction. This effect is termed a superconducting diode effect (SDE), which is a focal point of recent research. The broken inversion and time reversal symmetry is believed to be the requirements of SDE but their intrinsic role has remained elusive. Here, we report strain-controlled SDEs in a layered trigonal superconductor, PbTaSe2. The SDE was found exclusively in a strained device with its absence in an unstrained device, despite that it is allowed in unstrained trigonal structure. Moreover, the zero-field or magnetic field-even (magnetic field-odd) SDE is observed when the strain and current are along armchair (zigzag) direction The results unambiguously demonstrate the intrinsic SDE under time-reversal symmetry and the critical role of strain-induced electric polarization.</description>

      <title>Protected gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect was predicted to transform the surface state of a topological insulator (TI) into a topological superconductor, forming a nonchiral 1D Majorana state within a linear Josephson junction on the TI surface. The hallmark of this 1D Majorana state is a robust gap closing as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction, which alternates in and out of the topological phase. These topological phase-transitions occur at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ with integer $n$, leading to a $4\pi$-periodicity of the ground state. While the $4\pi$-periodicity has been indirectly inferred in the AC Josephson effect, the direct observation of the 1D Majorana state in a TI Josephson junction has remained contentious. Here, we report the direct observation of topological phase-transitions in a TI Josephson junction, where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. The observed transitions are independent of the chemical potential, reinforcing their topological origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our findings provide direct confirmation of the Fu-Kane proposal and robust evidence for the emergence of topological superconductivity in a TI Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Strange metal and superconductor in the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon $et$ $al$. (Nat. Comm. $\bf{14}$, 3033 (2023)). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Massive 1D Dirac Line, Solitons and Reversible Manipulation on the Surface of a Prototype Obstructed Atomic Insulator, Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators can be classified into atomic insulators (AIs) and obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) depending on whether the Wannier charge centers are localized or not at spatial positions occupied by atoms. An OAI can possess unusual properties such as surface states along certain crystalline surfaces, which advantageously appear in materials with much larger bulk energy gap than topological insulators, making them more attractive for potential applications. In this work, we show that a well-known crystal, silicon (Si) is a model OAI, which naturally explains some of Si's unusual properties such as its famous (111) surface states. On this surface, using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we reveal sharp quasi-1D massive Dirac line dispersions; we also observe, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), topological solitons at the interface of the two atomic chains. Remarkably, we show that the different chain domains can be reversibly switched at the nanometer scale, suggesting the application potential in ultra-high density storage devices.</description>

      <title>dx2-y2-wave Bose Metal induced by the next-nearest-neighbor hopping t'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity arises when electrons form Cooper pairs with phase coherence. In contrast, a lack of phase coherence in Cooper pairs can lead to an uncondensed metallic ground state known as the Bose metal state. In this study, we investigate an attractively interacting fermionic system with nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping (t) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping (t') anisotropy between two species of spins in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. Utilizing the constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we demonstrate the existence of a dx2-y2-wave Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) phase with t'/t &gt; 0.7. The CPBM phase exhibits a dome-like structure in the phase diagram of filling n~0.65, with the maximal region around an optimal t'/t ~ 0.2, suggesting that an appropriate value of t' facilitates the formation of the Bose metal. Furthermore, we find that a Bose metal formed by fermions with a closed Fermi surface confirms that the crucial condition for this exotic phenomenon is primarily the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, rather than its topology. Our finding of the dx2-y2-wave CPBM demonstrates the same pairing symmetry as the pseudogap behavior in cuprates, and its experimental realization in ultracold atom systems is also feasible.</description>

      <title>Emergent spinon-holon Feshbach resonance in a doped Majumdar-Ghosh model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>When Superconductivity Crosses Over: From BCS to BEC</title>

Abstract: New developments in superconductivity, particularly through unexpected and often astonishing forms of superconducting materials, continue to excite the community and stimulate theory. It is now becoming clear that there are two distinct platforms for superconductivity: natural and synthetic materials. The study of these artificial materials has greatly expanded in the last decade or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. Natural superconductors continue to surprise through the Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and nickelates as well as others. It is the goal of this review to present this two-pronged investigation into superconductors, with a focus on those that we have come to understand belong somewhere between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regimes. We characterize in detail the nature of this "crossover" superconductivity, which is to be distinguished from crossover superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases. In the process, we address the multiple ways of promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime within the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial superconducting films. This work should be viewed as a celebration of BCS theory by showing that even though this theory was initially implemented with the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can in a very natural way be extended to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nematicity and Orbital Depairing in Superconducting Bernal Bilayer Graphene with Strong Spin Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is a ubiquitous feature of graphite allotropes, having been observed in Bernal bilayers[1], rhombohedral trilayers[2], and a wide variety of angle-misaligned multilayers[3-6]. Despite significant differences in the electronic structure across these systems, supporting the graphite layer on a WSe$_2$ substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of SC in carrier density and temperature[7-10]. Here, we report the observation of two distinct superconducting states (denoted SC$_1$ and SC$_2$) in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. Quantum oscillations show that while the normal state of SC$_1$ is consistent with the single-particle band structure, SC$_2$ emerges from a nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are robust to in-plane magnetic fields, violating the paramagnetic limit; however, neither reach fields expected for spin-valley locked Ising superconductors. We use our knowledge of the Fermi surface geometry of SC$_1$ to argue that superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing arising from the imperfect layer polarization of the electron wavefunctions. Finally, a comparative analysis of transport and thermodynamic compressibility measurements in SC$_2$ shows that the proximity to the observed isospin phase boundaries, observed in other rhombohedral graphene allotropes, is likely coincidental, constraining theories of unconventional superconducting pairing mechanisms in theses systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Superconductivity and Superionicity in Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superconductivity in the superionic phase of the clathrate hydride Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$, where hydrogen ions diffuse among the lattice formed by lithium and magnesium ions. By employing the stochastic path-integral approach, we non-perturbatively take into account the effects of quantum diffusion and anharmonic vibrations. Our calculations reveal strong electron-ion coupling ($\lambda(0)$ = 3.7) and a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 277 K under 260 GPa, at which the material is still superionic. $T_c$ is significantly suppressed compared with the result $T_c$ = 473 K obtained from the conventional approach based on the harmonic approximation. Our study, based on a first-principles approach applicable to superionic systems, indicates that the superconductivity and superionicity can coexist in Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) modifies electron-electron interaction vertex giving rise to a spectrum of novel phenomena. First, the spin-orbit-modified Coulomb interactions induce $p$-wave superconducting order, without any need for other mediators of attraction. Remarkably, two distinct superconducting phases arise in 3D systems, mirroring the $\mathrm{A}$ or $\mathrm{B}$ phases of $^3\mathrm{He}$, depending on the sign of the SOI constant. In contrast, 2D systems exhibit $p^x\pm i p^y$ order parameter, leading to time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity. Second, a sufficiently strong RSOI induces ferromagnetic ordering. It is associated with a deformation of the Fermi surface, which may lead to a Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface, with a number of experimentally observable signatures. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, ferromagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity may coexist. This state resembles the $\mathrm{A}_1$ phase of $^3\mathrm{He}$, yet it may avoid nodal points due to the toroidal shape of the Fermi surface.</description>

Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional pairing interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>

Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>
