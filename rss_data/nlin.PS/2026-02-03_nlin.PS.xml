      <title>Nonreciprocity Induced Fractional Nonlinear Thouless Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest has surged in eigenvalue's nonlinearity-based topological transport governed by the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues $H\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$ [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024); C. Bai and Z. Liang, 111, 042201 (2025); Phys. Rev. A 112, 052207 (2025)] rather than the conventional Schrodinger equation $H\Psi=E\Psi$ in conservative settings, yet non-Hermitian generalizations remain uncharted. In this work, we are motivated to investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping in a non-Hermitian and nonlinear Rice-Mele model. In particular, we uncover how non-Hermiticity parameters can induce fractional topological phases--even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the framework of the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in the real world.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Dissipative Nonlinear Systems: A Study via 2D CGLE by Contact Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04526v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a contact-geometric framework for dissipative nonlinear field theories by extending the least constraint theorem to complex fields and establishing a rigorous link with probability measures. The Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation serves as a paradigmatic example, yielding a dissipative Contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation that governs the evolution of the action functional. Through canonical transformation and travelling-wave reduction, exact Jacobi elliptic solutions are obtained, revealing a continuous transition from periodic periodons to localised solitons. Probabilistic analysis identifies a universal switching line separating dynamical regimes and uncovers a first-order periodon-soliton phase transition with a hysteresis loop. The conserved contact potential emerges as the key geometric quantity governing pattern formation in dissipative media, analogous to energy in conservative systems.</description>

      <title>Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00308v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</description>

      <title>When higher-order interactions enhance synchronization: the case of the Kuramoto model on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.</description>
