      <title>BioLM-Score: Language-Prior Conditioned Probabilistic Geometric Potentials for Protein-Ligand Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18476</link>

Abstract: Protein-ligand scoring is a central component of structure-based drug design, underpinning molecular docking, virtual screening, and pose optimization. Conventional physics-based energy functions are often computationally expensive, limiting their utility in large-scale screening. In contrast, deep learning-based scoring models offer improved computational efficiency but frequently suffer from limited cross-target generalization and poor interpretability, which restrict their practical applicability. Here we present BioLM-Score, a simple yet generalizable protein-ligand scoring model that couples geometric modeling with representation learning. Specifically, it employs modality-specific and structure-aware encoders for proteins and ligands, each augmented with biomolecular language models to enrich structural and chemical representations. Subsequently, these representations are integrated through a mixture density network to predict multimodal interatomic distance distributions, from which statistically grounded likelihood-based scores are derived. Evaluations on the CASF-2016 benchmark demonstrate that BioLM-Score achieves significant improvements across docking, scoring, ranking, and screening tasks. Moreover, the proposed scoring function serves as an effective optimization objective for guiding docking protocols and conformational search. In summary, BioLM-Score provides a principled and practical alternative to existing scoring functions, combining efficiency, generalization, and interpretability for structure-based drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing life from non-life via molecular frontier orbital energy gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18490</link>

Abstract: Amino acids (AAs) are a key target in the search for life beyond Earth due to their extensive role in the machinery of all known life, persistence over geologic timescales, and analytical detectability. However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves &gt;95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Physical principles of building protein megacomplexes in a crowded milieu</title>

Abstract: Multiple phenotypic protein expressions arising from one genome represent variations in the protein relative abundance and their stoichiometry. A lack of definite compositional parts challenges the modeling of protein megacomplexes and cellular architectures. Despite the advances in protein structural predictions with AI, the mechanism of protein interactions and the emergence of megacomplexes they assemble remains unclear. Here, we present a statistical physics framework of grand canonical ensemble to explore the protein interactions that drive the emergent assembly of a megacomplex using the observational mass spectrometry datasets including protein relative abundance and the cross linked connections. Using chromatin remodeler megacomplex, INO80, as an example, we discovered a class of divergent protein that plays a critical role in orchestrating the assembly beyond nearest neighbors, dependent on the excluded volumes exerted by others. With the constraints of the excluded volumes by varying crowding contents, these divergent subunits orchestrate and form clusters with selective components growing into configurationally distinct architectures. We propose a machinery view for the INO80 chromatin remodeler complex where each loosely associated subunits can be occasionally recruited for parts as attachment into a core assembly driven by excluded volumes. Our computational framework provides a mechanistic insight into taking the macromolecular crowding as necessary physicochemical variables representing cell states to remodel the configurations of protein megacomplexes with structurally loose modules.</description>

      <title>Piecewise integrability of the discrete Hasimoto map for analytic prediction and design of helical peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions, helical peptides can be modeled as piecewise integrable systems where the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic mapping $(\phi,\psi) \rightarrow (\kappa,\tau)$ between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for 50 helical peptide chains. This transformation is globally information-preserving but ill-conditioned within the helical basin (median Jacobian condition number 31), suggesting chiral information loss arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. Using a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation, we show deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity, while curvature remains rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy (median RMSD 0.77\,\AA), enabling a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects and trims non-integrable terminal fraying. Evaluating only these integrable islands, the dispersion relation extracts high-accuracy structural cores for 88\% of the dataset. Inverse backbone design is feasible within a defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to controlling torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability.</description>
