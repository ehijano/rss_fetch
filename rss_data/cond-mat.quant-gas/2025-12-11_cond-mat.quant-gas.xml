      <title>Swimming against a superfluid flow: Self-propulsion via vortex-antivortex shedding in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Thermal liquid-gas phase transition in a quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate thermodynamic properties in a quasi-one-dimensional single-component dipolar Fermi gas at finite temperatures. The self-bound fermionic droplet can be achieved by exchange correlations with the long-range dipole-dipole interactions under the quasi-one-dimensional confinement, where the interaction can be tuned by tilting the dipoles along the system coordinate. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show how the liquid-gas phase transition occurs in this system, and elucidate the finite-temperature phase structure consisting of the gas phase, liquid phase, their coexistence, and the spinodal phase. We also discuss its similarity with the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter through the comparison with phenomenological models. Our results would be useful for an interdisciplinary understanding of self-bound fermionic matter as well as an analog quantum simulation of nuclear systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermalization and time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate formation in ultracold Dy-164 using a nonlinear boson diffusion equation. As compared to alkali atoms such as K-39 or Rb-87, the strong magnetic dipole interaction modifies the scattering-length dependence of the transport coefficients that govern thermalization and condensate formation. A prediction for the time-dependent condensate fraction in Dy-164 is made.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover and finite-range effects in a quasi-two-dimensional gas of fermionic dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of ultracold two-component Fermi gases in the presence of a transverse harmonic potential, focusing on the strongly interacting regime in which pairs of fermions form tightly bound molecules. Using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate the equation of state and density profiles for the full fermionic system, which allows us to address the importance of finite-range corrections arising from the internal fermionic structure of the composite bosons. We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions. We also develop an analytical theory for the transverse density profile, capturing its broadening with increasing interaction strength. This work provides a benchmark for an effective bosonic description of strongly bound fermionic dimers and offers new insights into the three- to two-dimensional crossover.</description>

      <title>Programmable Assembly of Ground State Fermionic Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09849v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above $98.5\,\%$. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single $20\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ exposure, and $3\,\mathrm{s}$ experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an imaging scheme for quantum gases that enables simultaneous detection of two spin states with single-atom resolution. It utilizes the polarization of the emitted photons during fluorescence by choosing appropriate internal states of lithium-6 atoms in a magnetic field. This scheme can readily be implemented to obtain in-situ spin correlations in a wide variety of experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Connecting single-layer $t$-$J$ to Kondo lattice models: Exploration with cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, emerges from the antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and conduction fermions, leading to a correlated many-body singlet state. Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Extreme statistics as a probe of the superfluid to Bose-glass Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains have highlighted the role of rare, chain-breaking events that favor localization, in particular for high-energy eigenstates related to many-body localization. In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.</description>

      <title>Photon condensation from thermal sources and the limits of heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye, or by coupling the cavity modes to a thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We find that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for pumping of the modes of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. Our results show that photon condensates can be produced by pumping with incoherent thermal sources, opening possibilities for coherent light generation, energy harvesting, and experimental studies of quantum heat engines.</description>
