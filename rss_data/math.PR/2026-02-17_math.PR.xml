      <title>Reversible birth-and-death dynamics in continuum: a de Bruijn-type identity for free-energy dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate free-energy dissipation in a continuous-time birth-and-death dynamics in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For these Markov processes, the class of reversible measures coincides with the infinite-volume Gibbs point processes for some sufficiently nice Hamiltonian. For a wide class of initial distributions, we derive a de~Bruijn-type identity that relates the time evolution of the specific relative entropy along trajectories to the Fisher information, in particular establishing the thermodynamic limit of the latter. Along the way, we analyze some fine properties of the considered dynamics, such as the existence and regularity of local densities, obtain a spatial ergodic theorem for the entropy production per unit volume, and derive a small-time exponential series expansion of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for a class of random outer measures in infinite urn schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An urn scheme is a probabilistic model in which balls are placed into urns sequentially and independently of each other. All balls share the same probability distribution for hitting the urns. In the simplest case, there is a finite number of urns and the probabilities of hitting each urn are equal. In an infinite urn scheme, there is a countable number of urns, and the hitting probabilities form a probability mass function on the set of urn labels, so they depend on the urn number. The statistics of interest is the number of urns with at least k balls after throwing n balls. Thus, we assume that there is a countable family of urns, and we fix the probabilities for a ball to hit each urn (the same for all balls). For an arbitrary subset A of the unit interval [0, 1], we do not consider all ball indices from 1 to n, but only those that belong to the set nA, and we study the number of urns with at least k balls after throwing the balls with indices in nA. This number is non-negative, and if the set A is empty, this number is equal to zero. Moreover, if k=1, then it satisfies the property of countable subadditivity. Hence, the number of non-empty urns for ball indices in nA, where A is an arbitrary subset of the unit interval, satisfies all the axioms of an outer measure on the unit interval. We study the properties of the statistics of interest. Our main result is a functional central limit theorem for sets A consisting of finite unions of intervals and parameterized by their boundary points. We consider applications of this theorem to elementary probabilistic models of text.</description>

      <title>Some properties of G-SVIEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the solvability of G-SVIEs under two cases: time-varying Lipschitz coefficients and integral-Lipschitz coefficients. Using the Picard iteration method, we established the existence and uniqueness of solutions to G-SVIEs under these two conditions. Additionally, we prove the continuity of the solution with respect to parameters in parameter-dependent G-SVIEs with Lipschitz coefficients.</description>

      <title>Robust Filtering of L\'evy-driven Stochastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study robust nonlinear filtering for stochastic models driven by L\'evy processes, where the signal and observation processes are coupled through common Brownian and jump noise. Robustness, defined as the continuous dependence of the filter on the observation path, is essential whenever the observation process deviates from the idealized model, for instance when a path must be reconstructed from discrete-time samples. This question is well understood for continuous semimartingale systems but largely open in the presence of jumps.
  We construct a version of the filter and establish its continuity in two regimes. For processes with finitely many jumps on compact intervals, we prove continuity in both the rough $p$-variation and $p$-variation topologies on cadlag path space, without requiring a separability condition on the jump coefficients. For processes with infinitely many jumps, we prove continuity in a modified rough $p$-variation topology adapted to cadlag geometric rough paths, under an additional separability assumption. In both cases, our approach relies on Stratonovich and Marcus flow decompositions rather than the It\^o-based methods of recent work. The resulting geometric rough-path lifts yield pathwise convergence guarantees and can be constructed directly from discrete observations without knowledge of the underlying probability law.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for consensus-based minimax algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-population convergence of a consensus-based algorithm for the saddle point problem proposed by ArXiv: 2212.12334, establishing the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos using a coupling method. Our work shows that the $L^2$-deviation has order $O(N_1^{-1} + N_2^{-1})$ uniformly in time, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ denote the numbers of particles corresponding to the two competing players.
  It demonstrates the convergence of the particles to some location near a saddle point of the given objective function, which confirms the computational feasibility of the algorithm.
  The main idea behind the proofs is the exponential decay and the concentration of the variances of the particle system.</description>

      <title>Conditional Expectation expression in mean-field SDEs and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study developed a novel formulation of conditional expectations within the framework of a jump-diffusion mean-field stochastic differential equation. We introduce an integrated approach that combines unconditioned expectations with rigorously defined weighting factors, employing Malliavin calculus on Poisson space and directional derivatives to enhance estimation accuracy. \noindent The proposed method is applied to the numerical pricing of American put options in a jump-diffusion mean-field setting, addressing the challenges proposed by early-exercise features. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in pricing accuracy compared with conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>On Anti-Confinement Estimates for Self-Repelling Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of $d$-dimensional random walks, including the two-dimensional simple random walk, reweighted by a self-repelling Gibbsian pair potential. We prove lower bounds on the diffusion constant for short-range interactions, and superdiffusive behavior in case the interaction is sufficiently long-range. Finally, we show that in the superdiffusive regime, faster temporal decay can be compensated by stronger spatial repulsion and vice-versa. Our technique combines GKS-based correlation inequalities on path space with recursive multi-scale estimates.</description>

      <title>Jucys--Murphy Elements for Wreath Products and Their Application to Dynamical Random Multi-Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalence classes of irreducible representations of wreath product $\mathfrak{S}_n(T) = T^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ of finite group $T$ with respect to symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are parametrized by $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, the $\lvert \widehat{T}\rvert$-tuple Young diagrams with total size $n$. We show a formula connecting the Kerov transition measures of these Young diagrams with the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\mathfrak{S}_n(T)$. This formula is due to Biane in the case of symmetric groups. The formula enables us to investigate asymptotic property of the shapes of multi-diagrams through combinatorial analysis for the Jucys--Murphy elements. On the other hand, a Markov chain is introduced on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, canonically reflecting the branching rule for the tower of wreath product groups. We have a continuous time stochastic process on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$ from this chain by replacing the discrete time by a counting process. Our project is to specify the deterministic limit shape of multi-diagrams at each macroscopic time through appropriate space-time scaling limit, and to describe evolution of related quantities characterizing the shape. Especially, we derive dynamical concentrated limit shapes in the case of abelian $T$ by using free probability tools under the assumption of approximate factorization property for initial ensembles with an additional property of a pausing time distribution.</description>

      <title>Infection models on dense dynamic random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models on dense dynamic random graphs, in which the joint dynamics of vertices and edges are co-evolutionary, i.e., they influence each other bidirectionally. In particular, edges appear and disappear over time depending on the states of the two connected vertices, on how long they have been infected, and on the total density of susceptible and infected vertices. Our main results establish functional laws of large numbers for the densities of susceptible, infected, and recovered vertices, jointly with the underlying evolving random graphs in the graphon space. Our results are supported by simulations, which characterize the limiting size of the epidemics, i.e., the limiting density of susceptible vertices, and how the peak of the epidemics depends on the rate of the evolution of the underlying graph.
  The proofs of our main results rely on the careful construction of a mimicking process, obtained by approximating the two-way feedback interaction between vertex and edge dynamics with a mean-field type interaction, acting only as one-way feedback, that remains sufficiently close to the original co-evolutionary process. To treat the more general setting in which edge dynamics are affected by the proportions of susceptible and infected individuals, we introduce a methodological extension of existing techniques. We thus show that our model exhibits multiple epidemic peaks -- a phenomenon observed in real-world epidemics -- which can emerge in models that incorporate mutual feedback between vertex and edge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Burgers equation driven by multiplicative Rosenblatt noise: local existence, uniqueness and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic Burgers equation driven by a multiplicative Rosenblatt noise with Hurst parameter $H \in (1/2,1)$. Using a fixed-point argument in a Malliavin--Sobolev space that controls the solution and its first two Malliavin derivatives, we prove local existence and uniqueness of a mild solution. We establish uniform moment bounds of all orders and prove H\"older regularity: spatial H\"older exponent $\gamma &lt; 1/2$ and temporal H\"older exponent $\alpha &lt; H-1/2$, which are shown to be sharp by a lower bound for the linearized equation. The proof relies on sharp estimates of the heat kernel in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\cH$ of the Rosenblatt process, on Meyer's inequalities for moment bounds, and on a careful analysis of the Skorohod integral with respect to the Rosenblatt process. These results provide a rigorous foundation for the study of nonlinear SPDEs driven by non-Gaussian long-memory noise.</description>

      <title>Finitary coding and Gaussian concentration for random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Gaussian concentration inequalities for random fields obtained as finitary codings of i.i.d.\ processes, establishing a natural bridge between finitary codings and concentration inequalities. A finitary coding formalizes how a random field with nontrivial dependence, such as the Ising model, can be generated from an i.i.d.\ source by a shift-equivariant map that determines each output spin from a finite, configuration-dependent window of the input. Gaussian concentration yields uniform sub-Gaussian fluctuation bounds for all local observables.
  Our main abstract result shows that Gaussian concentration is preserved under finitary codings of i.i.d.\ fields provided the coding volume has finite second moment. The proof relies on a refinement of the classical worst-case bounded-differences inequality of Talagrand and Marton, allowing us to exploit configuration-dependent bounds. Under an additional structural condition that we call the short-range factorization property, satisfied in particular by codings constructed via coupling-from-the-past algorithms, finite first moment of the coding volume already suffices. These moment conditions are sharp.
  Applications include Gibbs measures and Markov random fields on $\mathbb Z^d$, probabilistic cellular automata, and one-dimensional stochastic processes. For classical lattice models such as the Ising, Potts, and random-cluster models, we obtain sharp criteria for Gaussian concentration coinciding with uniqueness regimes. For countable-state Markov chains, we derive equivalent characterizations, including geometric ergodicity, exponential return-time tails, and the existence of finitary i.i.d.\ codings with exponential tails.</description>

      <title>Hua-Pickrell diffusions and differential equations related with pseudo-Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Assiotis (2020), we study general $\beta$-Hua-Pickrell diffusions of $N$ particles on $\mathbb R$ as solutions of the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) $$dX_{j,t}=\sqrt{2(1+X_{j,t}^2)}\,dB_{j,t}+\beta\left[b-a X_{j,t}+\sum_{l=1,\ldots, N; \&gt; l\neq j}\frac{X_{j,t}X_{l,t}+1}{X_{j,t}-X_{l,t}}\right]dt\,,\;\; (j=1,\ldots,N)$$ with $\beta\ge 1,\&gt; a,b\in\mathbb R$. These processes form a subclass of the Pearson diffusions which are defined as solutions of algebraic SDEs where the moments of the empirical distributions $\mu_t^N:=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{X_{j,t}}$ can be computed inductively. This Pearson class also contains other well known diffusions like Dyson Brownian motions, and multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi processes After the time normalization $t\mapsto t/\beta$, the SDEs above degenerate in the frozen case for $\beta=\infty$ into ordinary differential equations which are related to pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. For $N\to\infty$ and under suitable initial conditions, the empirical distributions $\mu_t^N$ converge weakly almost surely for $t&gt;0$ to some limit which is independent from $\beta\in[1,\infty]$. For $a=-N, b=0$, we describe the limit explicitly via free convolutions. Moreover, if $a=cN$ for some $c&gt;0$, the solutions of our SDEs converge for $t\to\infty$ to stationary distributions, which are Hua-Pickrell (or Cauchy) measures. We thus obtain connections between known results for the empirical distributions of these ensembles and the zeros of the pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore, we derive a freezing central limit theorem for $\beta\to\infty$ for the Hua-Pickrell ensembles which is related to these zeros.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of depth constants in general preferential attachment trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study insertion depth and tree height in preferential-attachment (PA) trees driven by a general attachment function $f:\mathbb{N}_0\to(0,\infty)$. Our main result is a monotonicity principle for the $\log n$-order constant of either functional: if $f$ dominates $g$ in ``growth-ratio'' order (a variant of the hazard ratio order of probability densities) then the typical depth constant for $f$ is no larger than for $g$, i.e. stronger reinforcement yields a shallower tree. The proofs use a one-parameter interpolation together with a gauge normalisation that removes a global derivative term, reducing the sign to a weighted correlation inequality for monotone sequences. Equivalently, the results can be phrased as monotonicity theorems for the corresponding branching process functionals arising from the standard embedding of the PA tree into a Crump--Mode--Jagers process.</description>

      <title>Peaks over Threshold in Scale-Free Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore extreme value phenomena in spatial scale-free random graphs in a continuum setting based on a homogeneous Poisson point process in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Vertices carry i.i.d. weights $(W_x)$ and, conditionally on the vertex set and the weights, edges are present independently with probability $p_{xy}=1-\exp\{-\lambda W_xW_y/|x-y|^\alpha\}$. Assuming Pareto-type weight tails with index $\beta&gt;0$ and working in parameter ranges where degrees are almost surely finite, we study extremes and peaks over thresholds (POT) of edge lengths in a growing observation window. Our focus is the precise impact of the presence of (large) weights on edge lengths, captured through explicit scaling regimes and conditional POT limit theorems. Our main results identify a three-phase behavior governed by the weight-tail parameter $\beta$. We both deduce Fr\'echet-type limits for the maximum edge length itself and we reveal POT structures under a hub conditioning by proving a POT limit theorem. In the finite-mean regime $\beta&gt;1$, the leading scaling agrees with the unweighted model up to a constant. By contrast, for $\beta\le 1$ the weights have a macroscopic effect on extreme edge lengths: for $\beta&lt; 1$ the scaling changes, and the borderline case $\beta=1$ exhibits additional logarithmic corrections. The proofs combine Stein-type Poisson approximation via a Palm-coupling approach with a refined treatment of the dependence created by the conditioning event.</description>

      <title>Convergence for linear quadratic potential mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the limits of empirical means of open-loop Nash equilibria of linear-quadratic stochastic differential games as the number of players goes to infinity, when the corresponding mean field game is of potential type and may have multiple equilibria. Via weak compactness arguments, the limit points are characterized as optimal trajectories of the related deterministic control problem, thus ruling out some of the mean field equilibria. Our result is obtained by first connecting the finite player game to a suitable control problem, whose optimal trajectories are the empirical means of Nash equilibria of the game, and in which the number of players $N$ becomes a parameter. True convergence to the unique minimizer of the limit control problem then holds for almost every initial mean. In cases of multiple optimizers, we focus on examples to show that some symmetry of the data ensures that the sequence admits a random limit which is distributes uniformly among the minimizers of the potential. Multidimensional examples of the convergence result appear here for the first time, which show the flexibility of our method. We also establish a similar convergence results for the corresponding linear-quadratic potential mean field games with common noise, as the noise vanishes.</description>

      <title>Random geometric graphs with smooth kernels: sharp detection threshold and a spectral conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random geometric graph (RGG) with kernel $K$ is constructed by first sampling latent points $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ independently and uniformly from the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, then connecting each pair $(i,j)$ with probability $K(\langle x_i,x_j\rangle)$. We study the sharp detection threshold, namely the highest dimension at which an RGG can be distinguished from its Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi counterpart with the same edge density.
  For dense graphs, we show that for smooth kernels the critical scaling is $d = n^{3/4}$, substantially lower than the threshold $d = n^3$ known for the hard RGG with step-function kernels \cite{bubeck2016testing}. We further extend our results to kernels whose signal-to-noise ratio scales with $n$, and formulate a unifying conjecture that the critical dimension is determined by $n^3 \mathop{\rm tr}^2(\kappa^3) = 1$, where $\kappa$ is the standardized kernel operator on the sphere.
  Departing from the prevailing approach of bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence by successively exposing latent points, which breaks down in the sublinear regime of $d=o(n)$, our key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the posterior distribution of the latent points given the observed graph, in particular, the overlap between two independent posterior samples. As a by-product, we establish that $d=\sqrt{n}$ is the critical dimension for non-trivial estimation of the latent vectors up to a global rotation.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic interpretation for interpolation Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams gave a probabilistic interpretation of the Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;1,t)$ at $q=1$ in terms of a Markov chain called the multispecies $t$-Push TASEP, a Markov chain involving particles of types $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ hopping around a ring. In particular, they showed that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$, and the normalizing constant (or partition function) is $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$. There is an inhomogeneous generalization of Macdonald polynomials due to Knop and Sahi called interpolation Macdonald polynomials $P^*_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$, as well as an inhomogeneous generalization of ASEP polynomials called interpolation ASEP polynomials $F^*_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ that we introduced in previous work. In this article we introduce a new Markov chain called the interpolation $t$-Push TASEP, and show that its steady state probabilities and partition function are given by the interpolation ASEP polynomials and the interpolation Macdonald polynomial, evaluated at $q=1$. This generalizes the previous result of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that under convergence in measure of probability density functions, differential entropy converges whenever the entropy integrands $f_n |\log f_n|$ are uniformly integrable and tight -- a direct consequence of Vitali's convergence theorem. We give an entropy-weighted Orlicz condition: $\sup_n \int f_n\, \Psi(|\log f_n|) &lt; \infty$ for a single superlinear $\Psi$, strictly weaker than the fixed-$\alpha$ condition of Godavarti and Hero (2004). We also disprove the Godavarti-Hero conjecture that $\alpha &gt; 1$ could be replaced by $\alpha_n \downarrow 1$. We recover the sufficient conditions of Godavarti-Hero, Piera-Parada, and Ghourchian-Gohari-Amini as corollaries, and we show the condition is also necessary on bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Caputo mean-square attractors for non-autonomous stochastic evolution systems. We first introduce the concept of Caputo mean-square attractors and then establish a sufficient criterion for existence of such attractors.As an application, we consider a non-autonomous Caputo fractional stochastic differential equation of order $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ in $L^2(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)$ with a driving system on a compact base space $P$ and tempered fractional noise.It is shown that this equation generates a Caputo mean-square random semi-dynamical system on $\mathfrak{C} \times P$ with a skew-product semi-flow structure,where $\mathfrak{C}$ denotes the space of continuous functions $f\in \mathbb{R}^{+}\rightarrow L^2(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^d)$. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this semi-dynamical system admits a Caputo mean-square attractor.</description>

      <title>An Improved Milstein Method for the Numerical Solution of Multidimensional Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) offer powerful and accessible mathematical models for capturing both deterministic and probabilistic aspects of dynamic behavior across a wide range of physical, financial, and social systems. However, analytical solutions for many SDEs are often unavailable, necessitating the use of numerical approximation methods. The rate of convergence of such numerical methods is of great importance, as it directly influences both computational efficiency and accuracy. This paper presents a proposed theorem, along with its proof, that facilitates the numerical evaluation of the strong (and weak) order of convergence of a numerical scheme for an SDE when the analytical solution is unavailable. Additionally, we address the challenge of numerically computing the multiple stochastic integrals required by the Milstein method to achieve improved convergence rates for multidimensional SDEs. In this context, two newly proposed numerical techniques for computing these multiple stochastic integrals are introduced and compared with existing approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The methodologies are further illustrated through simulation studies and applications to widely used financial models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a probabilistic cellular automaton obtained as a mixture of the additive elementary rules 60 and 102. We prove that, for any finite periodic lattice and for mixing parameter $\lambda=1/2$, the system almost surely reaches the absorbing all-zero configuration in finitely many steps. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations indicate as well the presence of a zero-density stationary state in a finite interval around $\lambda=1/2$. Despite this absorbing behavior, both mean-field and block approximation schemes predict a stationary state with non-zero density. This failure, traced to the additive and mirror symmetries of the deterministic components, highlights a fundamental limitation of finite-block approximation in capturing the global dynamics of probabilistic cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Behavior of Constant-Stepsize Stochastic Approximation: Gaussian Approximation and Tail Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constant-stepsize stochastic approximation (SA) is widely used in learning for computational efficiency. For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $\alpha \downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $\alpha$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $\alpha$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $\alpha^{1/2}\log(1/\alpha)$ for small $\alpha$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $\alpha$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives. We identify a non-Gaussian (Gibbs) limiting law under the correct scaling, which is validated numerically, and provide a corresponding pre-limit Wasserstein error bound.</description>

      <title>Vertex operators, infinite wedge representations, and correlation functions of the t-Schur measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $t$-Schur measure on partitions, defined by $ \mathbb{P}(\lambda)=Z^{-1}S_\lambda(x;t)s_\lambda(y) $, where $S_\lambda(x;t)$ denotes the $t$-Schur symmetric functions and $s_\lambda(y)$ the ordinary Schur functions, and $Z$ is the normalising constant. Using vertex operator calculus, we realise $S_\lambda(x;t)$ in the charged free-fermion Fock space, yielding a $t$-deformation of the classical boson-fermion correspondence. These realisations give vertex-algebraic proofs of the $t$-Cauchy identities and $t$-Gessel identity. Building on this framework, we compute the correlation functions of the $t$-Schur measure and show that the associated point process is determinantal, with an explicit correlation kernel. The Poissonised $t$-Plancherel measure appears as a specialisation of our construction, so its correlation functions follow as a corollary. As an application, we derive the limiting distribution for the length of the longest ascent pair in a random permutation. Our results interpolate the Schur case at $t=0$, connect to the Schur-$Q$ theory at $t=-1$, and provide a probabilistic interpretation of a natural $t$-refinement of increasing subsequences via a generalised RSK correspondence.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Sobolev, Poincar\'e and Beckner Inequalities on Hyperbolic Spaces and Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate several functional and geometric inequalities on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^N$, with a primary emphasis on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, Poincar\'e inequalities, and Beckner-type inequalities, all studied within the framework of the AB program. The main analytical tool employed throughout this paper is symmetrization. More precisely, our approach relies on an improved version of the P\'olya-Szeg\"o inequality on the hyperbolic space, obtained through a careful comparison of the gradient norms of rearranged functions in the hyperbolic and Euclidean settings. For Beckner-type inequalities, we adopt a semigroup approach based on sharp estimates for the heat semigroup, leading to refined interpolation inequalities between Poincar\'e and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Finally, we extend our results beyond hyperbolic space to a class of Riemannian model manifolds $\mathbb{M}^N$ satisfying the centered isoperimetric inequality. This shows that the inequalities and methods developed in this work are robust and rely mainly on geometric and isoperimetric properties, rather than on the specific structure of hyperbolic space itself.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new higher-order time discretization scheme for the stochastic Navier--Stokes equations with additive noise, where its velocity and pressure approximates converge at strong rate $1.5$ in probability. The construction rests on its reformulation as a random PDE for the transform $y = u- \Phi W$, and different higher order numerical quadrature rules for the diffusion and the drift part. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that high-accuracy guarantees for log-concave sampling -- that is, iteration and query complexities which scale as $\mathrm{poly}\log(1/\delta)$, where $\delta$ is the desired target accuracy -- are achievable using stochastic gradients with subexponential tails. Notably, this exhibits a separation with the problem of convex optimization, where stochasticity (even additive Gaussian noise) in the gradient oracle incurs $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ queries. We also give an information-theoretic argument that light-tailed stochastic gradients are necessary for high accuracy: for example, in the bounded variance case, we show that the minimax-optimal query complexity scales as $\Theta(1/\delta)$. Our framework also provides similar high accuracy guarantees under stochastic zeroth order (value) queries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of weak Poincar\'{e} inequalities, we analyze the convergence properties of deterministic-scan Metropolis-within-Gibbs samplers, an important class of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Our analysis applies to nonreversible Markov chains and yields explicit (subgeometric) convergence bounds through novel comparison techniques based on Dirichlet forms. We show that the joint chain inherits the convergence behavior of the marginal chain and conversely. In addition, we establish several fundamental results for weak Poincar\'{e} inequalities for discrete-time Markov chains, such as a tensorization property for independent chains. We apply our theoretical results through applications to algorithms for Bayesian inference for a hierarchical regression model and a diffusion model under discretely-observed data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any dimension $n$, we determine the Cheeger constant and the Cheeger sets of the Gaussian mixture $\mu(x) = p\gamma(x-a) + (1-p)\gamma(x-b)$, where $p \in [0,1]$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\gamma : \mathbb{R}^n \to (0,\infty)$ denotes a Gaussian. In particular, we characterize the Cheeger sets for $\mu$ in terms of specific half-spaces perpendicular to $a-b$, thereby confirming the conjectured solution to the Cheeger problem for Gaussian mixtures. Finally, we study the regime of parameters $p,a,b$ in which $\mu$ admits a unique Cheeger set.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Specific Relative Entropy between Continuous Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel notion of divergence between continuous martingales; the reciprocal specific relative entropy. First, we motivate this definition from multiple perspectives. Thereafter, we solve the reciprocal specific relative entropy minimization problem over the set of win-martingales (used as models for prediction markets Aldous (2013)). Surprisingly, we show that the optimizer is the renowned neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion. We also justify that this diffusion is in a sense the most salient win-martingale, since it is uniquely selected when we suitably perturb the degenerate martingale optimal transport problem of variance minimization.</description>

      <title>The antiferromagnetic Ising model beyond line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the antiferromagnetic Ising model and the hard-core model could be said to be tractable on line graphs of bounded degree. For example, Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing in both cases. In the case of the hard-core model, we know that tractability extends further, to claw-free graphs and somewhat beyond. In contrast, it is shown here that the corresponding extensions are not possible in the case of the antiferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sinh-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic defocusing sinh-Gordon model with parameter $\beta^2&gt;0$ and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. We establish global well-posedness of the model for a certain range of parameters $\beta^2&gt;0$ with the corresponding Gibbs measure initial data and prove invariance of the Gibbs measure under the flow, thereby resolving a question posed by Oh, Robert, and Wang (2019). Our physical space approach hinges on developing a novel $L^\infty$-based well-posedness theory for wave equations with exponential-type nonlinearities, going beyond the classical $L^2$-based framework. This refinement allows us to fully leverage structural properties of Gaussian multiplicative chaos. As a by-product of our method, we also obtain an improved well-posedness theory for the hyperbolic Liouville model.</description>

      <title>Planar site percolation via tree embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00923v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected planar graph that is properly embedded in $\RR^2$ and has minimal vertex degree at least $7$. We prove that for i.i.d.\ $\mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)$ site percolation on $G$, for every \[ p \in \bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\, 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr), \] there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open $(1$-)$\,$clusters. In particular, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;\tfrac12$, so the non-uniqueness interval is nonempty. This verifies Conjecture~7 of Benjamini and Schramm~\cite{bs96} for this class of properly embedded planar graphs.
  The main new ingredient is an explicit construction of trees embedded in $G$ with controlled local geometry (degrees $3$ and $4$ away from the root). These trees yield non-uniqueness near $p=\tfrac12$ and, via an embedded forest of pairwise disjoint trees, imply exponential decay of two-point connection probabilities in the matching graph $G_*$. To treat the complementary regime $p&gt;\tfrac12$, we introduce a ``binary-tree'' version of uniform percolation that yields stability of infinite clusters under edge additions without any bounded-degree assumption.
  Beyond planarity, we also obtain a general two-point connectivity inequality on arbitrary infinite, connected locally finite graphs, which implies a non-transitive criterion for the existence of infinitely many infinite clusters in the regime $p_c&lt;p&lt;p_{\mathrm{conn}}$.</description>

      <title>The effect of reducible Markov modulation on tail probabilities in models of random growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent economic literature deals with models of random growth in which the size of economic agents is subject to light-tailed Markov-modulated additive shocks. It has been shown that if Markov modulation is irreducible then the models give rise to a distribution of sizes across agents whose upper tail resembles, in a particular sense, that of an exponential distribution. We show that while this need not be the case under reducible Markov modulation, the upper tail will nevertheless resemble that of an Erlang distribution. A novel extension of the Rothblum index theorem allows us to characterize the Erlang shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>

Abstract: We consider a pinning model in correlated Gaussian random environments. For the model that is disorder relevant, we study its intermediate disorder regime and show that the rescaled partition functions converge to a non-trivial continuum limit in the Skorohod setting and in the Stratonovich setting, respectively. Our results partially confirm the Weinrib--Halperin prediction for disorder relevance/irrelevance.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [12] and [13, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of the latter work and of [20]. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. We also establish a quenched homogenization result in the sense that the leading order of the minimal energy becomes deterministic as the ratio system size / lattice spacing diverges. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our estimate of the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles of derivative type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the biorthogonal ensembles that are both a multiple orthogonal polynomial ensemble and a polynomial ensemble of derivative type (also called a P\'olya ensemble). We focus on the notions of multiplicative and additive derivative type that typically appear in connection with products and sums of random matrices respectively. Essential in the characterization is the use of the Mellin and Laplace transform: we show that the derivative type structure, which is a priori analytic in nature, becomes algebraic after applying the appropriate transform. Afterwards, we use the characterization to show that the eigenvalue densities of products of JUE and LUE matrices are essentially the only multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles of multiplicative derivative type. We also show that the eigenvalue densities of sums of dilated LUE and GUE matrices are examples of multiple orthogonal polynomial ensemble of additive derivative type, but provide other examples as well. Finally, we explain how these notions of derivative type can be used to provide a partial solution to an open problem related to orthogonality of the finite finite free multiplicative and additive convolution of polynomials from finite free probability. In particular, we obtain families of multiple orthogonal polynomials that (de)compose naturally using these convolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multisets are like sets, except that they can contain multiple copies of their elements. If there are $n_i$ copies of $i$, $1\leq i\leq t$, in multiset $M_t$, then there are $\binom{n_1+\cdots+n_t}{n_1,\ldots, n_t}$ possible permutations of $M_t$. Knuth showed how to factor any multiset permutation into cycles. For fixed $n_i$, $i\geq 1$, we show how to adapt the Chinese restaurant process, which generates random permutations on $n$ elements with weighting $\theta^{\# \, {\rm cycles}}$, $\theta&gt;0$, sequentially for $n=1,2,\ldots$, to the multiset case, where we fix the $n_i$ and build permutations on $M_t$ sequentially for $t=1,2,\ldots$. The number of cycles of a multiset permutation chosen uniformly at random, i.e.~$\theta=1$, has distribution given by the sum of independent negative hypergeometric distributed random variables. For all $\theta&gt;0$, and under the assumption that $n_i=O(1)$, we show a central limit theorem as $t\to\infty$ for the number of cycles.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic minimax and submodular optimization algorithms for multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an information-theoretic minimax problem for finite multivariate Markov chains on $d$-dimensional product state spaces. Given a family $\mathcal B=\{P_1,\ldots,P_n\}$ of $\pi$-stationary transition matrices and a class $\mathcal F = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{S})$ of factorizable models induced by a partition $\mathbf S$ of the coordinate set $[d]$, we seek to minimize the worst-case information loss by analyzing $$\min_{Q\in\mathcal F}\max_{P\in\mathcal B} D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\pi}(P\|Q),$$ where $D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\pi}(P\|Q)$ is the $\pi$-weighted KL divergence from $Q$ to $P$. We recast the above minimax problem into concave maximization over the $n$-probability-simplex via strong duality and Pythagorean identities that we derive. This leads us to formulate an information-theoretic game and show that a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium always exists; and propose a projected subgradient algorithm to approximately solve the minimax problem with provable guarantee. By transforming the minimax problem into an orthant submodular function in $\mathbf{S}$, this motivates us to consider a max-min-max submodular optimization problem and investigate a two-layer subgradient-greedy procedure to approximately solve this generalization. Numerical experiments for Markov chains on the Curie-Weiss and Bernoulli-Laplace models illustrate the practicality of these proposed algorithms and reveals sparse optimal structures in these examples.</description>

      <title>Planar Site Percolation, End Structure, and the Benjamini-Schramm Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected, locally finite planar graph and consider i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation. Write $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ and $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ for the critical and uniqueness thresholds. Using a well--separated Freudenthal embedding $G\hookrightarrow\mathbb S^2$, we introduce a cycle--separation equivalence on ends and associated ``directional'' thresholds $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$.
  When the set of end--equivalence classes is countable, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)=\inf_F p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$ and that for every $p\in\bigl(\tfrac12,\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$ there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open clusters. Combined with the $0/\infty$ theorem of Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for $p\le \tfrac12$, this yields non--uniqueness throughout the full coexistence interval $\bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$, and hence $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\ge 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ in this setting. This resolves the extension problem posed by Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for the upper half of the coexistence regime under a natural countability hypothesis.
  In contrast, for graphs with uncountably many end--equivalence classes we give criteria guaranteeing infinitely many infinite clusters above criticality, and we construct an explicit locally finite planar graph of minimum degree at least $7$ for which $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$. Consequently, the Benjamini--Schramm conjecture (Conjecture 7 in \cite{bs96}) that planarity together with minimal vertex degree at least 7 forces infinitely many infinite clusters for all $p\in(p_c,1-p_c)$ does not hold in full generality.
  Our proofs combine a cutset characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ with a planar alternating--arm exploration organized by an end--adapted boundary decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that if a random vector satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality, all of its marginals have subgaussian tails. In the spirit of the KLS conjecture, we investigate whether this implication can be reversed under a log-concavity assumption. In the general setting, we improve on a result of Bobkov, establishing the best dimension dependent bound on the log-Sobolev constant of subgaussian log-concave measures, and we investigate some special cases.</description>

      <title>A stochastic perturbation approach to nonlinear bifurcating problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating probabilistic terms in mathematical models is crucial for capturing and quantifying uncertainties in real-world systems, especially when the solution is not unique or exhibits sudden qualitative changes as parameters vary. However, stochastic models typically require large computational resources to produce meaningful statistics. In this work, we leverage the Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion to propose a systematic approach for bifurcation detection in parametric systems of equations. We show that the method, exploiting a perturbed version of the deterministic model, avoids repeated costly simulations across multiple parameter values and requires no prior information for initializing numerical solvers, while still providing accurate characterization of the bifurcation branches. We argue that the PC solutions of the perturbed model not only provide access to statistical information about the deterministic branches, but also approximate these branches in a meaningful sense. Finally, we validate our claims by means of numerical tests on the pitchfork bifurcation, examining both its normal form and a classical realization in fluid-dynamics PDEs, namely the Coanda effect.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Framework for Stochastic Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns models and convergence principles for dealing with stochasticity in a wide range of algorithms arising in nonlinear analysis and optimization in Hilbert spaces. It proposes a flexible geometric framework within which existing solution methods can be recast and improved, and new ones can be designed. Almost sure weak, strong, and linear convergence results are established in particular for stochastic fixed point iterations, the stochastic gradient descent method, and stochastic extrapolated parallel algorithms for feasibility problems. In these areas, the proposed algorithms exceed the features and convergence guarantees of the state of the art. Numerical applications to signal and image recovery are provided.</description>

      <title>A mixed finite element method for a class of fourth-order stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete, semi-implicit mixed finite element method for approximating solutions to a class of fourth-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz and non-monotone nonlinearities, perturbed by spatially smooth multiplicative Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme is applicable to a range of physically relevant nonlinear models, including the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (sLLBar) equation, the stochastic convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with mass source, and the stochastic regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, among others. To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated system converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated problem. Assuming initial data in $\mathbb{H}^2$, we utilise parabolic smoothing estimates and the temporal H\"older continuity of the solution to establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation. Numerical simulations are provided to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Rectified Flows and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions. Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically) solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously acknowledged. In particular, we present several counterexamples that invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.</description>

      <title>Equality of H\"older exponents for distribution functions of Gibbs measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pointwise H\"older exponents describe the degree of regularity of a function near a point. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, a number $\alpha&gt;0$ and a point $t_0\in\mathbb{R}$, write $f\in C^\alpha(t_0)$ if there is a constant $C$ and a polynomial $P$ of degree less than $\alpha$ such that \[ |f(t)-P(t-t_0)|\leq C|t-t_0|^\alpha \qquad\mbox{for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$}. \] The pointwise H\"older exponent of $f$ at $t_0$ is the number \[ \alpha_f(t_0):=\sup\{\alpha&gt;0: f\in C^\alpha(t_0)\}. \] A simpler quantity, also frequently called pointwise H\"older exponent in the mathematical literature, is the number \[ \tilde{\alpha}_f(t_0):=\sup\{\alpha&gt;0: f\in \tilde{C}^\alpha(t_0)\}, \] where $f\in \tilde{C}^\alpha(t_0)$ means that there is a constant $C&gt;0$ such that $|f(t)-f(t_0)|\leq C|t-t_0|^\alpha$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. Clearly $\alpha_f(t)\geq \tilde{\alpha}_f(t)$, but strict inequality is possible and in fact common. In this paper we consider the case when $f=F_\mu$ is the distribution function of a Gibbs measure $\mu$ associated with an arbitrary H\"older continuous potential $\psi$ on a self-conformal set, and show that, under a very mild condition on $\psi$, $\alpha_f(t)=\tilde{\alpha}_f(t)$ for all $t$. As a consequence, we deduce that the pointwise H\"older spectrum of $f$ satisfies the multifractal formalism. As an application, we derive the pointwise H\"older spectrum of conjugacy maps between expanding piecewise $\mathcal{C}^{1+\epsilon}$ maps of an interval.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isoperimetric problem is a classic topic in geometric measure theory, yet critical questions regarding the characterization of optimal solutions -- even asymptotically optimal ones -- remain largely unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $(M,\nu)$ is a weighted Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Bakry--\'Emery--Ricci curvature. We establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetric inequality and the nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime. Although our results are stated for product spaces, they imply certain isoperimetric inequalities for non-product spaces, e.g., they can be used to recover the weaker equivalence established by Ledoux and Bobkov for arbitrary non-product spaces or used to establish quantitative relations among the optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities for product or non-product spaces. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea is a new framework which integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein Duality beyond Hausdorff and Kantorovich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality guarantees coincidence between metrics on the space of probability distributions defined on the one hand via transport plans (couplings) and on the other hand via price functions. Both constructions have been lifted to the level of generality of set functors, with the construction based on couplings referred to as the Wasserstein or simply the coupling-based lifting, and the price-function-based construction as the Kantorovich or codensity lifting, both based on a choice of quantitative modalities for the given functor. It is known that every coupling-based lifting can be expressed as a price-function-based lifting; however, the latter in general needs to use additional modalities. We give an example showing that this cannot be avoided in general. We refer to cases in which the same modalities can be used as satisfying the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality. We establish the generalized Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality in this sense for two important cases: The L\'evy-Prokhorov distance on distributions, which finds wide-spread applications in machine learning due to its favourable stability properties, and the standard metric on convex sets of distributions that arises by combining the Hausdorff and Kantorovich-Rubinstein distances.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Asymptotics of Differentially Private PCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, statistics of a sensitive dataset are privatized by introducing random noise. Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\rightarrow\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Mean-Field BSDEs and Exponential Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of real-valued mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with generators of quadratic growth in the control variable and the mean-field term. Under this assumption, together with a bounded terminal condition, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Our approach departs from classical fixed-point arguments and instead combines Malliavin calculus with refined BMO and stability estimates. The result bridges the gap between the quadratic BSDE results of [Ann. Probab. 45 (2017), pp.~3795--3828] and Hao et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab. 35 (2025), pp.~2128--2174]. Moreover, motivated by the structure of the mean-field exponential utility maximization problem introduced in our paper, we extend our framework to terminal conditions without continuity or the Markovian assumption. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions under a smallness terminla value on the terminal conditions. We then apply this extended theory to solve a mean-field exponential utility maximization problem, which developing the classical framework of Hu et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab. 15 (2005), pp.~1691--1712] to a fully coupled quadratic mean-field setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose in this short note a prime numbers-based method for constructing probability measures on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces annihilating all finite-dimensional subspaces, supplementing the methods of construction of Gaussian measures and infinite-product-type probability measures. This new method confirms that probability measures with this property are generic amongst probability measures that are not supported on finite-dimensional subspaces. In the process, we show the existence of an uncountable measurable family of independent vectors having the cardinality of the continuum in any infinite-dimensional Banach space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its elementary definition, the self-avoiding walk (SAW) poses notoriously hard enumerative problems: exact connective constants are known for only a handful of infinite graphs, notably the honeycomb lattice \cite{ds}. We establish a general substitution principle for SAWs on infinite connected quasi-transitive cubic graphs under port-transitive vertex replacements, where each degree-$3$ vertex is replaced by a fixed finite three-port gadget. Writing $g(x)$ for the associated two-port SAW series, we prove that for $G_1=\phi(G)$, \[ \mu(G)^{-1}=g\bigl(\mu(G_1)^{-1}\bigr), \] equivalently $\mu(G_1)^{-1}$ is the unique solution $x\in(0,1)$ of $g(x)=\mu(G)^{-1}$, thereby extending the Fisher-triangle relation of Grimmett--Li to arbitrary symmetric three-port gadgets. We also obtain the corresponding identity for bipartite graphs when one or both colour classes are transformed, and show that the critical exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ (and $\nu$ under a standard regularity hypothesis) are invariant. For explicit gadget families, including complete-graph gadgets $K_N$ and Fisher-type constructions, these identities turn base graphs with known $\mu$ into infinite families of new quasi-transitive graphs whose connective constants are determined exactly as the unique roots of explicit algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exploration in Global Optimization by Noise Injection in the Probability Measures Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: McKean-Vlasov (MKV) systems provide a unifying framework for recent state-of-the-art particlebased methods for global optimization. While individual particles follow stochastic trajectories, the probability law evolves deterministically in the mean-field limit, potentially limiting exploration in multimodal landscapes. We introduce two principled approaches to inject noise directly into the probability law dynamics: a perturbative method based on conditional MKV theory, and a geometric approach leveraging tangent space structure. While these approaches are of independent interest, the aim of this work is to apply them to global optimization. Our framework applies generically to any method that can be formulated as a MKV system. Extensive experiments on multimodal objective functions demonstrate that both our noise injection strategies enhance consistently the exploration and convergence across different configurations of dynamics, such as Langevin, Consensus-Based Optimization, and Stein Boltzmann Sampling, providing a versatile toolkit for global optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides sufficient conditions over the sequence of samples and parameters of an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to ensure ergodicity with respect to a target distribution that can have unbounded support. These conditions aim to make more easily usable the conditions of Containment and Diminishing Adaptation from Roberts and Rosenthal [2007] formulated over the transition kernels, without needing, as was done in other works, an artificial assumption of the compactness over both sample and parameter spaces. The paper shows that the condition of compactness can be relaxed to a more realistic bound in probability over the sequence of both samples and parameters.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</description>

      <title>General-purpose post-sampling reweighting method for multimodal target measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When sampling multi-modal probability distributions, correctly estimating the relative probability of each mode, even when the modes have been discovered and locally sampled, remains challenging. We test a simple reweighting scheme designed for this situation, which consists in minimizing (in terms of weights) the Kullback-Leibler divergence of a weighted (regularized) empirical distribution of the samples with respect to the target measure.</description>
