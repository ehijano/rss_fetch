      <title>Ionomeric extracellular matrices for dynamic soft robotic tissue engineering devices through protein sulfonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on pharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical cell identities emerge from animal gene regulatory mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchical organisation of cell identity is a fundamental feature of animal development with rich and well-characterized experimental phenomenology, yet the mechanisms driving its emergence remain unknown. The regulation of cell identity genes relies on a distinct mechanism involving higher-order interactions of transcription factors on distant regulatory regions called enhancers. These interactions are mediated by epigenetic regulators that are broadly shared between enhancers. Through the development of a new and predictive mathematical theory on the effects of epigenetic regulator activity on gene network dynamics, we demonstrate that hierarchical identities are essential emergent properties of animal-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. Hierarchical identities arise from the interplay between enhancer competition for epigenetic readers and cooperation through activation of shared transcriptional programs. We show that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms provide the network with self-similar properties that enable multilineage priming and signal-dependent control of progenitor states. The stabilisation of progenitor states is predicted to be controlled by the balance in activities between epigenetic writers and erasers. Our model quantitatively predicts lineage relationships, reconstructs all known blood progenitor states from terminal states, and explains mechanisms of cell identity dysregulation in cancer and the general differentiation effects of histone deacetylase inhibition. We identify non-specific modulation of enhancer competition as a central regulatory axis, with implications for developmental biology, cancer, and differentiation therapy.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a general stochastic dynamics model for these cases, namely a chiral active particle with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque, which implies a finite correlation time for internal noise. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. We finally provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.</description>
