      <title>On the integrable six-wave interaction system and its space-time shifted reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-dimensional six-wave interaction system is derived in the context of nonlinear optics. Starting from Maxwell's equations, a reduced system of equations governing the dynamics of the electric and polarization fields are obtained. Using a space-time multi-scale asymptotic expansion, a hierarchy of coupled equations describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the perturbed electric and polarization fields are derived. The leading order equation admits a six-wave ansatz satisfying a triad resonance condition. By removing secular terms at next order, a first order in space and time quadratically nonlinear coupled six-wave interaction system is obtained. This resulting system is tied to its integrable counterpart which was postulated by Ablowitz and Haberman in the 1970s. A reduction to a space-time shifted nonlocal three-wave system is presented. The resulting system is solved using the inverse scattering transform, which employs nonlocal symmetries between the associated eigenfunctions and scattering data; soliton solutions are then obtained. Finally, an infinite set of conservation laws for the six-wave system is derived; one is shown to be connected to its Hamiltonian structure.</description>

      <title>Invariant volume form for 3D QRT maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a three-dimensional generalization of QRT maps. These novel maps can be associated with pairs of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. By construction, these maps have two rational integrals (parameters of both pencils). In the present paper, we find an invariant volume form for these maps, thus finally establishing their integrability.</description>

      <title>Inverse Scattering Method Solves the Problem of Full Statistics of Nonstationary Heat Transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02474v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the full statistics of nonstationary heat transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti lattice gas model at long times by uncovering and exploiting complete integrability of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. These equations are closely related to the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLS), and we solve them by the Zakharov-Shabat inverse scattering method (ISM) adapted by Kaup and Newell (1978) for the DNLS. We obtain explicit results for the exact large deviation function of the transferred heat for an initially localized heat pulse, where we uncover a nontrivial symmetry relation.</description>

      <title>Complete Integrability of the Problem of Full Statistics of Nonstationary Mass Transfer in the Simple Inclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19536v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simple Inclusion Process (SIP) interpolates between two well-known lattice gas models: the independent random walkers and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model. Here we study large deviations of nonstationary mass transfer in the SIP at long times in one dimension. We suppose that $N\gg 1$ particles start from a single lattice site at the origin, and we are interested in the probability $\mathcal{P}(M,N,T)$ of observing $M$ particles, $0\leq M\leq N$, to the right of the origin at a specified time $T\gg 1$. At large times, the corresponding probability distribution has a large-deviation behavior, $-\ln \mathcal{P}(M,N,T) \simeq \sqrt{T} s(M/N,N/\sqrt{T})$. We determine the rate function $s$ exactly by uncovering and utilizing complete integrability, by the inverse scattering method, of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. We also analyze different asymptotic limits of the rate function $s$.</description>

      <title>From deep to shallow water 2D wave turbulence: Emergence of soliton gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on 2D random water wave propagation in a large wave tank are analyzed when the effect of dispersion changes. A stereoscopic profilometry technique is used to measure the water surface displacement resolved in both time and space over a significant fraction of the wave tank. The wave regimes are characterized by analyzing the space-time spectral statistical properties of the wave field. At a given, finite, water depth, the effect of dispersion can be varied by tuning the peak frequency of the wave generation. In shallow water conditions, the waves are only weakly dispersive and this enables the propagation of solitons. {In these conditions random wave forcing produces soliton gases}. In deep water conditions, the waves are dispersive and for wideband spectra, one observes the development of weak turbulence. A transition between these regimes is observed when changing the peak forcing frequency (dispersion) and the wave amplitude (nonlinearity), with a clear threshold between states with solitons and soliton-less states. The development of a soliton gas is associated with a strong change of the wave spectrum as well as a significant evolution of the distribution of the water elevation. We also observed a strong effect of the finite size of the tank due to the peculiar reflection laws of line solitons.</description>

      <title>Exact BPS double-kinks in generalized $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$ and sine-Gordon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a $(1+1)$-dimensional theory with a single real scalar field $\phi$ whose kinematics is modified by a generalizing function $f(\phi)$. After briefly reviewing its Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) structure, we focus on a particular $f(\phi)$ to obtain analytic BPS double-kink solutions in three different models governed by the $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$, and sine-Gordon superpotentials. In all cases, the resulting double-kinks approach the boundaries by following an exponential decay, with the generalizing function controlling its dependence on $x$ and mass. We also calculate the BPS bound explicitly and study how the double kinks behave near the origin. The energy distribution of the novel BPS states engenders symmetric two-lump profiles for the $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon superpotentials. Whereas, for the $\phi^6$ superpotential, the BPS energy profiles form asymmetric two-lumps.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of quantizations of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wang recently constructed a quantization of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy using the Heisenberg vertex algebra. Independently, in joint work with Rossi, we obtained a quantization of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy as the trivial Cohomological Field Theory case of the meromorphic differential hierarchies. In this note, we prove that the two constructions coincide.</description>

      <title>Spectral spacetime-geometry of Womersley flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Womersley solution for pulsatile viscous flow in a circular tube and reconstruct its full time-domain geometry from first principles. By combining harmonic decomposition with exact Bessel solutions, we derive a unified spectral spacetime analytical solution in which the instantaneous relationship between pressure gradient and velocity can be visualized as a loop in phase space. The enclosed loop area is shown to equal the mean hydraulic power per cycle, establishing an exact geometric-energetic identity that holds for arbitrary Womersley number and harmonic composition. We further show that higher harmonic content and increasing Womersley number induce topological transitions in these loops, producing cusps, self-intersections, and curvature hot spots that correspond to inertial-viscous phase dispersion. This framework provides a rigorous baseline for interpreting arterial pressure-flow loops, connecting frequency-domain impedance analysis to measurable time-domain geometry.</description>

      <title>The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlev\'e VI tau functions.</description>
