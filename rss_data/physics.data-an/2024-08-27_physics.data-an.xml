      <title>Mesoscopic Bayesian Inference by Solvable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02869</link>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of data science and artificial intelligence has affected physics in numerous ways, including the application of Bayesian inference, setting the stage for a revolution in research methodology. Our group has proposed Bayesian measurement, a framework that applies Bayesian inference to measurement science with broad applicability across various natural sciences. This framework enables the determination of posterior probability distributions of system parameters, model selection, and the integration of multiple measurement datasets. However, applying Bayesian measurement to real data analysis requires a more sophisticated approach than traditional statistical methods like Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which are designed for an infinite number of measurements $N$. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an analytical theory that explicitly addresses the case where $N$ is finite in the linear regression model. We introduce $O(1)$ mesoscopic variables for $N$ observation noises. Using this mesoscopic theory, we analyze the three core principles of Bayesian measurement: parameter estimation, model selection, and measurement integration. Furthermore, by introducing these mesoscopic variables, we demonstrate that the difference in free energies, critical for both model selection and measurement integration, can be analytically reduced by two mesoscopic variables of $N$ observation noises. This provides a deeper qualitative understanding of model selection and measurement integration and further provides deeper insights into actual measurements for nonlinear models. Our framework presents a novel approach to understanding Bayesian measurement results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Minimally Complex Models with Interactions of Arbitrary Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the model that best describes a high-dimensional dataset is a daunting task, even more so if one aims to consider all possible high-order patterns of the data, going beyond pairwise models. For binary data, we show that this task becomes feasible when restricting the search to a family of simple models, that we call Minimally Complex Models (MCMs). MCMs are maximum entropy models that have interactions of arbitrarily high order grouped into independent components of minimal complexity. They are simple in information-theoretic terms, which means they can only fit well certain types of data patterns and are therefore easy to falsify. We show that Bayesian model selection restricted to these models is computationally feasible and has many advantages. First, the model evidence, which balances goodness-of-fit against complexity, can be computed efficiently without any parameter fitting, enabling very fast explorations of the space of MCMs. Second, the family of MCMs is invariant under gauge transformations, which can be used to develop a representation-independent approach to statistical modeling. For small systems (up to 15 variables), combining these two results allows us to select the best MCM among all, even though the number of models is already extremely large. For larger systems, we propose simple heuristics to find optimal MCMs in reasonable times. Besides, inference and sampling can be performed without any computational effort. Finally, because MCMs have interactions of any order, they can reveal the presence of important high-order dependencies in the data, providing a new approach to explore high-order dependencies in complex systems. We apply our method to synthetic data and real-world examples, illustrating how MCMs portray the structure of dependencies among variables in a simple manner, extracting falsifiable predictions on symmetries and invariance from the data.</description>

      <title>First-principles construction of symmetry-informed quantum metrologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but the optimisation equations involved are often hard to solve. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>
