      <title>If you can distinguish, you can express: Galois theory, Stone--Weierstrass, machine learning, and linguistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay develops a parallel between the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory and the Stone--Weierstrass theorem: both can be viewed as assertions that tie the distinguishing power of a class of objects to their expressive power. We provide an elementary theorem connecting the relevant notions of "distinguishing power". We also discuss machine learning and data science contexts in which these theorems, and more generally the theme of links between distinguishing power and expressive power, appear. Finally, we discuss the same theme in the context of linguistics, where it appears as a foundational principle, and illustrate it with several examples.</description>

      <title>The Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle: A Framework for Navigating Discourses in Mathematics and Its Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature on ethics and sustainability in mathematics and its education is increasingly complex and fragmented, potentially leading to communication breakdowns between different scholarly traditions. To address this, the paper introduces the "Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle," a framework that maps discourses based on their relative concern for three areas (represented as three vertices in the triangle): "Mathematics", "Community", and "Society/Planet". By integrating a systems theoretic perspective, we analyse discourses as dynamic systemic reactions to external irritations. Our analysis reveals that the field's fragmentation can be explained by the "location effect": the phenomenon whereby a discourse's position within the triangle shapes its perception and acceptance of other scholarship. By mapping key discourses and educator archetypes, the framework functions as a meta-heuristic tool. Ultimately, it serves not only to facilitate critical reflection but also as a call for the epistemic humility and dialogue needed to advance the field.</description>

      <title>Gauss and p-adic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his notebooks, Gauss recorded various calculations with "infinite congruences". These infinite congruences are p-adic numbers; Gauss computes a square root of $5$ in the $11$-adic integers in order to find an $11$-adic approximation to a quadratic Gauss sum, computes a nontrivial square root of $1$ in $10$-adic integers, and computes the $10$-adic logarithms of small natural numbers.</description>

      <title>The Amazing Journey of Lars Ahlfors' Fields Medal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the story of the first Fields Medal awarded to Lars Ahlfors. It was smuggled out of Finland in 1944, pawned in Sweden during World War II, and returned to Helsinki in 2004. This article is based on an interview with Ahlfors' second daughter Vanessa Gruen, and established biographical sources.</description>

      <title>An effective analytic recurrence for prime numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Golomb--Keller formula expresses the next prime $p_{n+1}$ as a recurrence relation in terms of the first $n$ primes $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ using the Riemann zeta function and an Euler product, but requires taking a limit as $s \to \infty$, rendering it non-constructive. We transform this asymptotic formula into an effective recurrence by proving that a finite parameter $s \leq p_n$ suffices when combined with the ceiling function, establishing a constructive method valid for all $n \geq 1$.
  The minimal integer parameter $s_n$ (OEIS A389650) reveals deep connections to prime constellations. We prove $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \sigma_n = 0$ unconditionally, where $\sigma_n = s_n/p_n$. The limit superior $C = \limsup \sigma_n$ satisfies $\log \psi \lesssim C \leq 0.4332$, where $\psi \approx 1.46557$ is the supergolden ratio. The lower bound is conditional on the twin prime conjecture; the upper bound is unconditional. The constant $C$ relates to the densest admissible prime constellation, connecting to the Hardy--Littlewood conjectures.
  The method extends to Dirichlet L-functions, yielding other effective formulas for calculating $p_{n+1}$ but also for predicting residues of $p_{n+1}$ modulo any integer with reduced precision requirements.</description>
