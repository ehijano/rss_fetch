      <title>Modelling multiscale architecture of biofilm extracellular matrix and its role in oxygen transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant 'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations during early stage biofilm development.</description>

      <title>Predicting Protein-Nucleic Acid Flexibility Using Persistent Sheaf Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways. Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures, and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as mutation impact analysis and drug design.</description>

      <title>BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</description>

      <title>JAMUN: Bridging Smoothed Molecular Dynamics and Score-Based Learning for Conformational Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on. Our model, code and weights are available at https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.</description>
