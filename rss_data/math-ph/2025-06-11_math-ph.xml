      <title>The Kirkwood closure point process: A solution of the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations for negative activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08242v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians involving rank-one perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the renormalization of a bosonic quadratic Hamiltonian with an ultraviolet divergence. The Hamiltonian is composed of the sum of a free energy and the square of the smeared field operator. We explicitly diagonalize the Hamiltonian via Bogoliubov transformations, and the diagonalized Hamiltonian is easier to study. We show a renormalization of both the energy and the coupling constant depending on the form factor of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Normal Form Power Series for Infinite-Dimensional Lie Pseudo-Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of normal form power series for suitably nonsingular analytic submanifolds under a broad class of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group actions. Our theorem is illustrated by a number of examples, and includes, as a particular case, Chern and Moser's celebrated convergence theorem for normal forms of real hypersurfaces. The construction of normal forms relies on the equivariant moving frame method, while the convergence proof is based on the realization that the normal form can be recovered as part of the solution to an initial value problem for an involutive system of differential equations, whose analyticity is guaranteed by the Cartan-K\"ahler Theorem.</description>

      <title>Operator theoretic measure of causality in linear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Linear Operator Causality Analysis (LOCA), a physics-based framework for analyzing causality in linear dynamical systems, with a focus on fluid mechanics. Unlike data-driven statistical methods like Granger causality, LOCA uses the matrix exponential from the system's governing equations to provide a more rigorous and interpretable measure of causal interactions. Our framework reveals that, under certain conditions, common data-driven measures effectively approximate the squared magnitude of the matrix exponential. LOCA also mitigates common analysis issues, such as misleading inferences from correlated variables. We validate the methodology using a linearized Couette flow, demonstrating its ability to robustly identify both direct and indirect causal relationships between flow structures. This approach offers a powerful tool for understanding modal interactions and perturbation propagation in complex systems.</description>

      <title>The Riemann problem for three-phase foam flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas injection in the context of the three-phase flow in porous media appears in applications such as Enhanced Oil Recovery, aquifer remediation, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). In general, this technique suffers from a difficulty related to excessive gas mobility, which can be circumvented by using foam. This study addresses the non-linear system of differential equations describing the three-phase foam flow based on Corey relative permeability functions. A major obstacle is an umbilic point, where the characteristic wave velocities for different families coincide, complicating the identification of stable wave structures.
  We developed a methodology to solve the Riemann problem describing the three-phase foam displacement in the case when the gas viscosity exceeds that of oil and water. To allow the analysis, we assume foam in local equilibrium (or maximum foam texture), resulting in a constant mobility reduction factor (MRF). These simplifications allowed the classification of possible solutions for the injection of foamed gas and water mixtures under a wide range of initial conditions within the framework of non-classical Conservation Law Theory. As a relevant industrial application of the proposed solution, we investigate the conditions resulting in oil bank formation. Besides improving the general physical understanding of foam flow in a porous medium, this analysis can be applied to calibrate numerical simulators and perform uncertainty quantification. Our analytical estimates were validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Compact Temporal Geometry and the $T^2$ Framework for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional temporal framework in which time is represented by a compact manifold $T^2 = (t_1, t_2)$, with $t_1$ encoding classical causal structure and $t_2$ representing quantum coherence. This construction unifies unitary evolution, decoherence, measurement collapse, and gravitational dynamics within a consistent geometric and algebraic formalism. Compactification of the coherence time $t_2$ yields a minimal temporal resolution $\Delta t_2 \sim \sqrt{\alpha'}$, leading to a discretized spectrum of temporal modes and regularized ultraviolet behavior in quantum field theory and string-theoretic gravity. We formulate an extended Schr\"odinger equation and generalized Lindblad dynamics on $T^2$, and demonstrate the compatibility of this structure with local gauge symmetry through a complexified BRST quantization procedure. Using para-Hermitian geometry and generalized complex structures, we derive a covariant formulation of temporal T-duality that accommodates both Lorentzian and Euclidean signatures. The $T^2$ framework provides new insights into modular thermodynamics, black hole entropy, and the emergence of classical time from quantum coherence, offering a compact and quantized model of temporal geometry rooted in string theory and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>2-Group Symmetries of 3-dimensional Defect TQFTs and Their Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large class of symmetries of topological quantum field theories is naturally described by functors into higher categories of topological defects. Here we study 2-group symmetries of 3-dimensional TQFTs. We explain that these symmetries can be gauged to produce new TQFTs iff certain defects satisfy the axioms of orbifold data. In the special case of Reshetikhin-Turaev theories coming from $G$-crossed braided fusion categories $\mathcal C^\times_G$, we show that there are 0- and 1-form symmetries which have no obstructions to gauging. We prove that gauging the 0-form $G$-symmetry on the neutral component $\mathcal C_e$ of $\mathcal C^\times_G$ produces its equivariantisation $(\mathcal C^\times_G)^G$, which in turn features a generalised symmetry whose gauging recovers $\mathcal C_e$. If $G$ is commutative, the latter symmetry reduces to a 1-form symmetry involving the Pontryagin dual group.</description>

      <title>Delayed Arrow-of-Time Detection in Signed Laplacian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian (with a single linear invariant) and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing R\'enyi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping symmetry, we exhibit a no-signaling example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test. We comment briefly on quantum realizability of our framework.</description>

      <title>Modular resurgence, $q$-Pochhammer symbols, and quantum operators from mirror curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the results of [1,2], we study the resurgence of $q$-Pochhammer symbols and determine their summability and quantum modularity properties. We construct a new, infinite family of pairs of modular resurgent series from the asymptotic expansions of sums of $q$-Pochhammer symbols weighted by suitable Dirichlet characters. These weighted sums fit into the modular resurgence paradigm and provide further evidence supporting our conjectures in [1]. In the context of the topological string/spectral theory correspondence for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, Kashaev and Mari\~no proved that the spectral traces of canonical quantum operators associated with local weighted projective planes can be expressed as sums of $q$-Pochhammer symbols. Exploiting this relation, we show that an exact strong-weak resurgent symmetry, first observed by the second author in [3] and fully formalized in [2] for local $\mathbb{P}^2$, applies to all local $\mathbb{P}^{m,n}$, albeit stripped of some of the underlying number-theoretic properties. Under some assumptions, these properties are restored when considering linear combinations of the spectral traces that reproduce the weighted sums above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends the classical dumbbell (two-bead) model of polymer chains to a more detailed multi-bead representation, where each polymer chain consists of $N$ beads connected by $N-1$ springs. We develop a thermodynamically consistent micro-macro model based on the energy variational method to describe the coupled dynamics of polymer configurations and fluid flow. The resulting framework captures complex microscopic behaviors, such as bond stretching and alignment under flow, and links them to macroscopic stress responses.</description>

      <title>Universality of Photonic Interlacing Architectures for Learning Discrete Linear Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08454v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.</description>

      <title>A Refined Algorithm For the EPR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen~(EPR) model is an analogous model of the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model or the equivalent quantum maximum-cut problem, proposed by R. King two years ago. Adjacent qubits in the model prefer symmetric EPR/Bell parings rather than the antisymmetric one, in order to maximize the energy. Recently, two groups independently develop specific algorithms for the highest-energy state with approximation ratio $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\approx.809$, based on maximum fractional matchings. Here we try to refine one of the two algorithms by devising homogeneous/quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, with the aim to distribute quantum entanglement as much as possible. For regular graphs $G_d$, we immediately obtain increasing approximation ratios $r_d$ with $r_2=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{6}\approx.872$. For irregular graphs, we show such a refinement could still guarantee nice performance if the fractional matchings are chosen properly.</description>

      <title>KP-PINNs: Kernel Packet Accelerated Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08563v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Gravitational Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the non-Hermitian scattering of gravitational waves is examined, and their behavior at spectral singularities is discussed. We investigate the non-Hermitian properties of gravitational waves through the construction of a transfer matrix. By examining spectral singularity points obtained from the transfer matrix, we explore the behavior of gravitational waves at these spectral singularity points and compare the theoretical results with observed measurements. Our findings demonstrate that the frequency values of gravitational waves measured on Earth at spectral singularity points exhibit perfect agreement with the corresponding Hubble constant values. This alignment underscores the significance of the non-Hermitian characteristics of gravitational waves. We anticipate that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of non-Hermitian phenomena in gravitational physics and provide a foundation for future studies in the field.</description>

      <title>Superconformal Weight Shifting Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing superconformal blocks for correlators of general supermultiplets in theories with $SU(m,m|2n)$ symmetry, such as four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}\!=\!2$ and $\mathcal{N} \!=\! 4$ conformal theories. We use analytic superspace, viewed as the super-Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(m|n,2m|2n)$, which includes 4D Minkowski space ($m=2,n=0$). In this formalism, superblocks for non-half-BPS correlators are analogous to non-supersymmetric conformal blocks for correlators of fields with spin. We construct $SU(m,m|2n)$-covariant differential operators which generalise the existing conformal weight-shifting operators, and thus allow us to derive all superconformal blocks from the known half-BPS blocks. Our results provide a framework from which to advance the conformal bootstrap in 4D supersymmetric settings, with potential extensions to lower and higher-dimensional SCFTs. The Grassmannian formalism is also seen to offer a natural and often simpler alternative to the embedding space formalism of non-supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every unitary positive energy representation W of the Virasoro algebra exponentiates to a holomorphic *-representation of the semigroup of annuli by bounded operators on the Hilbert space completion of W. We use this to show that every representation of the Virasoro conformal net also carries a representation of the semigroup of annuli of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Khovanov-Rozansky cycle calculus for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite calculus is a direct generalization of Kauffman planar expansion from $N=2$ to arbitrary $N$, applicable to the restricted class of knots which are entirely made of antiparallel lock tangles. Whenever applicable, it allows a straightforward generalization of the Khovanov calculus without a need of the technically complicated matrix factorization used for arbitrary $N$ in the Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) approach. The main object here is the $3^{n}$-dimensional hypercube with $n$ being the number of bipartite vertices. Maps, differentials, complex and Poincar\'e polynomials are straightforward and indeed reproduce the Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials in the known cases. This provides a great simplification of the Khovanov-Rozansky calculus on the bipartite locus, what can make it an accessible tool for the study of superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <title>Chiral non-Abelian domain walls in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study chiral non-Abelian domain walls in a phase of unconventional vacua of dense QCD. The phase is characterized by asymmetric vacuum-expectation values (VEVs), for example with the left scalar field, corresponding to the left quark-quark condensate, having a nonvanishing VEV and the right field having a vanishing one. The domain wall soliton interpolates between this vacuum and another where the left and right scalar fields switch roles. We contemplate that such vacua could possibly be generated non-perturbatively at very high densities in QCD. Using a strong-coupling, or sigma-model limit, we are able to reduce the full dynamical complex matrix valued equations of motion to the sine-Gordon, a generalization of the sine-Gordon and a generalization of the double sine-Gordon equations. In this limit, we prove nonexistence of domain walls in one of the vacua studied here and we find full numerical computations to converge to the sigma-model limit for many cases, with some exceptions that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates for Dirac Operators in dimension four with obstructions at threshold energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $L^1\to L^\infty$ dispersive estimates for the Dirac equation with a potential in four spatial dimensions. We classify the structure of the obstructions at the thresholds as being composed of an at most two dimensional space of resonances per threshold, and finitely many eigenfunctions. Similar to the Schr\"odinger evolution, we prove the natural $t^{-2}$ decay rate when the thresholds are regular. When there is a threshold resonance or eigenvalue, we show that there is a time dependent, finite rank operator satisfying $\|F_t\|_{L^1\to L^\infty}\lesssim (\log t)^{-1}$ for $t&gt;2$ such that $$
  \|e^{it\mathcal H}P(\mathcal H)-F_t\|_{L^1\to L^\infty}\lesssim t^{-1} \quad \text{for } t&gt;2, $$ with $P$ a projection onto a subspace of the absolutely continuous spectrum in a small neighborhood of the thresholds. We further show that the operator $F_t=0$ if there is a threshold eigenvalue but no threshold resonance. We pair this with high energy bounds for the evolution and provide a complete description of the dispersive bounds.</description>

      <title>Packing3D: An Open-Source Analytical Framework for Computing Packing Density and Mixing Indices Using Partial Spherical Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08852v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurement of packing density. We introduce Packing3D, an open-source Julia package providing analytic, partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. Our goals were to (1) eliminate boundary-artifact jumps, (2) maintain high throughput on large datasets, and (3) deliver standard mixing metrics via a unified API. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. A short-circuit bounding-sphere test shortens computations: fully inside or outside spheres are handled in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and only near-boundary spheres invoke the analytic kernels. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. Packing3D converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and processes up to $10^8$ sphere-cell intersections per second in single-threaded Julia with linear scaling in particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). Packing3D provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.

      <title>Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave solutions, periodic and superposition solutions to the system of first-order (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq's equations derived from the Euler equations for an ideal fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article concludes the study of (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear wave equations that can be derived in a model of an ideal fluid with irrotational motion. In the considered case of identical scaling of the $x,y$ variables, obtaining a (2+1)-dimensional wave equation analogous to the KdV equation is impossible. Instead, from a system of two first-order Boussinesq equations, a non-linear wave equation for the auxiliary function $f(x,y,z)$ defining the velocity potential can be obtained, and only from its solutions can the surface wave form $\eta(x,y,z)$ be obtained. We demonstrate the existence of families of (2+1)-dimensional traveling wave solutions, including solitary and periodic solutions, of both cnoidal and superposition types.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Optical Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, in the full vector formulation of electromagnetic fields, that the well-known optical theorem pertinent for the characterization of a scatterer's extinction power and associated cross section can be expressed in a multitude of alternative equivalent forms. These alternatives involve different forms of projective field measurements or detectors. The inherent nonuniqueness of such optical-theorem-based detectors stems from the nonuniqueness of an associated inverse source problem, and can be interpreted via well-known equivalence principles. Some of the multiple ways in which the extinction of power due to the interaction of a scattering body with a probing field can be measured remotely are derived and interpreted for a number of canonical frameworks. This includes detectors and their corresponding optical theorems synthesized in the contexts of surface-confined sensors for near-field sensing, surface sensors based on backpropagation-based imaging, a number of planar aperture realizations dealt with through classical diffraction theory, as well as detectors based on multipole representations. General aspects of the derived optical theorems are discussed in the context of envisioned practical applications.</description>

      <title>One loop corrections to the thermodynamics of near-extremal Kerr-(A)dS black holes from Heun equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute one-loop corrections to the euclidean gravitational path integral of near-extremal (anti-)de Sitter-Kerr black hole in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun equation describing the black hole linear perturbations in the Teukolsky formalism. We show that different near-extremal limits lead to distinct physical properties of the gravitational configuration, as they get described by distinct limiting differential equations. As a result, the light modes emerging in the limit determine different scaling properties in the temperature of the one-loop determinants. We show that the cold case displays distinctive universal log(T) corrections to the entropy of the system, including the ultracold regime. On the contrary, these do not appear in the limit in which the event horizon superimposes onto the cosmological one. In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, a further check is performed by comparison with the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev formula.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with slowly-varying envelope (parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure, and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Character Expansion and the Harer-Zagier Transform of Knot Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that statistical mechanical solvable models give knot polynomials. The HOMFLY-PT polynomial is a two-parameter knot polynomial that admits a character expansion, expressed as a sum of Schur functions over Young tableaux. The Harer-Zagier transform (HZ), which converts the HOMFLY-PT polynomial into a rational polynomial in $q$ and $\lambda$, can also be expanded in terms of the HZ of characters. When the HZ of a knot is fully factorisable, such an expansion consists of Young diagrams of hook shape. However, for the vast majority of knots and links the HZ is not factorisable. We show that, in non-factorised cases with up to 7-strands, the HZ transform can be decomposed into a sum of factorised terms. Furthermore, by the substitution $\lambda= q^\mu$ for a magic number $\mu$, the HZ can be reduced to a simple rational function in $q$ consisting of products of cyclotomic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Deformation of Geometry through Function C(v): Scalar Deformation Flow and the Geometric Classification of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar deformation function C(v), which captures how local geometric structures respond to motion at velocity v. This function exhibits smooth analytic behavior and defines a critical velocity vc beyond which the geometry compresses. Extending C(v) into a flow C(v, tau), we construct a scalar analogue of Ricci flow that governs the evolution of geometric configurations toward symmetric, stable states without singularities. The flow is derived from a variational energy functional and satisfies global existence and convergence properties. We show that this scalar evolution provides a pathway for topological classification of three-manifolds through conformal smoothing and energy minimization, offering a curvature-free geometric mechanism rooted in analytic deformation. The resulting framework combines techniques from differential geometry and dynamical systems and may serve as a minimal geometric model for structure formation in relativistic contexts.</description>

Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of Lorentzian conformal structures on the canonical circle bundle of a partially integrable contact almost Cauchy-Riemann manifold. This builds on previous work by Leitner, who generalised Fefferman's construction associated to a CR manifold to the non-involutive case. We provide characterisations of these conformal structures and show that they admit distinguished pure spinor fields. We introduce exact 'perturbations' of such Fefferman spaces by a semi-basic one-form, which can be suitably interpreted as a tuple of weighted tensors on the almost CR manifold. The resulting perturbed conformal space is an instance of a so-called nearly Robinson manifold introduced recently by Fino, Leistner and the present author. We investigate the existence of metrics in these conformal classes which satisfy appropriate subsystems of the Einstein equations. These metrics are defined only off cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in terms of almost Lorentzian densities, which include Gover's almost Einstein scales as a special case. In particular, in dimensions greater than four, almost Einstein scales always arise from so-called CR-Einstein structures, almost CR analogues of Einstein metrics. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a perturbed Fefferman space to be conformally flat on the zero set of an almost Einstein scale. We construct an explicit example of a CR-Einstein structure on a strictly almost CR five-manifold based on a strictly almost Kaehler-Einstein four-manifold due to Nurowski and Przanowski.</description>

      <title>On antiferromagnetic regimes in the Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ashkin-Teller model can be represented by a pair $(\tau,\tau')$ of Ising spin configurations with coupling constants $J$ and $J'$ for each, and $U$ for their product. We study this representation on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 2$. We confirm the presence of a partial antiferromagnetic phase in the isotropic case ($J=J'$) when $-U&gt;0$ is sufficiently large and $J=J'&gt;0$ is sufficiently small, by means of a graphical representation. In this phase, $\tau$ is disordered, admitting exponential decay of correlations, while the product $\tau\tau'$ is antiferromagnetically ordered, which is to say that correlations are bounded away from zero but alternate in sign. No correlation inequalities are available in this part of the phase diagram. In the planar case $d=2$, we construct a coupling with the six-vertex model and show, in analogy to the first result, that the corresponding height function is localised, although with antiferromagnetically ordered heights on one class of vertices of the graph.
  We then return to $d\geq 2$ and consider a part of the phase diagram where $U&lt;0$ but where correlation inequalities still apply. Using the OSSS inequality, we proceed to establish a subcritical sharpness statement along suitable curves covering this part, circumventing the difficulty of the lack of general monotonicity properties in the parameters. We then address the isotropic case and provide indications of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. We show that for Lie groupoids, the additional adjustment data amounts to a Cartan connection. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <title>Efficient Multiparty Entanglement Distribution with DODAG-X Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the DODAG-X protocol for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource consumption and enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a variation on the X-protocol within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification and path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead when compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our benchmarks on grid lattice and small-world topologies reveal substantial measurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the success of DODAG-X for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary networks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic $n$-party entanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution for entanglement routing, advancing current techniques for reliable quantum communication and network applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product CFTs and One-Character Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-character CFTs obtained as one-character extensions of the tensor products of a single CFT $\mathcal{C}$. The motivation comes from the fact that $28$ of the $71$ CFTs in the Schelleken's list of $c = 24$ CFTs are such CFTs. We study for $\mathcal{C}$ : (i) any two-character WZW CFT with vanishing Wronskian index, (ii) the Ising CFT, (iii) the infinite class of $D_{r,1}$ CFTs and the $A_{4,1}$ CFT. The characters being $S$-invariant homogenous polynomials of the characters of $\mathcal{C}$, when organised in terms of a $S$-invariant basis, take compact forms allowing for closed form answers for high central charges. We find a $S$-invariant basis for each of the CFTs studied. As an example, one can find an explicit expression for the character of the monster CFT as a degree-$48$ polynomial of the characters of the Ising CFT. In some CFTs, some of the $S$-invariant polynomials of characters compute, after using the $q$-series of the characters, to a constant value. Hence, the characters of one-character extensions are more properly elements of the quotient ring of polynomials (of characters) with the ideal needed for the quotient, generated by $S$-invariant polynomials that compute to a constant. In some cases, we are able to rule out the existence of one-character extension CFTs. In other cases, we predict their existence. We are able to conjecture a discrete set of six and four infinite series of one-character extension CFTs.</description>

      <title>On the localization length of finite-volume random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs) in dimensions 1 and 2, which naturally extend the Anderson model by replacing the random potential with a random block potential. Specifically, we focus on two RBSOs -- the block Anderson and Wegner orbital models -- defined on the $d$-dimensional torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$. They take the form $H=V + \lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a block potential with i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ Gaussian diagonal blocks, $\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We normalize the blocks of $\Psi$ so that each block has a Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the same order as the blocks of $V$. Assuming $W\ge L^\delta$ for a small constant $\delta&gt;0$ and $\lambda\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish the following results. In dimension $d=2$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors. Combined with the localization result from arXiv:1608.02922, which holds under the condition $\lambda\ll W^{-d/2}$, this provides a rigorous proof of the Anderson localization-delocalization transition as $\lambda$ crosses the critical threshold $W^{-d/2}$. In dimension $d=1$, we show that the localization length of bulk eigenvectors is at least of order $(W\lambda)^2$, which is believed to be the correct scaling.</description>

      <title>Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the semiclassical asymptotics of the Martinet sub-Laplacian on the flat toroidal cylinder $M = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^2$. We describe the asymptotic distribution of sequences of eigenfunctions oscillating at different scales prefixed by Rothschild-Stein estimates via the introduction of adapted two-microlocal semiclassical measures. We obtain concentration and invariance properties of these measures in terms of effective dynamics governed by harmonic or an-harmonic oscillators depending on the regime, and we show additional regularity properties with respect to critical points of the eigenvalues of the Montgomery family of quartic oscillators.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>
