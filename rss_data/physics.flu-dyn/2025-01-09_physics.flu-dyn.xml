      <title>Results from Particle-Resolved Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some of the results obtained to date with the aid of the PR-DNS approach to turbulent particulate flows. It is shown that the method has matured to a point which allows to apply it successfully to a wide variety of fluid/particle configurations, albeit still at a relatively large computational cost. Due to the availability of high-fidelity space-and-time-resolved data, a number of challenging open questions have already been addressed in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Biglobal resolvent analysis of separated flow over a NACA0012 airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of Reynolds number across $Re=1000$, $2500$, $5000$, and $10000$ on separated flow over a two-dimensional NACA0012 airfoil at an angle of attack of $\alpha=14^\circ$ are investigated through the biglobal resolvent analysis. We identify modal structures and energy amplifications over a range of frequency, spanwise wavenumber, and discount parameter, providing insights across various timescales. Using temporal discounting, we find that the shear layer dynamics dominates over short time horizons, while the wake dynamics becomes the primary amplification mechanism over long time horizons. Spanwise effects also appear over long time horizon, sustained by low frequencies. At a fixed timescale, we investigate the influence of Reynolds number on response and forcing mode structures, as well as the energy gain over different frequencies. Across all Reynolds numbers, the response modes shift from wake-dominated structures at low frequencies to shear layer-dominated structures at higher frequencies. The frequency at which the dominant mechanism changes is independent of the Reynolds number. The response mode structures show similarities across different Reynolds numbers, with local streamwise wavelengths only depending on frequency. Comparisons at a different angle of attack ($\alpha=9^\circ$) show that the transition from wake to shear layer dynamics with increasing frequency only occurs if the unsteady flow is three-dimensional. We also study the dominant frequencies associated with wake and shear layer dynamics across the angles of attack and Reynolds numbers, and present the characteristic scaling for each mechanism.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven dynamics of a ludion in a stratified fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by bouncing drop experiments that revealed how macroscopic systems can exhibit wave-particle properties akin to quantum systems, we explore here a new wave-particle system based on internal gravity waves propagating in a density-stratified fluid. Recent experiments on oscillating particles (called "ludions") in a density-stratified fluid have shown that fluid-particle interactions lead to a symmetry breaking, resulting in the particle self-locomotion in the horizontal plane. Here, we show using 2D numerical simulations that this symmetry breaking is driven by a Doppler-effect force, which we also predict analytically using a minimal theoretical model.In wall-bounded domains, this Doppler force interacts with a Casimir-like potential rapidly developing due to wave reflection on the distant walls. Despite the Doppler force, this potential captures the ludion trajectories in fixed points or chaotic attractors located at or around the potential wells. We finally propose a minimal dynamical model recapitulating the main aspects of the ludion dynamics. Our work introduces the ludion as a new promising system for the exploration of macroscopic wave-particle duality.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-Like Formalism for Immiscible and Incompressible Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is possible to formulate immiscible and incompressible two-phase flow in porous media in a mathematical framework resembling thermodynamics based on the Jaynes generalization of statistical mechanics. We review this approach and discuss the meaning of the emergent variables that appear, agiture, flow derivative and flow pressure, which are conjugate to the configurational entropy, the saturation and the porosity respectively. We conjecture that the agiture, the temperature-like variable, is directly related to the pressure gradient. This has as a consequence that the configurational entropy, a measure of how the fluids are distributed within the porous media and the accompanying velocity field, and the mobility of the fluids are related. We also develop elements of another version of the thermodynamics-like formalism where fractional flow rather than saturation is the control variable, since this is typically the natural control variable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Optical Coherence Tomography in Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become an indispensable tool for investigating mesoscopic features in soft matter and fluid mechanics. Its ability to provide high-resolution, non-invasive measurements in both spatial and temporal domains bridges critical gaps in experimental instrumentation, enabling the study of complex, confined, and dynamic systems. This review serves as both an introduction to OCT and a practical guide for researchers seeking to adopt this technology. A set of tutorials, complemented by Python scripts, are provided for both intensity- and Doppler-based techniques. The versatility of OCT is illustrated through case studies, including time-resolved velocimetry, particle-based velocity measurements, slip velocity characterization, detection of shear-induced structures, and analysis of fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interactions. Drawing on our experiences, we also present a set of practical guidelines for avoiding common pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Motion and hydrodynamic resistance of an elastic bead confined in a square microchannel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulation reveals supercritical bifurcation in flow mode transitions of power-law fluids in the four-roll mill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-roll mill has been traditionally viewed as a device generating simple extensional flow with a central stagnation point. Our systematic investigation using a two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann (TRT-RLB) model reveals unexpected richness in the flow physics, identifying two previously unreported supercritical bifurcation modes: a quadrifoliate vortex mode featuring four symmetrical counter-rotating vortices, and a dumbbell-shaped quad-vortex mode where vortices detach from but remain symmetric about the stagnation point. The numerical framework, representing the first successful extension of TRT-RLB method to power-law fluid dynamics, enables comprehensive mapping of flow characteristics across Reynolds numbers ($1 \leq Re \leq 50$), power-law indices ($0.7 \leq n \leq 1.3$), and geometric configurations. The transition from quadrifoliate vortex mode exhibits distinct pathways depending on the power-law index: at relatively small $n$, the flow undergoes a direct supercritical bifurcation to simple extensional flow, while at relatively large $n$, it evolves through an intermediate dumbbell-shaped state. Among geometric parameters, the roller radius $r$ emerges as the dominant factor controlling bifurcation points and vortex dimensions, whereas the roller-container gap $\delta$ exerts minimal influence on flow regimes. The transitions between flow modes can be precisely characterized through the evolution of vortex dimensions and velocity gradients at the stagnation point, providing quantitative criteria for flow regime identification. These findings enrich our fundamental understanding of bifurcation phenomena in extensional devices and provide quantitative guidelines for achieving desired flow patterns in four-roll mill applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discovery of Fundamental Physical Laws: Learning Magnetohydrodynamics from 3D Turbulence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of dynamical models from data represents a crucial step in advancing our understanding of physical systems. Library-based sparse regression has emerged as a powerful method for inferring governing equations directly from spatiotemporal data, but current model-agnostic implementations remain computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to data that lack substantial complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable framework that enables efficient discovery of complex dynamical models across a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, by ``discovering'' the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from synthetic data generated by high-resolution simulations of turbulent MHD flows with viscous and Ohmic dissipation. Using a library of candidate terms that is $\gtrsim 10$ times larger than those in previous studies, we accurately recover the full set of MHD equations, including the subtle dissipative terms that are critical to the dynamics of the system. Our results establish sparse regression as a practical tool for uncovering fundamental physical laws from complex, high-dimensional data without assumptions on the underlying symmetry or the form of any governing equation.</description>

      <title>DeepVIVONet: Using deep neural operators to optimize sensor locations with application to vortex-induced vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DeepVIVONet, a new framework for optimal dynamic reconstruction and forecasting of the vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a marine riser, using field data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepVIVONet in accurately reconstructing the motion of an off--shore marine riser by using sparse spatio-temporal measurements. We also show the generalization of our model in extrapolating to other flow conditions via transfer learning, underscoring its potential to streamline operational efficiency and enhance predictive accuracy. The trained DeepVIVONet serves as a fast and accurate surrogate model for the marine riser, which we use in an outer--loop optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal locations for placing the sensors. Furthermore, we employ an existing sensor placement method based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to compare with our data-driven approach. We find that that while POD offers a good approach for initial sensor placement, DeepVIVONet's adaptive capabilities yield more precise and cost-effective configurations.</description>

      <title>Active learning of data-assimilation closures using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of machine learning techniques coupled with the availability of high-quality experimental and numerical data has significantly advanced numerous applications in fluid mechanics. Notable among these are the development of data assimilation and closure models for unsteady and turbulent flows employing neural networks (NN). Despite their widespread use, these methods often suffer from overfitting and typically require extensive datasets, particularly when not incorporating physical constraints. This becomes compelling in the context of numerical simulations, where, given the high computational costs, it is crucial to establish learning procedures that are effective even with a limited dataset. Here, we tackle those limitations by developing NN models capable of generalizing over unseen data in low-data limit by: i) incorporating invariances into the NN model using a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) architecture; and ii) devising an adaptive strategy for the selection of the data utilized in the learning process. GNNs are particularly well-suited for numerical simulations involving unstructured domain discretization and we demonstrate their use by interfacing them with a Finite Elements (FEM) solver for the supervised learning of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. We consider as a test-case the data-assimilation of meanflows past generic bluff bodies, at different Reynolds numbers 50&gt;=Re&gt;=150, characterized by an unsteady dynamics. We show that the GNN models successfully predict the closure term; remarkably, these performances are achieved using a very limited dataset selected through an active learning process ensuring the generalization properties of the RANS closure term. The results suggest that GNN models trained through active learning procedures are a valid alternative to less flexible techniques such as convolutional NN.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Immersed Boundaries via Volume Penalization in the Industrial Aeronautical Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver CODA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation and validation of an immersed boundary volume penalization method in the computational fluid dynamics solver CODA (from ONERA, DLR, and Airbus). Our goal is to model and simulate turbulent fluid flows in complex 3D aerodynamic configurations through the numerical solution of the Reynolds--averaged Navier--Stokes equations using the Spalart--Allmaras turbulent model. To do that, an immersed boundary method has been implemented in CODA and an efficient preprocessing tool for the construction of unstructured hexahedral meshes with adaptive mesh refinement around immersed geometries has been developed. We report several numerical examples, including subsonic flow past the NACA0012 airfoil, transonic flow past the RAE2822 airfoil, subsonic flow past the MDA30P30N multi-element airfoil, and subsonic flow around the NASA high-lift CRM aircraft. These simulations have been performed in the CODA solver with a second-order finite volume scheme as spatial discretization and an implicit backward Euler scheme based on the matrix-free GMRES block-Jacobi iterative method. The reported numerical simulations are in good agreement with their corresponding experimental data. These encouraging results allow us to conclude that the implemented immersed boundary method is efficient, flexible, and accurate and can therefore be used for aeronautical applications in industry.</description>

      <title>A Universal Relation Between Intermittency and Dissipation in Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between fundamental quantities of turbulent flows like the dissipation constant $C_\varepsilon$ and the intermittency factor $\mu$, expected to be constant for homogeneous isotropic turbulence, is explored with respect to their relationship for a wider class of non-ideal turbulent flows. For the energy cascade, $C_\varepsilon$ is known to reflect its basic overall properties, while $\mu$ quantifies the emerging intermittency down the cascade. Using a very large dataset of turbulent wakes, grid-generated turbulence and an axisymmetric jet, we find that $\mu$ is inversely proportional to $C_\varepsilon$, providing a new empirical principle</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Strategy for Improving Aortic Blood Flow Simulations with Boundary Control and Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding time-dependent blood flow dynamics in arteries is crucial for diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases. However, accurately predicting time-varying flow patterns requires integrating observational data with computational models in a dynamic environment. This study investigates the application of data assimilation and boundary optimization techniques to improve the accuracy of time-dependent blood flow simulations. We propose an integrated approach that combines data assimilation methods with boundary optimization strategies tailored for time-dependent cases. Our method aims to minimize the disparity between model predictions and observed data over time, thereby enhancing the fidelity of time-dependent blood flow simulations. Using synthetic time-series observational data with added noise, we validate our approach by comparing its predictions with the known exact solution, computing the L2 norm to demonstrate improved accuracy in time-dependent blood flow simulations. Our results indicate that the optimization process consistently aligns the optimized data with the exact data. In particular, velocity magnitudes showed reduced discrepancies compared to the noisy data, aligning more closely with the exact solutions. The analysis of pressure data revealed a remarkable correspondence between the optimized and exact pressure values, highlighting the potential of this methodology for accurate pressure estimation without any previous knowledge on this quantity. Furthermore, wall shear stress (WSS) analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of our optimization scheme in reducing noise and improving prediction of a relevant indicator determined at the postprocessing level. These findings suggest that our approach can significantly enhance the accuracy of blood flow simulations, ultimately contributing to better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Consistent Interface Capturing Adaptive Reconstruction Approach for Viscous Compressible Multicomponent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes a physically consistent numerical discretization approach for simulating viscous compressible multicomponent flows. It has two main contributions. First, a contact discontinuity (and material interface) detector is developed. In those regions of contact discontinuities, the THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) approach is used for reconstructing appropriate variables (phasic densities). For other flow regions, the variables are reconstructed using the Monotonicity-preserving (MP) scheme (or Weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme (WENO)). For reconstruction in the characteristic space, the THINC approach is used only for the contact (or entropy) wave and volume fractions and for the reconstruction of primitive variables, the THINC approach is used for phasic densities and volume fractions only, offering an effective solution for reducing dissipation errors near contact discontinuities. The second contribution is the development of an algorithm that uses a central reconstruction scheme for the tangential velocities, as they are continuous across material interfaces in viscous flows. In this regard, the Ducros sensor (a shock detector that cannot detect material interfaces) is employed to compute the tangential velocities using a central scheme across material interfaces. Using the central scheme does not produce any oscillations at the material interface. The proposed approach is thoroughly validated with several benchmark test cases for compressible multicomponent flows, highlighting its advantages. The numerical results of the benchmark tests show that the proposed method captured the material interface sharply compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility and accuracy of a machine learning model to predict the dynamics of a gas pocket that is formed when a breaking wave impacts on a solid wall. The proposed ML model is based on the convolutional long short-term memory structure and is trained with experimental data. In particular, it takes as input two high-speed camera snapshots before impact and produces as output six scalars that describe the dynamics of the gas pocket. The experiments are performed in a wave flume, where we use solitons -- in combination with a bathymetry profile -- to generate wave breaking close to a solid wall which is instrumented with dynamic pressure sensors. By varying the water depth $h_\ell$ and the parameter $\alpha = A/h_\ell$, where $A$ is the soliton wave amplitude, we are able to generate a family of unique breaking waves with different gas pocket sizes and wave kinematics. In this so-called phase space of wave generation ($h_\ell$, $\alpha$), we perform experiments on 67 different wave states that form our dataset. Experimentally, we find that the frequency of oscillation of the gas pocket can be attributed to the initial volume of gas plus a geometric correction and that the maximum and minimum pressures are qualitatively well captured by the one-dimensional Bagnold model. In terms of the ML model, we compare its performance to the experimental data and find that the model quantitatively reproduces the trends found in the experiments -- in particular for the maximum and minimum pressure in the gas pocket and the frequency of oscillation.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic cavitation threshold charts are used to map between acoustic parameters (mainly intensity and frequency) and different regimes of acoustic cavitation. The two main regimes are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations without collapse. The cavitation charts strongly depend on the physical model used to compute the bubble dynamics and the algorithm for classifying the cavitation threshold. The differences between modeling approaches become especially noticeable for resonant bubbles and when sonication parameters result in large-amplitude oscillations. This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates three physical models, i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis and Gilmore equations, and multiple cavitation classification techniques. Specifically, we classify the cavitation regimes based on the maximum radius, the acoustic Mach number, the kurtosis factor of acoustic emissions, and the Flynn criterion on the inertial and pressure functions. Four machine learning strategies were developed to predict the likelihood of the transient and stable cavitation, using equally weighted contributions from classification techniques. By solving the differential equations for bubble dynamics across a range of sonication and material parameters and applying cross-validation on held-out test data, our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for cavitation regimes. This physics-informed machine-learning approach offers probabilistic insights into cavitation likelihood, combining diverse physical models and classification strategies, each contributing different levels of physical rigor and interpretability.</description>
