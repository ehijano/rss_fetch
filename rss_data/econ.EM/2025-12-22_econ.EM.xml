      <title>Principled Identification of Structural Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a new perspective on identification in structural dynamic models: rather than imposing restrictions, we optimize an objective. This provides new theoretical insights into traditional Cholesky identification. A correlation-maximizing objective yields an Order- and Scale-Invariant Identification Scheme (OASIS) that selects the orthogonal rotation that best aligns structural shocks with their reduced-form innovations. We revisit a large number of SVAR studies and find, across 22 published SVARs, that the correlations between structural and reduced-form shocks are generally high.</description>

      <title>Back to Feedback: Dynamics and Heterogeneity in Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many popular estimation methods in panel data rely on the assumption that the covariates of interest are strictly exogenous. However, this assumption is empirically restrictive in a wide range of settings. In this paper I argue that credible empirical work requires meaningfully relaxing strict exogeneity assumptions. Econometricians have developed methods that allow for sequential exogeneity, which in contrast with strict exogeneity allows for the presence of feedback from past outcomes to future covariates or treatments. I review some of the classic work on linear models with constant coefficients, and then describe some approaches that allow for coefficient heterogeneity in models with feedback. Finally, in the last two parts of the paper I review recent work that allows for sequential exogeneity in nonlinear panel data models, and mention possible extensions to network settings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Inference for Rank Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are widely used tools for measuring dependence. Surprisingly, when it comes to asymptotic inference for these rank correlations, some fundamental results and methods have not yet been developed, in particular for discrete random variables and in the time series case, and concerning variance estimation in general. Consequently, asymptotic confidence intervals are not available. We provide a comprehensive treatment of asymptotic inference for classical rank correlations, including Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, Goodman-Kruskal's gamma, Kendall's tau-b, and grade correlation. We derive asymptotic distributions for both iid and time series data, resorting to asymptotic results for U-statistics, and introduce consistent variance estimators. This enables the construction of confidence intervals and tests, generalizes classical results for continuous random variables and leads to corrected versions of widely used tests of independence. We analyze the finite-sample performance of our variance estimators, confidence intervals, and tests in simulations and illustrate their use in case studies.</description>

      <title>Layer-2 Adoption and Ethereum Mainnet Congestion: Regime-Aware Causal Evidence Across London, the Merge, and Dencun (2021-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Do Ethereum's Layer-2 (L2) rollups actually decongest the Layer-1 (L1) mainnet once protocol upgrades and demand are held constant? Using a 1245-day daily panel from August 5, 2021 to December 31, 2024 that spans the London, Merge, and Dencun upgrades, we link Ethereum fee and congestion metrics to L2 user activity, macro-demand proxies, and targeted event indicators. We estimate a regime-aware error-correction model that treats posting-clean L2 user share as a continuous treatment. Over the pre-Dencun (London+Merge) window, a 10 percentage point increase in L2 adoption lowers median base fees by about 13% -- roughly 5 Gwei at pre-Dencun levels -- and deviations from the long-run relation decay with an 11-day half-life. Block utilization and a scarcity index show similar congestion relief. After Dencun, L2 adoption is already high and treatment support narrows, so blob-era estimates are statistically imprecise and we treat them as exploratory. The pre-Dencun window therefore delivers the first cross-regime causal estimate of how aggregate L2 adoption decongests Ethereum, together with a reusable template for monitoring rollup-centric scaling strategies.</description>

      <title>Sharp Structure-Agnostic Lower Bounds for General Functional Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of efficient nonparametric estimators has long been a central problem in statistics, machine learning, and decision making. Classical optimal procedures often rely on strong structural assumptions, which can be misspecified in practice and complicate deployment. This limitation has sparked growing interest in structure-agnostic approaches -- methods that debias black-box nuisance estimates without imposing structural priors. Understanding the fundamental limits of these methods is therefore crucial. This paper provides a systematic investigation of the optimal error rates achievable by structure-agnostic estimators. We first show that, for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE), a central parameter in causal inference, doubly robust learning attains optimal structure-agnostic error rates. We then extend our analysis to a general class of functionals that depend on unknown nuisance functions and establish the structure-agnostic optimality of debiased/double machine learning (DML). We distinguish two regimes -- one where double robustness is attainable and one where it is not -- leading to different optimal rates for first-order debiasing, and show that DML is optimal in both regimes. Finally, we instantiate our general lower bounds by deriving explicit optimal rates that recover existing results and extend to additional estimands of interest. Our results provide theoretical validation for widely used first-order debiasing methods and guidance for practitioners seeking optimal approaches in the absence of structural assumptions. This paper generalizes and subsumes the ATE lower bound established in \citet{jin2024structure} by the same authors.</description>
