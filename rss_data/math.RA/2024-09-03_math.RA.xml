      <title>Monoids, dynamics and Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leavitt path algebras, which are algebras associated to directed graphs, were first introduced about 20 years ago. They have strong connections to such topics as symbolic dynamics, operator algebras, non-commutative geometry, representation theory, and even chip firing. In this article we invite the reader to sneak a peek at these fascinating algebras and their interplay with several seemingly disparate parts of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Bialgebra theory for nearly associative algebras and $LR$-algebras: equivalence, characterization, and $LR$-Yang-Baxter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the bialgebra theory for two classes of non-associative algebras: nearly associative algebras and $LR$-algebras. In particular, building on recent studies that reveal connections between these algebraic structures, we establish that nearly associative bialgebras and $LR$-bialgebras are, in fact, equivalent concepts. We also provide a characterization of these bialgebra classes based on the coproduct. Moreover, since the development of nearly associative bialgebras - and by extension, $LR$-bialgebras - requires the framework of nearly associative $L$-algebras, we introduce this class of non-associative algebras and explore their fundamental properties. Furthermore, we identify and characterize a special class of nearly associative bialgebras, the coboundary nearly associative bialgebras, which provides a natural framework for studying the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) within this context.</description>

      <title>Quasi-twilled associative algebras, deformation maps and their governing algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-twilled associative algebra is an associative algebra $\mathbb{A}$ whose underlying vector space has a decomposition $\mathbb{A} = A \oplus B$ such that $B \subset \mathbb{A}$ is a subalgebra. In the first part of this paper, we give the Maurer-Cartan characterization and introduce the cohomology of a quasi-twilled associative algebra.
  In a quasi-twilled associative algebra $\mathbb{A}$, a linear map $D: A \rightarrow B$ is called a strong deformation map if $\mathrm{Gr}(D) \subset \mathbb{A}$ is a subalgebra. Such a map generalizes associative algebra homomorphisms, derivations, crossed homomorphisms and the associative analogue of modified {\sf r}-matrices. We introduce the cohomology of a strong deformation map $D$ unifying the cohomologies of all the operators mentioned above. We also define the governing algebra for the pair $(\mathbb{A}, D)$ to study simultaneous deformations of both $\mathbb{A}$ and $D$.
  On the other hand, a linear map $r: B \rightarrow A$ is called a weak deformation map if $\mathrm{Gr} (r) \subset \mathbb{A}$ is a subalgebra. Such a map generalizes relative Rota-Baxter operators of any weight, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators, left-averaging operators and right-averaging operators. Here we define the cohomology and governing algebra of a weak deformation map $r$ (that unify the cohomologies of all the operators mentioned above) and also for the pair $(\mathbb{A}, r)$ that govern simultaneous deformations.</description>

      <title>On Poisson conformal bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a conformal analog of the theory of Poisson bialgebras as well as a bialgebra theory of Poisson conformal algebras. We introduce the notion of Poisson conformal bialgebras, which are characterized by Manin triples of Poisson conformal algebras. A class of special Poisson conformal bialgebras called coboundary Poisson conformal bialgebras are constructed from skew-symmetric solutions of the Poisson conformal Yang-Baxter equation, whose operator forms are studied. Then we show that the semi-classical limits of conformal formal deformations of commutative and cocommutative antisymmetric infinitesimal conformal bialgebras are Poisson conformal bialgebras. Finally, we extend the correspondence between Poisson conformal algebras and Poisson-Gel'fand-Dorfman algebras to the context of bialgebras, that is, we introduce the notion of Poisson-Gel'fand-Dorfman bialgebras and show that Poisson-Gel'fand-Dorfman bialgebras correspond to a class of Poisson conformal bialgebras. Moreover, a construction of Poisson conformal bialgebras from pre-Poisson-Gel'fand-Dorfman algebras is given.</description>

      <title>Cup product, Fr\"{o}licher-Nijenhuis bracket and the derived bracket associated to Hom-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce some new graded Lie algebras associated with a Hom-Lie algebra. At first, we define the cup product bracket and its application to the deformation theory of Hom-Lie algebra morphisms. We observe an action of the well-known Hom-analogue of the Nijenhuis-Richardson graded Lie algebra on the cup product graded Lie algebra. Using the corresponding semidirect product, we define the Fr\"{o}licher-Nijenhuis bracket and study its application to Nijenhuis operators. We show that the Nijenhuis-Richardson graded Lie algebra and the Fr\"{o}licher-Nijenhuis algebra constitute a matched pair of graded Lie algebras. Finally, we define another graded Lie bracket, called the derived bracket that is useful to study Rota-Baxter operators on Hom-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Lie affgebras vis-\`a-vis Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that any Lie affgebra, that is an algebraic system consisting of an affine space together with a bi-affine bracket satisfying affine versions of the antisymmetry and Jacobi identity, is isomorphic to a Lie algebra together with an element and a specific generalised derivation (in the sense of Leger and Luks, [G.F.\ Leger \&amp; E.M.\ Luks, Generalized derivations of Lie algebras, {\em J.\ Algebra} {\bf 228} (2000), 165--203]). These Lie algebraic data can be taken for the construction of a Lie affgebra or, conversely, they can be uniquely derived for any Lie algebra fibre of the Lie affgebra. The close relationship between Lie affgebras and (enriched by the additional data) Lie algebras can be employed to attempt a classification of the former by the latter. In particular, up to isomorphism, a complex Lie affgebra with a simple Lie algebra fibre $\mathfrak{g}$ is fully determined by a scalar and an element of $\mathfrak{g}$ fixed up to an automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}$, and it can be universally embedded in a trivial extension of $\mathfrak{g}$ by a derivation. The study is illustrated by a number of examples that include all Lie affgebras with one-dimensional, nonabelian two-dimensional, $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}(2,\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3)$ fibres. Extensions of Lie affgebras by cocycles and their relation to cocycle extensions of tangent Lie algebras is briefly discussed too.</description>

      <title>Extended Karpenko and Karpenko-Merkurjev theorems for quasilinear quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $q$ be anisotropic quasilinear quadratic forms over a field $F$ of characteristic $2$, and let $i$ be the isotropy index of $q$ after scalar extension to the function field of the affine quadric with equation $p=0$. In this article, we establish a strong constraint on $i$ in terms of the dimension of $q$ and two stable birational invariants of $p$, one of which is the well-known "Izhboldin dimension", and the other of which is a new invariant that we denote $\Delta(p)$. Examining the contribution from the Izhboldin dimension, we obtain a result that unifies and extends the quasilinear analogues of two fundamental results on the isotropy of non-singular quadratic forms over function fields of quadrics in arbitrary characteristic due to Karpenko and Karpenko-Merkurjev, respectively. This proves in a strong way the quasilinear case of a general conjecture previously formulated by the author, suggesting that a substantial refinement of this conjecture should hold.</description>

      <title>On the holes in $I^n$ for symmetric bilinear forms in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field. Following the resolution of Milnor's conjecture relating the graded Witt ring of $F$ to its mod-2 Milnor $K$-theory, a major problem in the theory of symmetric bilinear forms is to understand, for any positive integer $n$, the low-dimensional part of $I^n(F)$, the $n$th power of the fundamental ideal in the Witt ring of $F$. In a 2004 paper, Karpenko used methods from the theory of algebraic cycles to show that if $\mathfrak{b}$ is a non-zero anisotropic symmetric bilinear form of dimension $&lt; 2^{n+1}$ representing an element of $I^n(F)$, then $\mathfrak{b}$ has dimension $2^{n+1} - 2^i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$. When $i = n$, a classical result of Arason and Pfister says that $\mathfrak{b}$ is similar to an $n$-fold Pfister form. At the next level, it has been conjectured that if $n \geq 2$ and $i= n-1$, then $\mathfrak{b}$ is isometric to the tensor product of an $(n-2)$-fold Pfister form and a $6$-dimensional form of trivial discriminant. This has only been shown to be true, however, when $n = 2$, or when $n = 3$ and $\mathrm{char}(F) \neq 2$ (another result of Pfister). In the present article, we prove the conjecture for all values of $n$ in the case where $\mathrm{char}(F) =2$. In addition, we give a short and elementary proof of Karpenko's theorem in the characteristic-2 case, rendering it free from the use of subtle algebraic-geometric tools. Finally, we consider the question of whether additional dimension gaps can appear among the anisotropic forms of dimension $\geq 2^{n+1}$ representing an element of $I^n(F)$. When $\mathrm{char}(F) \neq 2$, a result of Vishik asserts that there are no such gaps, but the situation seems to be less clear when $\mathrm{char}(F) = 2$.</description>

      <title>A recollement approach to Han's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture due to Y. Han asks whether that Hochschild homology groups of a finite dimensional algebra vanish for sufficiently large degrees would imply that the algebra is of finite global dimension. We investigate this conjecture from the viewpoint of recollements of derived categories. It is shown that for a recollement of unbounded derived categories of rings which extends downwards (or upwards) one step, Han's conjecture holds for the ring in the middle if and only if it holds for the two rings on the two sides and hence
  Han's conjecture is reduced to derived $2$-simple rings. Furthermore, this reduction result is applied to Han's conjecture for Morita contexts rings and exact contexts. Finally it is proved that Han's conjecture holds for skew-gentle algebras, category algebras of finite EI categories and Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"{o}er algebras associated to Cartan triples.</description>

Abstract: Clausen--Scholze introduced the notion of solid spectrum in their condensed mathematics program. We demonstrate that the solidification of algebraic $K$-theory recovers two known constructions: the semitopological $K$-theory of a real (associative) algebra and the topological (aka operator) $K$-theory of a real Banach algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of spaces of fitrations on a Noetherian local domain. We introduce a metric $d_1$ on the space of saturated filtrations, inspired by the Darvas metric in complex geometry, such that it is a geodesic metric space. In the toric case, using Newton-Okounkov bodies, we identify the space of saturated monomial filtrations with a subspace of $L^1_\mathrm{loc}$. We also consider several other topologies on such spaces and study the semi-continuity of the log canonical threshold function in the spirit of Koll\'ar-Demailly. Moreover, there is a natural lattice structure on the space of saturated filtrations, which is a generalization of the classical result that the ideals of a ring form a lattice.</description>

Abstract: We investigate from an algebraic and topological point of view the minimal prime spectrum of a universal algebra, considering the prime congruences w.r.t. the term condition commutator. Then we use the topological structure of the minimal prime spectrum to study extensions of universal algebras that generalize certain types of ring extensions. Our results hold for semiprime members of semi-degenerate congruence-modular varieties, as well as semiprime algebras whose term condition commutators are commutative and distributive w.r.t. arbitrary joins and satisfy certain conditions on compact congruences, even if those algebras do not generate congruence-modular varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principal observation of the present paper is that an inner isotopy (i.e. a principal isotopy defined by an algebra endomorphism) is a very helpful instrument in constructing and studying interesting classes of nonassociative algebras. By using methods developed in the paper, we define a new class of commutative nonassociative algebras obtained by inner isotopy from commutative associative polynomial algebras. There is a natural bijection between isomorphism classes of our algebras and integer partitions of the algebra dimensions. Among the interesting features of the nonassociative algebras constructed are that these algebras are generic, some of examples are axial and metrized algebras. We completely describe both the set of algebra idempotents and their spectra.</description>

      <title>On $F$-Polynomials for Generalized Quantum Cluster Algebras and Gupta's Formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the polynomial property of $F$-polynomials for generalized quantum cluster algebras and obtain the associated separation formulas under a mild condition. Along the way, we obtain Gupta's formulas of $F$-polynomials for generalized quantum cluster algebras. These formulas specialize to Gupta's formulas for quantum cluster algebras and cluster algebras respectively. Finally, a generalization of Gupta's formula has also been discussed in the setting of generalized cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dimensional Mathematics: A Foundation For STP/STA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new mathematical structure, called the cross-dimensional mathematics (CDM), is proposed. The CDM considered in this paper consists of three parts: hyper algebra, hyper geometry, and hyper Lie group/Lie algebra. Hyper algebra proposes some new algebraic structures such as hyper group, hyper ring, and hyper module over matrices and vectors with mixed dimensions (MVMDs). They have sets of classical groups, rings, and modules as their components and cross-dimensional connections among their components. Their basic properties are investigated. Hyper geometry starts from mixed dimensional Euclidian space, and hyper vector space. Then the hyper topological vector space, hyper inner product space, and hyper manifold are constructed. They have a joined cross-dimensional geometric structure. Finally, hyper metric space, topological hyper group and hyper Lie algebra are built gradually, and finally, the corresponding hyper Lie group is introduced. All these concepts are built over MVMDs, and to reach our purpose in addition to existing semi-tensor products (STPs) and semi-tensor additions (STAs), a couple of most general STP and STA are introduced. Some existing structures/results about STPs/STAs have also been resumed and integrated into this CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:S\rightarrow R$ be a ring extension. We introduce and study the properties of $(R, S)_\star$-injective modules and the existences of $(R, S)_\star$-injective envelopes. Besides, we show that every $R$-module has an $(R, S)$-injective envelope when $S$ is a pure-semisimple ring.</description>

      <title>On Semi-Nil Clean Rings with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of \textit{semi-nil clean} rings, defined as those rings in which each element can be expressed as a sum of a periodic and a nilpotent element. Among our results, we show that if $R$ is a semi-nil clean NI ring, then $R$ is periodic. Additionally, we demonstrate that every group ring $RG$ of a nilpotent group $G$ over a weakly 2-primal ring $R$ is semi-nil clean if, and only if, $R$ is periodic and $G$ is locally finite.
  Moreover, we also study those rings in which every unit is a sum of a periodic and a nilpotent element, calling them \textit{unit semi-nil clean} rings. As a remarkable result, we show that if $R$ is an algebraic algebra over a field, then $R$ is unit semi-nil clean if, and only if, $R$ is periodic.
  Besides, we explore those rings in which non-zero elements are a sum of a torsion element and a nilpotent element, naming them \textit{t-fine} rings, which constitute a proper subclass of the class of all fine rings. One of the main results is that matrix rings over t-fine rings are again t-fine rings.</description>

      <title>Direct finiteness of representable regular rings with involution: A counterexample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bruns and Roddy constructed a $3$-generated modular ortholattice $L$ which cannot be embedded into any complete modular ortholattice. Motivated by their approach, we use shift operators to construct a $*$-regular $*$-ring $R$ of endomorphisms of an inner product space (which can be chosen as the Hilbert space $\ell^2$) such that direct finiteness fails for $R$.</description>

      <title>Hopfian wreath products and the stable finiteness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hopf property for wreath products of finitely generated groups, focusing on the case of an abelian base group. Our main result establishes a strong connection between this problem and Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture. Namely, the latter holds true if and only if for every finitely generated abelian group $A$ and every finitely generated Hopfian group $\Gamma$ the wreath product $A \wr \Gamma$ is Hopfian. In fact, we characterize precisely when $A \wr \Gamma$ is Hopfian, in terms of the existence of one-sided units in certain matrix algebras over $\mathbb{F}_p[\Gamma]$, for every prime $p$ occurring as the order of some element in $A$. A tool in our arguments is the fact that fields of positive characteristic locally embed into matrix algebras over $\mathbb{F}_p$ thus reducing the stable finiteness conjecture to the case of $\mathbb{F}_p$. A further application of this result shows that the validity of Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture is equivalent to a version of Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for additive cellular automata.</description>

      <title>A top-down approach to algebraic renormalization in regularity structures based on multi-indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algebraic framework to describe renormalization in regularity structures based on multi-indices for a large class of semi-linear stochastic PDEs. This framework is ``top-down", in the sense that we postulate the form of the counterterm and use the renormalized equation to build a canonical smooth model for it. The core of the construction is a generalization of the Hopf algebra of derivations in [LOT23], which is extended beyond the structure group to describe the model equation via an exponential map: This allows to implement a renormalization procedure which resembles the preparation map approach in our context.</description>

      <title>Cyclic duality between BV algebras and BV modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if an operad is at the same time a cosimplicial object such that the respective structure maps are compatible with the operadic composition in a natural way, then one obtains a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on cohomology, and if the operad is cyclic, even that of a BV algebra. In particular, if a cyclic opposite module over an operad with multiplication is itself a cyclic operad that meets the cosimplicial compatibility conditions, the cohomology of its cyclic dual turns into a BV algebra. This amounts to conditions for when the cyclic dual of a BV module is endowed with a BV algebra structure, a result we exemplify by looking at classical and less classical (co)homology groups in Hopf algebra theory.</description>
