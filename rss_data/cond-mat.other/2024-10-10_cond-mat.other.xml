      <title>Direct measurement of the lifetime and coherence time of Cu2O Rydberg excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg states of excitons are promising quantum objects to engineer giant nonlinearities in a solid-state system. For this purpose, a deeper understanding of the dynamics of Rydberg excitons and of their potential for coherent manipulation becomes important. We report experimental results where two-photon absorption is resonant with various Rydberg states of excitons in copper oxide and we detect their emission dynamics on a streak camera with sub-picosecond resolution. This technique enables the direct measurement of the Rydberg states lifetimes, which are in good agreement with the expected Rydberg scaling law. Moreover, we observe several intriguing dynamics including the presence of long-lived coherent oscillations. Finally, we independently measure the coherence time of the Rydberg states using a modified Michelson interferometer and find a good agreement with the coherent oscillations detected in the exciton emission dynamics. The lifetimes also reveal the absence of inhomogeneous broadening in the current high-precision spectroscopic data for the S series, which together with the presence of significant coherence time confirms the suitability of the system for coherent engineering.</description>

      <title>Tight-binding model of Pt-based jacutingaites as combination of the honeycomb and kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refined tight-binding (TB) model for Pt-based jacutingaite materials Pt$_{2}N$X$_{3}$, ($N$ = Zn, Cd, Hg; X = S, Se, Te), offering a detailed representation of the low-energy physics of its monolayers. This model incorporates all elements with significant spin-orbit coupling contributions, which are essential for understanding the topological energy gaps in these materials. Through comparison with first-principles calculations, we meticulously fitted the TB parameters, ensuring an accurate depiction of the energy bands near the Fermi level. Our model reveals the intricate interplay between the Pt $3e$ and $N$ metal orbitals, forming distinct kagome and honeycomb lattice structures. Applying this model, we explore the edge states of Pt-based jacutingaite monolayer nanoribbons, highlighting the sensitivity of the topological edge states dispersion bands to the nanostructures geometric configurations. These insights not only deepen our understanding of jacutingaite materials but also assist in tailoring their electronic properties for future applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling Matter Phases beyond Markov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling phase transitions in quantum systems via coupling to reservoirs has been mostly studied for idealized memory-less environments under the so-called Markov approximation. Yet, most quantum materials and experiments in the solid state, atomic, molecular and optical physics are coupled to reservoirs with finite memory times. Here, using the spectral theory of non-Markovian dissipative phase transitions developed in the companion paper [Debecker et al., Phys. Rev. A 110, 042201 (2024)], we show that memory effects can be leveraged to reshape matter phase boundaries, but also reveal the existence of dissipative phase transitions genuinely triggered by non-Markovian effects.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Displacive Excitation of Coherent Phonons in a Bulk Rashba Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changing the macroscopic properties of quantum materials by optically activating collective lattice excitations has recently become a major trend in solid state physics. One of the most commonly employed light-matter interaction routes is the displacive mechanism. However, the fundamental contribution to this process remains elusive, as the effects of free-carrier density modification and raised effective electronic temperature have not been disentangled yet. Here we use time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy to address this issue in the Rashba semiconductor BiTeI. Exploring the conventional regime of electronic interband transitions for different excitation wavelengths as well as the barely accessed regime of electronic intraband transitions, we answer a long-standing open question regarding the displacive mechanism: the lattice modes are predominantly driven by the rise of the effective electronic temperature. In the intraband regime, which allows to increase the effective carrier temperature while leaving their density unaffected, the phonon coherence time does not display significant fluence-dependent variations. Our results thus reveal a pathway to displacive excitation of coherent phonons, free from additional scattering and dissipation mechanisms typically associated with an increase of the free-carrier density.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced shallow circuits and absence of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of estimating observable expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design an efficient classical algorithm to estimate observable expectation values within any constant additive accuracy, with high probability over the choice of the circuit, in any circuit architecture. The runtime of the algorithm is independent of circuit depth, and for any inverse-polynomial target accuracy, it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output observable expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.</description>

      <title>Two dark components of de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath for matter with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter. Here do not consider the real matter, but only the component which is related to the gravitational degrees of freedom and participates the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. This gravitational component behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter. The vacuum energy and the analog of the Zel'dovich stiff matter represent correspondingly the dark energy and dark matter. In equilibrium the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is rather similar to the correspondingly superfluid and normal components of superfluid liquid, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. We extend this two dark components approach and the suggest the phenomenological theory, which describes the dynamics of the dark energy and the dark matter. For that we assume that the in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter also behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter. In this phenomenological model, both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. How this phenomenology is supported by the microscopic physics is an open question.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transport theory at the order of quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport and attracted tremendous interest. We show that the quantum metric is only a tip of the iceberg, by deriving unknown 11 out of 14 formulas of the quadratic nonlinear conductivity under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges. The formulas allow us to determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for the magnetic point groups, calculate the quadratic nonlinear conductivity for arbitrary Hamiltonian, e.g., the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films with and without the $C_{3}$ symmetry, and formulate scaling laws at the order of quantum metric to distinguish different mechanisms in the recent experiments. The theory is a comprehensive description of the quadratic nonlinear transport and will facilitate future experiments and applications.</description>
