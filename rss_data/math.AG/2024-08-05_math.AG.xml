      <title>Countably Generated Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the completion of an associative algebra $A$ in a set $M=\{M_1,\dots,M_r\}$ of $r$ right $A$-modules in such a way that if $\mathfrak a\subseteq A$ is an ideal in a commutative ring $A$ the completion $A$ in the (right) module $A/\mathfrak a$ is $\hat A^M\simeq \hat A^{\mathfrak a}.$ This works by defining $\hat A^M$ as a formal algebra determined up to a computation in a category called GMMP-algebras. From deformation theory we get that the computation results in a formal algebra which is the prorepresenting hull of the noncommutative deformation functor, and this hull is unique up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the two-dimensional Jacobian conjecture: Magnus' formula revisited, IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(F,G)$ be a Jacobian pair with $d=w\text{-deg}(F)$ and $e=w\text{-deg}(G)$ for some direction $w$. A generalized Magnus' formula approximates $G$ as $\sum_{\gamma\ge 0} c_\gamma F^{\frac{e-\gamma}{d}}$ for some complex numbers $c_\gamma$. We develop an approach to the two-dimensional Jacobian conjecture, aiming to minimize the use of terms corresponding to $\gamma&gt;0$. As an initial step in this approach, we define and study the inner polynomials of $F$ and $G$. The main result of this paper shows that the northeastern vertex of the Newton polygon of each inner polynomial is located within a specific region. As applications of this result, we introduce several conjectures and prove some of them for special cases.</description>

      <title>Attractors, Geodesics, and the Geometry of Moduli Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect recent conjectures and observations pertaining to geodesics, attractor flows, Laplacian eigenvalues and the geometry of moduli spaces by using that attractor flows are geodesics. For toroidal compactifications, attractor points are related to (degenerate) masses of the Laplacian on the target space, and also to the Laplacian on the moduli space. We also explore compactifications of M-Theory to $5$D on a Calabi-Yau threefold and argue that geodesics are unique in a special set of classes, providing further evidence for a recent conjecture by Raman and Vafa. Finally, we describe the role of the marked moduli space in $4$d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ compactifications. We study split attractor flows in an explicit example of the one-parameter family of quintics and discuss setups where flops to isomorphic Calabi-Yau manifolds exist.</description>

      <title>Moderately discontinuous homology of real surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moderately Discontinuous Homology (MD-Homology, for short) was created recently in 2022 by Fern\'andez de Bobadilla at al. and it captures deep Lipschitz phenomena. However, to become a definitive powerful tool, it must be widely comprehended.
  In this paper, we investigate the MD-Homology of definable surface germs for the inner and outer metrics. We completely determine the MD-Homology of surfaces for the inner metric and we present a great variety of interesting MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric, for instance, we determine the MD-Homology of some bubbles, snake surfaces, and horns. Furthermore, we explicit the diversity of MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric in general, showing how hard it is to completely solve the outer classification problem. On the other hand, we show that, under specific conditions, the weakly outer Lipschitz equivalence determines completely the MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric, showing that these two subjects are quite related.</description>

      <title>Igusa Stacks and the Cohomology of Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct functorial Igusa stacks for all Hodge-type Shimura varieties, proving a conjecture of Scholze and extending earlier results of the fourth-named author for PEL-type Shimura varieties. Using the Igusa stack, we construct a sheaf on $\mathrm{Bun}_G$ that controls the cohomology of the corresponding Shimura variety. We use this sheaf and the spectral action of Fargues-Scholze to prove a compatibility between the cohomology of Shimura varieties of Hodge type and the semisimple local Langlands correspondence of Fargues-Scholze, generalizing the Eichler-Shimura relation of Blasius-Rogawski to arbitrary level at $p$. When the given Shimura variety is proper, we show moreover that the sheaf is perverse, which allows us to prove new torsion vanishing results for the cohomology of Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Formula for Osculating Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.00096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety. Using a construction devised to Gathmann, we present a recursive formula for some of the Gromov-Witten invariants of $X$. We prove that, when $X$ is homogeneous, this formula gives the number of osculating rational curves at a general point of a general hypersurface of $X$. This generalizes the classical well known pairs of inflexion (asymptotic) lines for surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ of Salmon, as well as Darboux's $27$ osculating conics.</description>

Abstract: We prove that some Gromov-Witten numbers associated to rational contact (Legendrian) curves in any contact complex projective space with arbitrary incidence conditions are enumerative. Also, we use Bott formula on the Kontsevich space to find the exact value of those numbers. As an example, the numbers of rational contact curves of low degree in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ and $\mathbb{P}^{5}$ are computed. The results are consistent with existing results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Peterson variety is a subvariety of the flag manifold $G/B$ equipped with an action of a one-dimensional torus, and a torus invariant paving by affine cells, called Peterson cells. We prove that the equivariant pull-backs of Schubert classes indexed by arbitrary Coxeter elements are dual (up to an intersection multiplicity) to the fundamental classes of Peterson cell closures. Dividing these classes by the intersection multiplicities yields a $\mathbb Z$-basis for the equivariant cohomology of the Peterson variety. We prove several properties of this basis, including a Graham positivity property for its structure constants, and stability with respect to inclusion in a larger Peterson variety. We also find formulae for intersection multiplicities with Peterson classes. This explains geometrically, in arbitrary Lie type, recent positivity statements proved in type A by Goldin and Gorbutt.</description>

      <title>Classification of Unimodal Parametric Plane Curve Singularities in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2011, Hefez and Hernandes completed Zariski's analytic classification of plane branches belonging to a certain equisingularity class by creating "very short" parameterizations over the complex numbers. Their results were used by Mehmood and Pfister to classify unimodal plane branches in characteristic 0 by constructing lists of normal forms. The goal of this paper is to give a complete classification of unimodal plane branches over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Since the methods of Hefez and Hernandes are not applicable in positive characteristic, we use a different approach and, for some sporadic singularities in small characteristic, computations with SINGULAR. Our methods are characteristic-independent and provide a different proof for the classification in characteristic 0, showing at the same time that this classification holds also in large characteristic. The main theoretical ingredients are the semicontinuity of the semigroup and the modality, which we prove.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by previous work on moment varieties for Gaussian distributions and their mixtures, we study moment varieties for two other statistically important two-parameter distributions: the inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions. In particular, we realize the moment varieties as determinantal varieties and find their degrees and singularities. We also provide computational evidence for algebraic identifiability of mixtures, and study the identifiability degree and Euclidean distance degree.</description>

      <title>Algebraic algorithms for vector bundles over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We represent vector bundles over a regular algebraic curve as pairs of lattices over the maximal orders of its function field and we give polynomial time algorithms for several tasks: computing determinants of vector bundles, kernels and images of global homomorphisms, isomorphisms between vector bundles, cohomology groups, extensions, and splitting into a direct sum of indecomposables. Most algorithms are deterministic except for computing isomorphisms when the base field is infinite. Some algorithms are only polynomial time if we may compute Hermite forms of pseudo-matrices in polynomial time. All algorithms rely exclusively on algebraic operations in function fields. For applications, we give an algorithm enumerating isomorphism classes of vector bundles on an elliptic curve, and to construct algebraic geometry codes over vector bundles. We implement all our algorithms into a SageMath package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the case of primary field extensions, the extension of scalars of Deligne $1$-motives admits a left adjoint, called Chow image, and a right adjoint, called Chow trace. This generalizes Chow's results on abelian varieties. Then we study the Chow trace in the framework of Voevodsky's triangulated categories of (\'etale) motives. With respect to the $1$-motivic $t$-structure on the category of Voevodsky's homological $1$-motives, the zero-th direct image of an abelian variety is given by the Chow trace, and the first direct image is the $0$-motive defined by the (geometric) Lang-N\'eron group.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the birational geometry of some hyperk\"ahler fourfolds of Picard rank $3$ obtained as the Fano varieties of lines on cubic fourfolds containing pairs of cubic scrolls. In each of the two cases considered, we provide a census of the birational models, relating each model to familiar geometric constructions. We also provide structural results about the birational automorphism groups, giving generators in both cases and a full set of relations in one case. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain non-isomorphic cubic fourfolds whose Fano varieties of lines are birationally equivalent.</description>

      <title>Unitary representations of real groups and localization theory for Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Schmid and the second named author that the unitarity of a representation of a real reductive Lie group with real infinitesimal character can be read off from a canonical filtration, the Hodge filtration. Our proof rests on three main ingredients. The first is a wall crossing theory for mixed Hodge modules: the key result is that, in certain natural families, the Hodge filtration varies semi-continuously with jumps controlled by extension functors. The second ingredient is a Hodge-theoretic refinement of Beilinson-Bernstein localization: we show that the Hodge filtration of a mixed Hodge module on the flag variety satisfies the usual cohomology vanishing and global generation properties enjoyed by the underlying $\mathcal{D}$-module. The third ingredient is an explicit calculation of the Hodge filtration on a tempered Hodge module. As byproducts of our work, we obtain a version of Saito's Kodaira vanishing for twisted mixed Hodge modules, a calculation of the Hodge filtration on a certain object in category $\mathcal{O}$, and a host of new vanishing results for coherent sheaves on flag varieties.</description>
