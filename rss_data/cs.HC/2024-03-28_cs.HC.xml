      <title>Scrolly2Reel: Turning News Graphics into TikToks by Adjusting Narrative Beats and Pacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As media evolves, storytelling evolves. In 2012, newspapers introduced scrollytelling sequences, or "scrollies," to make news more immersive and interactive on the web. As users scroll through an article, graphics like animation, charts, and 3D visualizations appear to provide visual dynamics to the story. Today, news consumption is shifting to short-video platforms like TikTok, particularly among younger audiences. We propose repurposing the assets from scrollies and computationally transform them into videos. By shortening the original written text and precisely synchronizing the timing of audio narrative with features in the visual scrolling assets, we can create reels with dynamic pacing and narrative beats. We argue that text shortening is essential to producing fast paced videos that are compelling and visually interesting, and show that when beats are preserved in the output reel, topical alignment between them and the visual assets is crucial to the viewing experience. Understanding narrative pacing and beats in creative forms is key to user experience of media. They are an important primitive to effective editing, repurposing, and retargeting content while maintaining a cohesive narrative.</description>

      <title>Eternagram: Probing Player Attitudes in Alternate Climate Scenarios Through a ChatGPT-Driven Text Adventure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional methods of assessing attitudes towards climate change are limited in capturing authentic opinions, primarily stemming from a lack of context-specific assessment strategies and an overreliance on simplistic surveys. Game-based Assessments (GBA) have demonstrated the ability to overcome these issues by immersing participants in engaging gameplay within carefully crafted, scenario-based environments. Concurrently, advancements in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) show promise in enhancing the gamified testing environment, achieving this by generating context-aware, human-like dialogues that contribute to a more natural and effective assessment. Our study introduces a new technique for probing climate change attitudes by actualizing a GPT-driven chatbot system in harmony with a game design depicting a futuristic climate scenario. The correlation analysis reveals an assimilation effect, where players' post-game climate awareness tends to align with their in-game perceptions. Key predictors of pro-climate attitudes are identified as traits like 'Openness' and 'Agreeableness', and a preference for democratic values.</description>

      <title>LLMs in HCI Data Work: Bridging the Gap Between Information Retrieval and Responsible Research Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate information extraction from scientific papers is significant in the rapidly developing human-computer interaction research in the literature review process. Our paper introduces and analyses a new information retrieval system using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with structured text analysis techniques to extract experimental data from HCI literature, emphasizing key elements. Then We analyze the challenges and risks of using LLMs in the world of research. We performed a comprehensive analysis on our conducted dataset, which contained the specified information of 300 CHI 2020-2022 papers, to evaluate the performance of the two large language models, GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and Llama-2-70b, paired with structured text analysis techniques. The GPT-3.5 model gains an accuracy of 58\% and a mean absolute error of 7.00. In contrast, the Llama2 model indicates an accuracy of 56\% with a mean absolute error of 7.63. The ability to answer questions was also included in the system in order to work with streamlined data. By evaluating the risks and opportunities presented by LLMs, our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on establishing methodological validity and ethical guidelines for LLM use in HCI data work.</description>

      <title>Neighbor-Environment Observer: An Intelligent Agent for Immersive Working Companionship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-computer symbiosis is a crucial direction for the development of artificial intelligence. As intelligent systems become increasingly prevalent in our work and personal lives, it is important to develop strategies to support users across physical and virtual environments. While technological advances in personal digital devices, such as personal computers and virtual reality devices, can provide immersive experiences, they can also disrupt users' awareness of their surroundings and enhance the frustration caused by disturbances. In this paper, we propose a joint observation strategy for artificial agents to support users across virtual and physical environments. We introduce a prototype system, neighbor-environment observer (NEO), that utilizes non-invasive sensors to assist users in dealing with disruptions to their immersive experience. System experiments evaluate NEO from different perspectives and demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint observation strategy. A user study is conducted to evaluate its usability. The results show that NEO could lessen users' workload with the learned user preference. We suggest that the proposed strategy can be applied to various smart home scenarios.</description>

      <title>iFace: Hand-Over-Face Gesture Recognition Leveraging Impedance Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-over-face gestures can provide important implicit interactions during conversations, such as frustration or excitement. However, in situations where interlocutors are not visible, such as phone calls or textual communication, the potential meaning contained in the hand-over-face gestures is lost. In this work, we present iFace, an unobtrusive, wearable impedance-sensing solution for recognizing different hand-over-face gestures. In contrast to most existing works, iFace does not require the placement of sensors on the user's face or hands. Instead, we proposed a novel sensing configuration, the shoulders, which remains invisible to both the user and outside observers. The system can monitor the shoulder-to-shoulder impedance variation caused by gestures through electrodes attached to each shoulder. We evaluated iFace in a user study with eight participants, collecting six kinds of hand-over-face gestures with different meanings. Using a convolutional neural network and a user-dependent classification, iFace reaches 82.58 \% macro F1 score. We discuss potential application scenarios of iFace as an implicit interaction interface.</description>

      <title>From Virtual Reality to the Emerging Discipline of Perception Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes the case that a powerful new discipline, which we term perception engineering, is steadily emerging. It follows from a progression of ideas that involve creating illusions, from historical paintings and film, to video games and virtual reality in modern times. Rather than creating physical artifacts such as bridges, airplanes, or computers, perception engineers create illusory perceptual experiences. The scope is defined over any agent that interacts with the physical world, including both biological organisms (humans, animals) and engineered systems (robots, autonomous systems). The key idea is that an agent, called a producer, alters the environment with the intent to alter the perceptual experience of another agent, called a receiver. Most importantly, the paper introduces a precise mathematical formulation of this process, based on the von Neumann-Morgenstern notion of information, to help scope and define the discipline. It is then applied to the cases of engineered and biological agents with discussion of its implications on existing fields such as virtual reality, robotics, and even social media. Finally, open challenges and opportunities for involvement are identified.</description>

      <title>Will You Participate? Exploring the Potential of Robotics Competitions on Human-centric Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents findings from an exploratory needfinding study investigating the research current status and potential participation of the competitions on the robotics community towards four human-centric topics: safety, privacy, explainability, and federated learning. We conducted a survey with 34 participants across three distinguished European robotics consortia, nearly 60% of whom possessed over five years of research experience in robotics. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed that current mainstream robotic researchers prioritize safety and explainability, expressing a greater willingness to invest in further research in these areas. Conversely, our results indicate that privacy and federated learning garner less attention and are perceived to have lower potential. Additionally, the study suggests a lack of enthusiasm within the robotics community for participating in competitions related to these topics. Based on these findings, we recommend targeting other communities, such as the machine learning community, for future competitions related to these four human-centric topics.</description>

      <title>SolderlessPCB: Reusing Electronic Components in PCB Prototyping through Detachable 3D Printed Housings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iterative prototyping process for printed circuit boards (PCBs) frequently employs surface-mounted device (SMD) components, which are often discarded rather than reused due to the challenges associated with desoldering, leading to unnecessary electronic waste. This paper introduces SolderlessPCB, a collection of techniques for solder-free PCB prototyping, specifically designed to promote the recycling and reuse of electronic components. Central to this approach are custom 3D-printable housings that allow SMD components to be mounted onto PCBs without soldering. We detail the design of SolderlessPCB and the experiments conducted to evaluate its design parameters, electrical performance, and durability. To illustrate the potential for reusing SMD components with SolderlessPCB, we discuss two scenarios: the reuse of components from earlier design iterations and from obsolete prototypes. We also provide examples demonstrating that SolderlessPCB can handle high-current applications and is suitable for high-speed data transmission. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of our approach and suggesting future directions to overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Domain Adaptation with Temporal Attention for Cross-User Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a predominant assumption is that the data utilized for training and evaluation purposes are drawn from the same distribution. It is also assumed that all data samples are independent and identically distributed ($\displaystyle i.i.d.$). Contrarily, practical implementations often challenge this notion, manifesting data distribution discrepancies, especially in scenarios such as cross-user HAR. Domain adaptation is the promising approach to address these challenges inherent in cross-user HAR tasks. However, a clear gap in domain adaptation techniques is the neglect of the temporal relation embedded within time series data during the phase of aligning data distributions. Addressing this oversight, our research presents the Deep Generative Domain Adaptation with Temporal Attention (DGDATA) method. This novel method uniquely recognises and integrates temporal relations during the domain adaptation process. By synergizing the capabilities of generative models with the Temporal Relation Attention mechanism, our method improves the classification performance in cross-user HAR. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted on three public sensor-based HAR datasets targeting different scenarios and applications to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DGDATA method.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT Role-play Dataset: Analysis of User Motives and Model Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in interactive large language models like ChatGPT have revolutionized various domains; however, their behavior in natural and role-play conversation settings remains underexplored. In our study, we address this gap by deeply investigating how ChatGPT behaves during conversations in different settings by analyzing its interactions in both a normal way and a role-play setting. We introduce a novel dataset of broad range of human-AI conversations annotated with user motives and model naturalness to examine (i) how humans engage with the conversational AI model, and (ii) how natural are AI model responses. Our study highlights the diversity of user motives when interacting with ChatGPT and variable AI naturalness, showing not only the nuanced dynamics of natural conversations between humans and AI, but also providing new avenues for improving the effectiveness of human-AI communication.</description>

      <title>A Novel Behavior-Based Recommendation System for E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of existing recommender systems rely on user ratings, which are limited by the lack of user collaboration and the sparsity problem. To address these issues, this study proposes a behavior-based recommender system that leverages customers' natural behaviors, such as browsing and clicking, on e-commerce platforms. The proposed recommendation system involves clustering active customers, determining neighborhoods, collecting similar users, calculating product reputation based on similar users, and recommending high-reputation products. To overcome the complexity of customer behaviors and traditional clustering methods, an unsupervised clustering approach based on product categories is developed to enhance the recommendation methodology. This study makes notable contributions in several aspects. Firstly, a groundbreaking behavior-based recommendation methodology is developed, incorporating customer behavior to generate accurate and tailored recommendations leading to improved customer satisfaction and engagement. Secondly, an original unsupervised clustering method, focusing on product categories, enables more precise clustering and facilitates accurate recommendations. Finally, an approach to determine neighborhoods for active customers within clusters is established, ensuring grouping of customers with similar behavioral patterns to enhance recommendation accuracy and relevance. The proposed recommendation methodology and clustering method contribute to improved recommendation performance, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of e-commerce recommendation systems. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods in experiments conducted using a behavior dataset from the well-known e-commerce site Alibaba.</description>

Abstract: In digital markets, antitrust law and special regulations aim to ensure that markets remain competitive despite the dominating role that digital platforms play today in everyone's life. Unlike traditional markets, market participant behavior is easily observable in these markets. We present a series of empirical investigations into the extent to which Amazon engages in practices that are typically described as self-preferencing. We discuss how the computer science tools used in this paper can be used in a regulatory environment that is based on algorithmic auditing and requires regulating digital markets at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vital signs are crucial in intensive care units (ICUs). They are used to track the patient's state and to identify clinically significant changes. Predicting vital sign trajectories is valuable for early detection of adverse events. However, conventional machine learning metrics like RMSE often fail to capture the true clinical relevance of such predictions. We introduce novel vital sign prediction performance metrics that align with clinical contexts, focusing on deviations from clinical norms, overall trends, and trend deviations. These metrics are derived from empirical utility curves obtained in a previous study through interviews with ICU clinicians. We validate the metrics' usefulness using simulated and real clinical datasets (MIMIC and eICU). Furthermore, we employ these metrics as loss functions for neural networks, resulting in models that excel in predicting clinically significant events. This research paves the way for clinically relevant machine learning model evaluation and optimization, promising to improve ICU patient care. 10 pages, 9 figures.</description>

      <title>An Exploratory Study on Upper-Level Computing Students' Use of Large Language Models as Tools in a Semester-Long Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and CoPilot are influencing software engineering practice. Software engineering educators must teach future software engineers how to use such tools well. As of yet, there have been few studies that report on the use of LLMs in the classroom. It is, therefore, important to evaluate students' perception of LLMs and possible ways of adapting the computing curriculum to these shifting paradigms.
  Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore computing students' experiences and approaches to using LLMs during a semester-long software engineering project.
  Design/Method: We collected data from a senior-level software engineering course at Purdue University. This course uses a project-based learning (PBL) design. The students used LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot in their projects. A sample of these student teams were interviewed to understand (1) how they used LLMs in their projects; and (2) whether and how their perspectives on LLMs changed over the course of the semester. We analyzed the data to identify themes related to students' usage patterns and learning outcomes.
  Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications. In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks. However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes. Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Teaching Introductory HRI: UChicago Course "Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2020, I designed the course CMSC 20630/30630 Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice as a hands-on introduction to human-robot interaction (HRI) research for both undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Chicago. Since 2020, I have taught and refined this course each academic year. Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice focuses on the core concepts and cutting-edge research in the field of human-robot interaction (HRI), covering topics that include: nonverbal robot behavior, verbal robot behavior, social dynamics, norms &amp; ethics, collaboration &amp; learning, group interactions, applications, and future challenges of HRI. Course meetings involve students in the class leading discussions about cutting-edge peer-reviewed research HRI publications. Students also participate in a quarter-long collaborative research project, where they pursue an HRI research question that often involves conducing their own human-subjects research study where they recruit human subjects to interact with a robot. In this paper, I detail the structure of the course and its learning goals as well as my reflections and student feedback on the course.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advances in AI-enabled techniques have accelerated the creation and automation of visualizations in the past decade. However, presenting visualizations in a descriptive and generative format remains a challenge. Moreover, current visualization embedding methods focus on standalone visualizations, neglecting the importance of contextual information for multi-view visualizations. To address this issue, we propose a new representation model, Chart2Vec, to learn a universal embedding of visualizations with context-aware information. Chart2Vec aims to support a wide range of downstream visualization tasks such as recommendation and storytelling. Our model considers both structural and semantic information of visualizations in declarative specifications. To enhance the context-aware capability, Chart2Vec employs multi-task learning on both supervised and unsupervised tasks concerning the cooccurrence of visualizations. We evaluate our method through an ablation study, a user study, and a quantitative comparison. The results verified the consistency of our embedding method with human cognition and showed its advantages over existing methods.</description>

      <title>ABScribe: Rapid Exploration &amp; Organization of Multiple Writing Variations in Human-AI Co-Writing Tasks using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring alternative ideas by rewriting text is integral to the writing process. State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) can simplify writing variation generation. However, current interfaces pose challenges for simultaneous consideration of multiple variations: creating new variations without overwriting text can be difficult, and pasting them sequentially can clutter documents, increasing workload and disrupting writers' flow. To tackle this, we present ABScribe, an interface that supports rapid, yet visually structured, exploration and organization of writing variations in human-AI co-writing tasks. With ABScribe, users can swiftly modify variations using LLM prompts, which are auto-converted into reusable buttons. Variations are stored adjacently within text fields for rapid in-place comparisons using mouse-over interactions on a popup toolbar. Our user study with 12 writers shows that ABScribe significantly reduces task workload (d = 1.20, p &lt; 0.001), enhances user perceptions of the revision process (d = 2.41, p &lt; 0.001) compared to a popular baseline workflow, and provides insights into how writers explore variations using LLMs.</description>

      <title>Building an Open-Source Community to Enhance Autonomic Nervous System Signal Analysis: DBDP-Autonomic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphones and wearable sensors offer an unprecedented ability to collect peripheral psychophysiological signals across diverse timescales, settings, populations, and modalities. However, open-source software development has yet to keep pace with rapid advancements in hardware technology and availability, creating an analytical barrier that limits the scientific usefulness of acquired data. We propose a community-driven, open-source peripheral psychophysiological signal pre-processing and analysis software framework that could advance biobehavioral health by enabling more robust, transparent, and reproducible inferences involving autonomic nervous system data.</description>

      <title>SeSaMe: A Framework to Simulate Self-Reported Ground Truth for Mental Health Sensing Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in mobile and wearable technologies have enabled the potential to passively monitor a person's mental, behavioral, and affective health. These approaches typically rely on longitudinal collection of self-reported outcomes, e.g., depression, stress, and anxiety, to train machine learning (ML) models. However, the need to continuously self-report adds a significant burden on the participants, often resulting in attrition, missing labels, or insincere responses. In this work, we introduce the Scale Scores Simulation using Mental Models (SeSaMe) framework to alleviate participants' burden in digital mental health studies. By leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), SeSaMe enables the simulation of participants' responses on psychological scales. In SeSaMe, researchers can prompt LLMs with information on participants' internal behavioral dispositions, enabling LLMs to construct mental models of participants to simulate their responses on psychological scales. We demonstrate an application of SeSaMe, where we use GPT-4 to simulate responses on one scale using responses from another as behavioral information. We also evaluate the alignment between human and SeSaMe-simulated responses to psychological scales. Then, we present experiments to inspect the utility of SeSaMe-simulated responses as ground truth in training ML models by replicating established depression and anxiety screening tasks from a previous study. Our results indicate SeSaMe to be a promising approach, but its alignment may vary across scales and specific prediction objectives. We also observed that model performance with simulated data was on par with using the real data for training in most evaluation scenarios. We conclude by discussing the potential implications of SeSaMe in addressing some challenges researchers face with ground-truth collection in passive sensing studies.</description>

      <title>HIVE: Harnessing Human Feedback for Instructional Visual Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating human feedback has been shown to be crucial to align text generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Data journeys in popular science: Producing climate change and COVID-19 data visualizations at Scientific American</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vast amounts of (open) data are increasingly used to make arguments about crisis topics such as climate change and global pandemics. Data visualizations are central to bringing these viewpoints to broader publics. However, visualizations often conceal the many contexts involved in their production, ranging from decisions made in research labs about collecting and sharing data to choices made in editorial rooms about which data stories to tell. In this paper, we examine how data visualizations about climate change and COVID-19 are produced in popular science magazines, using Scientific American, an established English-language popular science magazine, as a case study. To do this, we apply the analytical concept of data journeys (Leonelli, 2020) in a mixed methods study that centers on interviews with Scientific American staff and is supplemented by a visualization analysis of selected charts. In particular, we discuss the affordances of working with open data, the role of collaborative data practices, and how the magazine works to counter misinformation and increase transparency. This work provides an empirical contribution by providing insight into the data (visualization) practices of science communicators and demonstrating how the concept of data journeys can be used as an analytical framework.</description>

      <title>GPT-4's assessment of its performance in a USMLE-based case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare applications. A simple prompting technique was used to prompt the LLM with questions taken from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire and it was tasked to evaluate its confidence score before posing the question and after asking the question. The questionnaire was categorized into two groups-questions with feedback (WF) and questions with no feedback(NF) post-question. The model was asked to provide absolute and relative confidence scores before and after each question. The experimental findings were analyzed using statistical tools to study the variability of confidence in WF and NF groups. Additionally, a sequential analysis was conducted to observe the performance variation for the WF and NF groups. Results indicate that feedback influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it. Understanding the performance of LLM is paramount in exploring its utility in sensitive areas like healthcare. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the reliability of AI, particularly of LLMs like GPT-4, within healthcare, offering insights into how feedback mechanisms might be optimized to enhance AI-assisted medical education and decision support.</description>

      <title>The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.</description>
