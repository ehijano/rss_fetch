      <title>Gambling Carnot Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model for a colloidal heat engine driven by a feedback protocol that is able to fully convert the net heat absorbed by the hot bath into extracted work. The feedback protocol, inspired by gambling strategies, executes a sudden quench at zero work cost when the particle position satisfies a specific first-passage condition. As a result, the engine enhances both power and efficiency with respect to a standard Carnot cycle, surpassing Carnot's efficiency at maximum power. Using first-passage and martingale theory, we derive analytical expressions for the power and efficiency far beyond the quasistatic limit and provide scaling arguments for their dependency with the cycle duration. Numerical simulations are in perfect agreement with our theoretical findings, and illustrate the impact of the data acquisition rate on the engine's performance.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and the Noncrossing Partition Lattice in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate details of the chaotic dynamics of dual-unitary quantum circuits by evaluating all $2k$-point out-of-time-ordered correlators. For the generic class of circuits, by writing the correlators as contractions of a class of quantum channels, we prove their exponential decay. This implies that local operators separated in time approach free independence. Along the way, we develop a replica trick for dual-unitary circuits, which may be useful and of interest in its own right. We classify the relevant eigenstates of the replica transfer matrix by paths in the lattice of noncrossing partitions, combinatorial objects central to free probability theory. Interestingly, the noncrossing lattice emerges even for systems without randomness and with small onsite Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Enhanced correlations due to ballistic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of density-density correlations in a 1D gas of hard-core particles initially prepared at equilibrium (either at zero or finite temperature) on a semi-infinite line and subsequently let to expand into the other (initially empty) half of the system. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on exact methods and asymptotic hydrodynamic approaches, we discuss the behavior of the gas as its initial temperature varies, and back up our derivations with numerical exact diagonalization of the model. Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the initial temperature, the non-equilibrium behavior of density-density correlations at sufficiently large times is characterized by algebraic decay. Furthermore, we provide analytical results based on quantum generalized hydrodynamics that match with the numerical data both at zero and finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Entropic selection of magnetization in a frustrated 2D magnetic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.</description>

      <title>Shock propagation following an intense explosion in an inhomogeneous gas: core scaling and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shock propagation in a spatially inhomogeneous gas following an intense explosion. We generalize the exact solution of the Euler equation for the spatio-temporal variation of density, velocity, and temperature to arbitrary dimensions. From the asymptotic behavior of the solution near the shock center, we argue that only for a critical dimension dependent initial density distribution will the Euler equation provide a correct description of the problem. For general initial density distributions, we use event-driven molecular dynamics simulations in one dimension to demonstrate that the Euler equation fails to capture the behavior near the shock center. However, the Navier-Stokes equation successfully resolves this issue. The crossover length scale below which the dissipation terms are relevant and the core scaling for the data near the shock center are derived and confirmed in EDMD simulations.</description>

      <title>Global fixed point potential approach to frustrated antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the critical behavior of classical frustrated systems using the nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) equation. Our study is performed within the local potential approximation of this equation to which is added the flow of the field renormalization. Our flow equations are functional to avoid possible artifacts coming from the field expansion of the fixed point potential which consists in keeping only a limited number of coupling constants. We explain in detail our numerical implementation, its advantages and the difficulties encountered in the vicinity of $d=2$. For $N$-component spins, the function $N_c(d)$ separating the regions of first and second order transitions in the $(d,N)$ plane is computed for $d$ between 4 and 2.3. Our results confirm what was previously found with cruder approximations of the NPRG equation and contradict both the fixed dimension perturbative approach and some of the results obtained within the conformal bootstrap approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and spectral decompositions of the generalized friction tensor for optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a prominent role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. The optimization problem rarely admits exact analytic solutions, but under slow driving it can be recast geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. Minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here we derive two decompositions of a full-control friction tensor that assumes total control over the potential energy. Arbitrary conservative-control friction tensors are then inherited metrics on hypersurfaces of constraint. Our reformulation simplifies the derivation of friction tensors for many systems and provides design principles for optimal control. This approach gives insight into the domain of applicability of the friction-tensor formalism by demonstrating explicitly how minimum-work protocols take advantage of multi-exponential relaxation to increase accuracy.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Sampling by Diabatic Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that diabatic quantum annealing (DQA), which turns off the transverse field at a finite speed, produces samples well described by the Boltzmann distribution. We analytically show that, up to linear order in quenching time, the DQA approximates a high-temperature Boltzmann distribution. Our theory yields an explicit relation between the quenching rate of the DQA and the temperature of the Boltzmann distribution. Based on this result, we discuss how the DQA can be utilized to train the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).</description>

      <title>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. This is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and outof-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps of local quantum channels in the weak-dissipation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of generic chaotic quantum many-body systems with no conservation laws, subject to weak bulk dissipation. It was recently observed [T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] that the generator of these dissipative dynamics, a quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$, retains a nonzero gap as the dissipation strength $\gamma \to 0$ if the thermodynamic limit is taken first. We use a hydrodynamic description of operator spreading in the presence of dissipation to estimate the gap of $\mathcal{E}$ as $\gamma \to 0$; to calculate the operator-size distribution of the low-lying eigenmodes of $\mathcal{E}$; and to relate the gap to the long-time decay rates of autocorrelation functions under unitary dynamics. We provide a microscopic derivation of this hydrodynamic perspective for random unitary circuits. We argue that the gap in the $\gamma \to 0$ limit can change nonanalytically as one tunes the parameters of the unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rates and quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances: insights from operator hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the expansion of the universe using the Gr\"uneisen parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a perfect fluid, pressure $p$ and energy density $\rho$ are related via the equation of state (EOS) $\omega = p/\rho$, where $\omega$ is the EOS parameter, being its interpretation usually constrained to a numerical value for each universe era. Here, based on the Mie-Gr\"uneisen EOS, we show that $\omega$ is recognized as the effective Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma_{eff}$, whose singular contribution, the so-called Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$, quantifies the barocaloric effect. Our analysis suggests that the negative $p$ associated with dark-energy implies a metastable state and that in the dark-energy-dominated era $\omega$ is time-dependent, which reinforces recent proposals of a time-dependent cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\Gamma_{eff}$ is embodied in the energy-momentum stress tensor in the Einstein field equations, enabling us to analyse, in the frame of an imperfect fluid picture, anisotropic effects of the universe expansion. We propose that upon going from decelerated- to accelerated-expansion, a phase transition-like behavior can be inferred. Yet, our analysis in terms of entropy, $\Gamma$, and a by us adapted version of Avramov/Casalini's model to Cosmology unveil hidden aspects related to the expansion of the universe. Our findings pave the way to interpret cosmological phenomena in connection with concepts of condensed matter Physics via $\Gamma_{eff}$.</description>

Abstract: Protein compartmentalization in the frame of a liquid-liquid phase separation is a key mechanism to optimize spatiotemporal control of biological systems. Such a compartmentalization process reduces the intrinsic noise in protein concentration due to stochasticity in gene expression. Employing Flory-Huggins solution theory, Avramov/Casalini's model, and the Gr\"uneisen parameter, we unprecedentedly propose a cellular Griffiths-like phase (CGLP), which can impact its functionality and self-organization. The here-proposed CGLP is key ranging from the understanding of primary organisms' evolution to the treatment of diseases. Our findings pave the way for an alternative Biophysics approach to investigate coacervation processes.</description>

      <title>Fatigue failure in glasses under cyclic shear deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solids subjected to repeated cycles of stress or deformation can fail after several cycles, a phenomenon termed fatigue failure. Although intensely investigated for a wide range of materials owing to its obvious practical importance, a microscopic understanding of the initiation of fatigue failure continues to be actively pursued, in particular for soft and amorphous materials. We investigate fatigue failure for glasses subjected to cyclic shear deformation through computer simulations. We show that, approaching the so-called fatigue limit, failure times display a power law divergence, at variance with commonly used functional forms, and exhibit strong dependence on the degree of annealing of the glasses. We explore several measures of damage, based on quantification of plastic rearrangements and on dissipated energy. Strikingly, the fraction of particles that undergo plastic rearrangements, and a percolation transition they undergo, are predictive of failure. We also find a robust power law relationship between accumulated damage, quantified by dissipated energy or non-affine displacements, and the failure times, which permits prediction of failure times based on behavior in the initial cycles. These observations reveal salient new microscopic features of fatigue failure and suggest approaches for developing a full microscopic picture of fatigue failure in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Conformations and Dynamics of Active Block Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous distribution of passive and active domains in the chromosome plays a crucial role for its dynamic organization within the cell nucleus. Motivated by that here we investigate the steady-state conformation and dynamics of a model active-block copolymer using numerical simulations. Our results show that depending on the relative arrangements of the active and passive blocks, the polymer shows an unusual swelling, even larger than the corresponding fully active polymer. On the one hand, the dynamics of the full polymer show usual enhanced diffusion and Rouse-like scaling behavior. On the other hand, individual passive and active blocks show anomalous transient super- and sub-diffusive dynamics. We characterize this anomalous dynamics in terms of the dependence of a generalized diffusion constant with the polymer length and activity strength.</description>

      <title>Information thermodynamics: from physics to neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a perspective on applying the concepts of information thermodynamics, developed recently in non-equilibrium statistical physics, to problems in theoretical neuroscience. Historically, information and energy in neuroscience have been treated separately, in contrast to physics approaches, where the relationship of entropy production with heat is a central idea. It is argued here that also in neural systems information and energy can be considered within the same theoretical framework. Starting from basic ideas of thermodynamics and information theory on a classic Brownian particle, it is shown how noisy neural networks can infer its probabilistic motion. The decoding of the particle motion by neurons is performed with some accuracy and it has some energy cost, and both can be determined using information thermodynamics. In a similar fashion, we also discuss how neural networks in the brain can learn the particle velocity, and maintain that information in the weights of plastic synapses from a physical point of view. Generally, it is shown how the framework of stochastic and information thermodynamics can be used practically to study neural inference, learning, and information storing.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in $\ell_1$ Regularized Regression: Hyperparameter Selection Strategy based on Sharp Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning techniques aim to leverage information from multiple related datasets to enhance prediction quality against a target dataset. Such methods have been adopted in the context of high-dimensional sparse regression, and some Lasso-based algorithms have been invented: Trans-Lasso and Pretraining Lasso are such examples. These algorithms require the statistician to select hyperparameters that control the extent and type of information transfer from related datasets. However, selection strategies for these hyperparameters, as well as the impact of these choices on the algorithm's performance, have been largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a thorough, precise study of the algorithm in a high-dimensional setting via an asymptotic analysis using the replica method. Our approach reveals a surprisingly simple behavior of the algorithm: Ignoring one of the two types of information transferred to the fine-tuning stage has little effect on generalization performance, implying that efforts for hyperparameter selection can be significantly reduced. Our theoretical findings are also empirically supported by real-world applications on the IMDb dataset.</description>

      <title>Surface Scattering Expansion for the Casimir-Polder Interaction of a Dielectric Wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic scattering amplitude of a dielectric wedge is not known in closed form. This makes the computation of the Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction between a polarizable particle and a dielectric wedge challenging. This geometry is a prototype for the effect of edges on fluctuation-induced interactions, and hence it is important to employ new methods for this problem. Using a recently developed multiple scattering expansion [T. Emig and G. Bimonte, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 200401 (2023)], here we implement a basis-free numerical evaluation of this expansion to obtain precise estimates of the CP potential for a wedge over a wide range of dielectric constants. A remarkable finding is that the CP potential for a dielectric wedge with a smoothed edge is closely related to the potential of a sharp wedge made of a perfect electric conductor. The latter potential is known exactly, making this relation particularly useful in practice.</description>

      <title>Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits many systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic statistical regularity of topological charges revealed in dynamical disk model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying ordered structures hidden in the packings of particles is a common scientific question in multiple fields. In this work, we investigate the dynamical organizations of a large number of initially randomly packed repulsive particles confined on a disk under the Hamiltonian dynamics by the recently developed algorithm called the random batch method. This algorithm is specifically designed for reducing the computational complexity of long-range interacting particle systems. We highlight the revealed intrinsic statistical regularity of topological charges that is otherwise unattainable by the continuum analysis of particle density. We also identify distinct collective dynamics of the interacting particles under short- and long-range repulsive forces. This work shows the robustness and effectiveness of the concept of topological charge for characterizing the convoluted particle dynamics, and demonstrates the promising potential of the random batch method for exploring fundamental scientific questions arising in a variety of long-range interacting particle systems in soft matter physics and other relevant fields.</description>

      <title>A neural network study of the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical phenomena of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4$ are investigated using the techniques of neural networks (NN). In particular, an unconventional supervised NN which is trained using no information about the physics of the considered systems is employed. In addition, conventional unsupervised autoencoders (AECs) are used in our study as well. Remarkably, while the conventional AECs fail to uncover the critical phenomena of the systems investigated here, our unconventional supervised NN correctly identifies the critical behaviors of all three considered antiferromagnetic $q$-state models. The results obtained in this study suggest convincingly that the applicability of our unconventional supervised NN is broader than one anticipates. In particular, when a new system is studied with our NN, it is likely that it is not necessary to conduct any training, and one only needs to examine whether an appropriate reduced representation of the original raw configurations exists, so that the same already trained NN can be employed to explore the related phase transition efficiently.</description>

      <title>Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned ones. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols can modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Defining a universal sign to strictly probe a phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated systems. A recent work [Science 375, 418 (2022)] made a remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design. Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.</description>

Abstract: The capability of hydrodynamics to accurately describe slow and long-wavelength fluctuations around non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), characterized by a stationary flow of energy or matter in the presence of a driving force, remains an open question. In this study, we explicitly construct a hydrodynamic description of electrically driven non-equilibrium charged steady states \new{in the limit in which the relaxation of the first non-hydrodynamic excitation is parametrically slow}. Our approach involves introducing gapped modes and extending the effective description into a relaxed hydrodynamic theory (RHT). Leveraging the gauge-gravity duality as a tool for controlled computations within non-equilibrium systems, we establish an ultraviolet complete model for these NESS that confirms the validity of our RHT. In summary, our findings provide a concrete realization of the validity of hydrodynamics beyond thermal equilibrium, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion in bounded domains is a fundamental concept in various fields, including billiard dynamics and random walks on finite lattices, with important applications in physics, ecology and biology. An important universal property related to the average return time to the boundary, the Mean Path Length Theorem (MPLT), has been proposed theoretically and confirmed experimentally in various contexts. In this discussion, we investigate a wide range of mechanisms that lead to deviations from this universal behavior, such as boundary effects, reorientation and memory processes. In particular, this study investigates the dynamics of run-and-tumble particles within a confined two-dimensional circular domain. Through a combination of theoretical approaches and numerical simulations, we validate the MPLT under uniform and isotropic particle inflow conditions. The research demonstrates that although the MPLT is generally applicable for different step length distributions, deviations occur for non-uniform angular distributions, non-elastic boundary conditions or memory processes. These results underline the crucial influence of boundary interactions and angular dynamics on the behaviour of particles in confined spaces. Our results provide new insights into the geometry and dynamics of motion in confined spaces and contribute to a better understanding of a broad spectrum of phenomena ranging from the motion of bacteria to neutron transport. This type of analysis is crucial in situations where inhomogeneity occurs, such as multiple real-world scenarios within a limited domain. This bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical applications in biological and physical systems since the study of the statistics of movement in confined settings can bring some light in explaining the mobility mechanism of active agents.</description>

Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</description>

Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Population Dynamics of Schr\"odinger Cats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an exact equivalence between classical population dynamics and Lindbladian evolution admitting a dark state and obeying a set of certain local symmetries. We then introduce {\em quantum population dynamics} as models in which this local symmetry condition is relaxed. This allows for non-classical processes in which animals behave like Schr\"odinger's cat and enter superpositions of live and dead states, thus resulting in coherent superpositions of different population numbers. We develop a field theory treatment of quantum population models as a synthesis of Keldysh and third quantization techniques and draw comparisons to the stochastic Doi-Peliti field theory description of classical population models. We apply this formalism to study a prototypical ``Schr\"odigner cat'' population model on a $d$-dimensional lattice, which exhibits a phase transition between a dark extinct phase and an active phase that supports a stable quantum population. Using a perturbative renormalization group approach, we find a critical scaling of the Schr\"odinger cat population distinct from that observed in both classical population dynamics and usual quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gr\"uneisen parameter as an entanglement compass and the breakdown of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$, i.e., the singular part of the ratio of thermal expansion to the specific heat, has been broadly employed to explore both finite-$T$ and quantum critical points (QCPs). For a genuine quantum phase transition (QPT), thermal fluctuations are absent and thus the thermodynamic $\Gamma$ cannot be employed. We propose a quantum analogue to $\Gamma$ that computes entanglement as a function of a tuning parameter $\lambda$ and show that QPTs take place only for systems in which the ground-state energy depends on $\lambda$ non-linearly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the breakdown of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem in the thermodynamic limit at any QCP. We showcase our approach using the quantum 1D Ising model with transverse field and Kane's quantum computer. The slowing down of the dynamics and thus the "creation of mass" close to any QCP/QPT is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on machine learning glassy dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the connections between microscopic structure, emergent physical properties, and slow dynamics has long been a challenge when studying the glass transition. The absence of clear visible structural order in amorphous configurations complicates the identification of the key physical mechanisms underpinning slow dynamics. The difficulty in sampling equilibrated configurations at low temperatures hampers thorough numerical and theoretical investigations. This perspective article explores the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to face these challenges, building on the algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision and image recognition. We present recent successful ML applications, as well as many open problems for the future, such as transferability and interpretability of ML approaches. We highlight new ideas and directions in which ML could provide breakthroughs to better understand the fundamental mechanisms at play in glass-forming liquids. To foster a collaborative community effort, this article also introduces the ``GlassBench" dataset, providing simulation data and benchmarks for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional glass-formers. We propose critical metrics to compare the performance of emerging ML methodologies, in line with benchmarking practices in image and text recognition. The goal of this roadmap is to provide guidelines for the development of ML techniques in systems displaying slow dynamics, while inspiring new directions to improve our theoretical understanding of glassy liquids.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Number of States via the Rodeo Algorithm for Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of statistical physics, the number of states in which a system can be realized with a given energy is a key concept that bridges the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of physical systems. For quantum systems, many approaches rely on the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. In this work, we demonstrate how the recently developed rodeo algorithm can be utilized to determine the number of states associated with all energy levels without any prior knowledge of the eigenstates. Quantum computers, with their innate ability to address the intricacies of quantum systems, make this approach particularly promising for the study of the thermodynamics of those systems. To illustrate the procedure's effectiveness, we apply it to compute the number of states of the 1D transverse-field Ising model and, consequently, its specific heat, proving the reliability of the method presented here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general driving protocol for many-body systems to generate a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries. This imprints emergent quasi-conservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to reveal the multipartite entanglement encoded in the full reduced density matrix of microscopic subregion both in spin and fermionic many-body systems. We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement with our two witnesses in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We further establish the singular scaling of general multipartite entanglement measures at criticality, and present an explicit analysis in the tripartite case. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power-law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Entanglement microscopy opens a rich window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure: recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small amount of entanglement, thus deviating from the "maximum-entropy principle" that underpins thermodynamics. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp pseudothermalization transitions.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: IV. Connection of Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Dynamics with the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of the novel phases and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter physics. Thanks to our newly developed bipartite-reweight-annealing algorithm, we can systematically study EE behaviors near both first and second-order phase transition points of two-dimensional strongly correlated systems by scanning the EE across a large parameter region, which was super difficult previously due to the huge computation resources demanded. Interestingly, we find that the EE or its derivative diverges at the critical point, which essentially reveals the phase transition involving discrete or continuous symmetry breaking. What's more, we observe that the peak of the EE curve can detect first-order phase transitions at high symmetry breaking points, separating phases with lower symmetry broken. This behavior also applies to the symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional chequerboard $J-Q$ model, where the emergent higher symmetry arises from the related deconfined criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. This work points to new phenomena and mechanisms that can help us better identify different phase transitions and the underlying symmetry breaking.</description>
