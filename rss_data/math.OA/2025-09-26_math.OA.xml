      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$ . We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable preliminary C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable preliminary C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>

      <title>Rings of non-commutative functions and their fields of fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-free ideal rings, or semifirs, were introduced by Paul M. Cohn to study universal localizations in the non-commutative setting. We provide new examples of semifirs consisting of analytic functions in several non-commuting variables. These examples arise canonically in free analysis by completing the free algebra in the topology of ``uniform convergence on operator-space balls'' in the non-commutative universe of tuples of square matrices of any finite size.
  We show, in particular, that the ring of (uniformly) entire non-commutative (NC) functions in $d \in \mathbb{N}$ non-commuting variables, $\scr{O}_d$, is a semifir. Every finitely--generated right (or left) ideal in $\scr{O}_d$ is closed, which yields an analytic extension of G. Bergman's nullstellensatz for the free algebra. Any semifir admits a universal skew field of fractions; applying this to $\scr{O}_d$ yields the universal skew field of ``NC meromorphic expressions", $\scr{M} _d$. We show that any $f \in \scr{M} _d$ has a well-defined domain and evaluations in a large class of stably-finite topological algebras, including finite $C^*$-algebras, extending a result of Cohn for NC rational functions. As an application, we extend the almost sure convergence result of Haagerup and Thorbj\"ornsen for free polynomials evaluated on tuples of random matrices to the setting of NC meromorphic expressions.</description>

      <title>Kernel Radon-Nikodym Derivatives for Random Matrix Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random operator tuples and random matrix ensembles through positive definite kernels, conditional expectations, and dilation theory. A Radon-Nikodym theorem for kernels is established, showing how domination can be expressed by explicit density operators. For shifted kernels this reduces to simple moment-ratio tests. In bi-unitarily invariant and block-invariant ensembles, these criteria align with classical asymptotics such as the Marchenko-Pastur law, offering a clear and efficient way to detect threshold phenomena.</description>

      <title>Null projections and noncommutative function theory in operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study projections in the bidual of a $C^*$-algebra $B$ that are null with respect to a subalgebra $A$, that is projections $p\in B^{**}$ satisfying $|\phi|(p)=0$ for every $\phi\in B^*$ annihilating $A$. In the separable case, $A$-null projections are precisely the peak projections in the bidual of $A$ at which the subalgebra $A$ interpolates the entire $C^*$-algebra $B$. These are analogues of null sets in classical function theory, on which several profound results rely. This motivates the development of a noncommutative variant, which we use to find appropriate `quantized' versions of some of these classical facts. Through a delicate generalization of a theorem of Varopoulos, we show that, roughly speaking, sufficiently regular interpolation projections are null precisely when their atomic parts are. As an application, we give alternative proofs and sharpenings of some recent peak-interpolation results of Davidson and Hartz for algebras on Hilbert function spaces, also illuminating thereby how earlier noncommutative peak-interpolation theory may be applied. In another direction, given a convex subset of the state space of $B$, we characterize when the associated Riesz projection is null. This is then applied to various important topics in noncommutative function theory, such as the F.&amp; M. Riesz property, the existence of Lebesgue decompositions, the description of Henkin functionals, and Arveson's noncommutative Hardy spaces (maximal subdiagonal algebras).</description>

      <title>Quantum Mycielskians: symmetries, twin vertices and distinguishing labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum generalization of the Mycielski construction for quantum graphs. In particular, we analyze the quantum symmetries of quantum Mycielskians and their relation to the symmetries of the underlying quantum graphs. We introduce a quantum analogue of graphs with twin vertices and show that, for classical graphs with a small number of vertices, this notion reduces to the classical one. Finally, we propose a quantum extension of the distinguishing number and examine its behavior under the quantum Mycielski construction.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion of smooth functions in deterministic and iid Haar unitary matrices, and application to tensor products of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $U^N$ be a family of $N\times N$ independent Haar unitary random matrices and their adjoints, $Z^N$ a family of deterministic matrices, and $P$ a self-adjoint noncommutative polynomial, i.e. for any $N$, $P(U^N,Z^N)$ is self-adjoint, $f$ a smooth function. We prove that for any $k$, if $f$ is smooth enough, there exist deterministic constants $\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)$ such that $$ \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{N}\text{Tr}\left( f(P(U^N,Z^N)) \right)\right]\ =\ \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)}{N^{2i}}\ +\ \mathcal{O}(N^{-2k-2}) .$$ Besides, the constants $\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)$ are built explicitly with the help of free probability. As a corollary, we prove that given $\alpha&lt;1/2$, for $N$ large enough, every eigenvalue of $P(U^N,Z^N)$ is $N^{-\alpha}$-close to the spectrum of $P(u,Z^N)$ where $u$ is a $d$-tuple of free Haar unitaries. We also prove the convergence of the norm of any polynomial $P(U^N\otimes I_M, I_N\otimes Y^M)$ as long as the family $Y^M$ converges strongly and that $M\ll N \ln^{-3}(N)$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Orlicz $*$-algebras on locally elliptic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally elliptic group, $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions, and $\omega: G \rightarrow [1,\infty)$ a weight function on $G$ such that the weighted Orlicz space $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra when equipped with the convolution product and involution $f^*(x):=\overline{f(x^{-1})}$ ($f \in L^\Phi(G,\omega)$). Such a weight always exists on $G$ and we call it an $L^\Phi$-weight. We assume that $1/\omega \in L^\Psi(G)$ so that $L^\Phi(G,\omega) \subseteq L^1(G)$. This paper studies the spectral theory and primitive ideal structure of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$. In particular, we focus on studying the Hermitian, Wiener and $*$-regularity properties on this algebra, along with some related questions on spectral synthesis. It is shown that $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is always quasi-Hermitian, weakly-Wiener and $*$-regular. Thus, if $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is Hermitian, then it is also Wiener. Although, in general, $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is not always Hermitian, it is known that Hermitianness of $L^1(G)$ implies Hermitianness of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ if $\omega$ is sub-additive. We give numerous examples of locally elliptic groups $G$ for which $L^1(G)$ is Hermitian and sub-additive $L^\Phi$-weights on these groups. In the weighted $L^1$ case, even stronger Hermitianness results are formulated.</description>
