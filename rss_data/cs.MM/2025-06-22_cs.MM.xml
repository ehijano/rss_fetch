      <title>ViFusion: In-Network Tensor Fusion for Scalable Video Feature Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale video feature indexing in datacenters is critically dependent on efficient data transfer. Although in-network computation has emerged as a compelling strategy for accelerating feature extraction and reducing overhead in distributed multimedia systems, harnessing advanced networking resources at both the switch and host levels remains a formidable challenge. These difficulties are compounded by heterogeneous hardware, diverse application requirements, and complex multipath topologies. Existing methods focus primarily on optimizing inference for large neural network models using specialized collective communication libraries, which often face performance degradation in network congestion scenarios.
  To overcome these limitations, we present ViFusion, a communication aware tensor fusion framework that streamlines distributed video indexing by merging numerous small feature tensors into consolidated and more manageable units. By integrating an in-network computation module and a dedicated tensor fusion mechanism within datacenter environments, ViFusion substantially improves the efficiency of video feature indexing workflows. The deployment results show that ViFusion improves the throughput of the video retrieval system by 8--22 times with the same level of latency as state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>DT-UFC: Universal Large Model Feature Coding via Peaky-to-Balanced Distribution Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will be released for future research.</description>

      <title>Sonic4D: Spatial Audio Generation for Immersive 4D Scene Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 4D generation have demonstrated its remarkable capability in synthesizing photorealistic renderings of dynamic 3D scenes. However, despite achieving impressive visual performance, almost all existing methods overlook the generation of spatial audio aligned with the corresponding 4D scenes, posing a significant limitation to truly immersive audiovisual experiences. To mitigate this issue, we propose Sonic4D, a novel framework that enables spatial audio generation for immersive exploration of 4D scenes. Specifically, our method is composed of three stages: 1) To capture both the dynamic visual content and raw auditory information from a monocular video, we first employ pre-trained expert models to generate the 4D scene and its corresponding monaural audio. 2) Subsequently, to transform the monaural audio into spatial audio, we localize and track the sound sources within the 4D scene, where their 3D spatial coordinates at different timestamps are estimated via a pixel-level visual grounding strategy. 3) Based on the estimated sound source locations, we further synthesize plausible spatial audio that varies across different viewpoints and timestamps using physics-based simulation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method generates realistic spatial audio consistent with the synthesized 4D scene in a training-free manner, significantly enhancing the immersive experience for users. Generated audio and video examples are available at https://x-drunker.github.io/Sonic4D-project-page.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Image Retrieval via Dual-Vision Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model. However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training. Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.</description>

      <title>GeoGuess: Multimodal Reasoning based on Hierarchy of Visual Information in Street View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.</description>

      <title>Class Agnostic Instance-level Descriptor for Visual Instance Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.</description>

      <title>TextBraTS: Text-Guided Volumetric Brain Tumor Segmentation with Innovative Dataset Development and Fusion Module Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020 benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.
  Our dataset, implementation code, and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Jupitern52/TextBraTS.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Cost of an Image: Quantifying the Energy Consumption of AI Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation. Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution. U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality images also being among the most energy efficient ones.</description>

      <title>Memory-enhanced Retrieval Augmentation for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient long-video understanding~(LVU) remains a challenging task in computer vision. Current long-context vision-language models~(LVLMs) suffer from information loss due to compression and brute-force downsampling. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this issue, their applicability is limited due to explicit query dependency. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel memory-enhanced RAG-based approach called MemVid, which is inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings. Our approach operates in four basic steps: 1) memorizing holistic video information, 2) reasoning about the task's information needs based on memory, 3) retrieving critical moments based on the information needs, and 4) focusing on the retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's memory-grounded reasoning capabilities while achieving optimal end-to-end performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiments, MemVid demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to both LVLMs and RAG methods.</description>

      <title>Video-Mediated Emotion Disclosure: Expressions of Fear, Sadness, and Joy by People with Schizophrenia on YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals with schizophrenia frequently experience intense emotions and often turn to vlogging as a medium for emotional expression. While previous research has predominantly focused on text based disclosure, little is known about how individuals construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences in video blogs. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing 200 YouTube videos created by individuals with schizophrenia. Drawing on media research and self presentation theories, we developed a visual analysis framework to disentangle these videos. Our analysis revealed diverse practices of emotion disclosure through both verbal and visual channels, highlighting the dynamic interplay between these modes of expression. We found that the deliberate construction of visual elements, including environmental settings and specific aesthetic choices, appears to foster more supportive and engaged viewer responses. These findings underscore the need for future large scale quantitative research examining how visual features shape video mediated communication on social media platforms. Such investigations would inform the development of care centered video sharing platforms that better support individuals managing illness experiences.</description>

      <title>Embodied Web Agents: Bridging Physical-Digital Realms for Integrated Agent Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.</description>
