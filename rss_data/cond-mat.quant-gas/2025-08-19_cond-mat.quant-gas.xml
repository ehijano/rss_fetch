      <title>Ideal Fermi gas in the Dunkl formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas within the framework of the Dunkl formalism, which incorporates deformation effects through reflection symmetric differential operators. The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism.</description>

      <title>Dual-species atomic absorption image reconstruction using deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical imaging plays an instrumental role in understanding the behavior of trapped neutral atoms. In this work, we describe a deep learning-based online image completion protocol that reduces interference fringes in optical absorption signals for a dual-species atomic system. Regardless of the distinct nature of the task for two different atomic species, 6Li and 23Na, the method displays a robust solution for suppressing fringes. To incorporate this into daily operations, a transfer learning scheme is required that incrementally updates the previously learned parameters. We outline an online image completion method that efficiently adapts to drifting experimental conditions. Our method can be easily integrated into lab settings, where transfer learning can accelerate image analysis.</description>

      <title>Universal Thermodynamics of Dunkl-Deformed Bose Gases: From Power-Law Traps to Physical Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an ideal Bose gas confined by a $D$-dimensional power-law potential within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. By analyzing the combined effects of spatial dimensionality and trap geometry, we derive universal expressions for the thermodynamic quantities, which depend solely on a single parameter. This reduction reveals the existence of universality classes that apply to any power-law potential, regardless of its specific form.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum scars and engineering subharmonic responses with a two frequency drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a continuous two frequency drive is a versatile and robust protocol to control the lifetime of quantum many body scars and to engineer non-equilibrium phases of driven quantum matter. By modulating the frequency ratio $c$ (any rational number), we systematically explore prethermal features across a broad frequency range. For small integer values of $c$, we observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet Hamiltonian based approach. Furthermore, we exploit this tunability to engineer fractional subharmonic responses, highlighting the potential of two-frequency driving as a theoretical platform for controlling scars, prethermalization, and time crystal-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum nature of gravity in self-bound quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of testing the quantum nature of the gravitational field with an ultracold self-bound quantum droplet of one-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures. To this end, we solve variationally and numerically the underlying generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation which includes the effects of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. We derive the associated generalized uncertainty principle and its corresponding minimal length. The obtained modified uncertainty relation enables us to search for the quantum gravity signatures in both small and large droplets. We place bounds on the parameter using existing experimental data from recent experiment of dilute droplets of potassium. Improved upper bounds on the generalized uncertainty principle parameters are found from our analysis.</description>

      <title>Resonant dynamics of spin cluster in a periodically driven one-dimensional Rydberg lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and non-ergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</description>

      <title>Re-weighting estimator for ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of fictitious identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem constitutes one of the most fundamental obstacles in quantum many-body theory. Recently, it has been suggested to circumvent the sign problem by carrying out path integral simulations with a fictitious quantum statistics variable $\xi$, which allows for a smooth interpolation between the bosonic and fermionic limits [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This $\xi$-extrapolation method has subsequently been applied to a variety of systems and has facilitated the analysis of an x-ray scattering measurement taken at the National Ignition Facility with unprecedented accuracy [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. Yet, it comes at the cost of performing an additional $10-20$ simulations, which, in combination with the required small error bars, can pose a serious practical limitation. Here, we remove this bottleneck by presenting a new re-weighting estimator, which allows the study of the full $\xi$-dependence from a single path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation. This is demonstrated for various observables of the uniform electron gas and also warm dense beryllium. We expect our work to be useful for future PIMC simulations of Fermi systems, including ultracold atoms, electrons in quantum dots, and warm dense quantum plasmas.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic coherence and vorticity in room-temperature polariton condensate confined in a self-assembled perovskite microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation at room temperature offers a promising pathway toward quantum photonic technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence, whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss, confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature, where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The criticality enhanced correlations and susceptibility allow weak periodic driving to induce collective synchronization due to critical slowing down, providing a unique platform to study non-equilibrium order emergence. This establishes a powerful paradigm for investigating non-equilibrium order formation, yet the fundamental mechanisms of critical-point synchronization remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the microwave periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded temporal order in subspace, which triggers synchronization across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent synchronized oscillation is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase-dependent seeding and embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insight into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding.</description>

      <title>Medium-enhanced polaron repulsion in a dilute Bose mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of a small density of bosonic impurities immersed in a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature. Using a rigorous perturbative expansion, we show that the presence of the surrounding medium enhances the repulsion between dressed bosonic impurities (polarons) in the regime of weak interactions. Crucially, this differs from prevailing theories based on Landau quasiparticles, which neglect the possibility of quantum degenerate impurities and predict an exchange-induced attraction. We furthermore show that the polaron-polaron interactions are strongly modified if the medium chemical potential rather than the density is held fixed, such that the medium-induced attraction between thermal impurities becomes twice the expected Landau effective interaction. Our work provides a possible explanation for the differing signs of the polaron-polaron interactions observed in experiments across cold atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors, and it has important implications for theories of quasiparticles and quantum mixtures in general.</description>

      <title>A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Optical response of the supersolid polaron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground-state properties of the supersolid polaron consisting of a neutral impurity immersed in a dipolar supersolid have recently been studied. Here, the optical response of an impurity in a dipolar supersolid is calculated and interpreted in terms of the contributions of the different excitation modes of the supersolid. The optical absorption spectrum reveals the two Van Hove singularities that correspond to the flattening of the two Goldstone modes of the supersolid at the Brillouin zone edge. A single peak is found in the superfluid regime corresponding to the roton minimum which diverges at the transition. We propose the response of an ionic impurity as an experimental probe for the supersolid excitations and show how this technique can be extended to neutral impurities with an electric or magnetic dipole moment.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena, offering tunable interactions and diverse trapping geometries. In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional system of trapped fermionic atoms using the composite boson formalism, which describes pairs of opposite-spin fermions as cobosons (short for composite bosons). By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques.</description>

      <title>Effective Interactions in Quasi-One-Dimensional Dipolar Quantum Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar atoms and molecules provide a flexible quantum simulation platform for studying strongly interacting many-body systems. Determining microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of the simulator is crucial for it to be useful. We study effective interactions emerging in quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) dipolar quantum gases, revealing significant nonuniversal corrections to the commonly used 1D pseudopotential. We demonstrate that a full 3D treatment employing realistic interaction potentials is essential for describing the reduced-dimensional system. Our findings are particularly relevant to experiments probing excited states and nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>Relaxation for massive particles: transport and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlators at finite density and temperature encode important information about a physical system, such as transport and causality. For a massive gas of particles in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory, we provide complete analytic results for all first order transport coefficients, including thermoelectric coefficients. We demonstrate the first complete picture of the complex structure of the correlators as a function of mass, providing an interpretation in terms of the causal structure of lightcones. We provide a simple criterion to extract the effective lightcone velocity from the cut of the retarded correlator.</description>

      <title>$^{88}$Sr Reference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strontium-88 is a versatile atomic species often used in quantum optics, precision metrology, and quantum computing. Consolidated atomic data is essential for the planning, execution, and evaluation of experiments. In this reference, we present physical and optical properties of neutral $^{88}$Sr relevant to these applications. Here we focus on experimental results and supplement these with theoretical values. We present equations to convert values and derive important parameters. Tabulated results include key parameters for commonly used transitions in $^{88}$Sr ($^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^1\mathrm{P}_1$, $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2}$, and $^3\mathrm{P}_{0,1,2} \rightarrow \, ^3\mathrm{S}_1$). This dataset serves as an up-to-date reference for studies involving bosonic $^{88}$Sr.</description>
