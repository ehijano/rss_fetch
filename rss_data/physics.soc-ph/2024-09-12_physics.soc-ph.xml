      <title>Analyzing fisher effort -- Gender differences and the impact of Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fishing is a valuable recreational activity in our society. To assess future fishing activity, identifying variables related to differences in fishing activity, such as gender or Covid-19, is helpful. We conducted a Canada-wide email survey of users of an online fishing platform and analyzed responses with a focus on gender, the impact of Covid-19, and variables directly related to fisher effort. Genders (90.1% male and 9.9% female respondents) significantly differed in demographics, socioeconomic status, and fishing skills but were similar in fishing preferences, fisher effort in terms of trip frequency, and travel distance. For almost half of the fishers, Covid-19 caused a change in trip frequency, determined by the activity level and gender of the fisher. A Bayesian network revealed that travel distance was the main determinant of trip frequency and negatively impacted the fishing activity of 61% of the fishers. Fisher effort was also directly related to fishing expertise. The study shows how online surveys and Bayesian networks can help understand the relationship between fishers' characteristics and activity and predict future fishing trends.</description>

      <title>The Status Quo of Architecture and Its Impact on Urban Management: Christopher Alexander's Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Christopher Alexander offers a critical perspective on the modernist approach to architecture, which he argues has prioritized innovation, abstraction, and mechanistic efficiency at the expense of human-centered and organic values. This shift has led to the proliferation of buildings that, while visually striking, often feel cold, impersonal, and disconnected from the deeper needs of the people who inhabit them. Alexander advocates for a return to timeless architectural principles such as harmony, balance, and a deep connection to the natural and cultural context. He introduces the concept of living structure, which emphasizes creating spaces that resonate with the intrinsic order found in nature and human life, fostering environments that are not only functional and beautiful but also profoundly life-affirming. By challenging the dominance of "iconic" but alienating designs, Alexander calls for a holistic, human-centered approach to architecture-one that prioritizes the well-being of individuals and communities, creating spaces that nurture a sense of place, belonging, and harmony with the world around them.</description>

      <title>Structural Robustness and Vulnerability of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are useful descriptions of the structure of many complex systems. Unsurprisingly, it is thus important to analyze the robustness of networks in many scientific disciplines. In applications in communication, logistics, finance, ecology, biomedicine, and many other fields, researchers have studied the robustness of networks to the removal of nodes, edges, or other subnetworks to identify and characterize robust network structures. A major challenge in the study of network robustness is that researchers have reported that different and seemingly contradictory network properties are correlated with a network's robustness. Using a framework by Alderson and Doyle~\cite{Alderson2010}, we categorize several notions of network robustness and we examine these ostensible contradictions. We survey studies of network robustness with a focus on (1)~identifying robustness specifications in common use, (2)~understanding when these specifications are appropriate, and (3)~understanding the conditions under which one can expect different notions of robustness to yield similar results. With this review, we aim to give researchers an overview of the large, interdisciplinary body of work on network robustness and develop practical guidance for the design of computational experiments to study a network's robustness.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity of temporal interaction networks arises from hyperbolic geometry with time-varying curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-similarity of complex systems has been studied intensely across different domains due to its potential applications in system modeling, complexity analysis, etc., as well as for deep theoretical interest. Existing studies rely on scale transformations conceptualized over either a definite geometric structure of the system (very often realized as length-scale transformations) or purely temporal scale transformations. However, many physical and social systems are observed as temporal interactions among agents without any definitive geometry. Yet, one can imagine the existence of an underlying notion of distance as the interactions are mostly localized. Analysing only the time-scale transformations over such systems would uncover only a limited aspect of the complexity. In this work, we propose a novel technique of scale transformation that dissects temporal interaction networks under spatio-temporal scales, namely, flow scales. Upon experimenting with multiple social and biological interaction networks, we find that many of them possess a finite fractal dimension under flow-scale transformation. Finally, we relate the emergence of flow-scale self-similarity to the latent geometry of such networks. We observe strong evidence that justifies the assumption of an underlying, variable-curvature hyperbolic geometry that induces self-similarity of temporal interaction networks. Our work bears implications for modeling temporal interaction networks at different scales and uncovering their latent geometric structures.</description>

      <title>A review of the structure of street networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review measures of street network structure proposed in the recent literature, establish their relevance to practice, and identify open challenges facing researchers. These measures' empirical values vary substantially across world regions and development eras, indicating street networks' geometric and topological heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.</description>
