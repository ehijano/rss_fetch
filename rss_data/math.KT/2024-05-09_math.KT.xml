      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the magnitude homology of a finite digraph $G$ as a certain subquotient of its path algebra. We use this to prove that the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,\ell}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group for any $\ell$, and to describe its rank. This allows us to give a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_2)$, equivalent to vanishing of ${\rm MH}_{2,\ell}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for $\ell&gt;2.$ Recall that a digraph is called diagonal, if its magnitude homology is concentrated in diagonal degrees. Using the condition $(\mathcal V_2),$ we show that the GLMY-fundamental group of a diagonal (undirected) graph is trivial. In other words, the two-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. Besides, we show that the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is quadratic for any $G.$ To obtain a source of examples of (non-)diagonal digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a simplicial complex $K$. For a combinatorial triangulation $K$ of a piecewise-linear manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a combinatorial triangulation of a closed piecewise-linear manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

      <title>Divided Powers and Derived De Rham Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the formalism of derived divided power algebras, and revisit the theory of derived De Rham and crystalline cohomology in this framework. We characterize derived De Rham cohomology of a derived commutative ring $A$, together with the Hodge filtration on it, in terms of a universal property as the largest filtered divided power thickening of $A$. We show that our approach agrees with A.Raksit's. Along the way, we develop some fundamentals of square-zero extensions and derivations in derived algebraic geometry in connection with derived De Rham cohomology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Steenrod operations and Fukaya categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with quantum cohomology and Fukaya categories of a closed monotone symplectic manifold $X$, where we use coefficients in a field $\mathbf{k}$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. The first main result of this paper is that the quantum Steenrod operations $Q\Sigma$ admit an interpretation in terms of the Fukaya category of $X$, via suitable versions of the open-closed maps. Using this, we show that $Q\Sigma$, whose definition is intrinsic to characteristic $p$, is compatible with certain structures inherited from the quantum connection in characteristic $0$. We then turn to applications of these results. The first application is an arithmetic proof of the unramified exponential type conjecture for $X$ that satisfies Abouzaid's generation criterion over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, which uses a reduction mod $p$ argument. Next, we demonstrate how the categorical perspective provides new tools for computing $Q\Sigma$ beyond the reach of known technology. We also explore potential connections of our work to arithmetic homological mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Construction of the motivic cellular spectrum $\mathbf{KO}^{geo}$ over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a periodic motivic spectrum over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ which when pulled back to any scheme $S$ with $\frac{1}{2}\in\Gamma(S,\mathcal{O}_S)$ is the $HP^1-$spectrum constructed by Panin and Walter. This spectrum $\mathbf{KO}^{geo}$ is constructed using closed subschemes of the Grassmannians $Gr(r,n)$. Using this we show that $\mathbf{KO}^{geo}$ is cellular.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that (higher) gauge theories need, besides their variational phase space data, to be equipped with "flux quantization laws" in generalized differential cohomology, there used to be no general prescription for how to define and construct the resulting flux-quantized phase space stacks.
  In this short note we observe that all higher Maxwell-type equations have solution spaces given by flux densities on a Cauchy surface subject to a higher Gauss law and no further constraint: The metric duality-constraint is all absorbed into the evolution equation away from the Cauchy surface.
  Moreover, we observe that the higher Gauss law characterizes the Cauchy data as flat differential forms valued in a characteristic L-infinity-algebra. Using the recent construction of the non-abelian Chern-Dold character map, this implies that compatible flux quantization laws on phase space have classifying spaces whose rational Whitehead L-infinity algebra is this characteristic one. The flux-quantized higher phase space stack of the theory is then simply the corresponding (generally non-abelian) differential cohomology moduli stack on the Cauchy surface.
  We show how this systematic prescription subsumes existing proposals for flux-quantized phase spaces of vacuum Maxwell theory and of the chiral boson. Moreover, for the case of NS/RR-fields in type II supergravity, the traditional "Hypothesis K" of flux quantization in topological K-theory is naturally implied, without the need, on phase space, for the notorious further duality constraint. Finally, as a genuinely non-abelian example, we consider flux-quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity/M-theory given by unstable differential 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H") and emphasize again that, implemented on Cauchy data, this qualifies as the full phase space without the need for a further duality constraint.</description>
