      <title>When bubbles collide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First order phase transitions (FOPT) in the early Universe can be powerful emitters of both relativistic and heavy particles, upon the collision of ultra-relativistic bubble shells. If the particles coupling to the bubble wall have CP-violating interactions, the same collision process can also create a local lepton or baryon charge. This CP-violation can originate from different channels, which have only been partially addressed in the literature. We present a systematic analysis of the different channels inducing CP-violation during bubble collisions: 1) the decay of heavy particles 2) the production of heavy particles and 3) the production of light and relativistic Standard Model (SM) particles.
  As an illustration of the impact that such mechanisms can have on baryon number and dark matter (DM) abundance, we then introduce a simple model of cogenesis, separating a positive and a negative lepton number in the SM and a dark sector (DS). The lepton number asymmetry in the SM can be used to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), while the opposite asymmetry in the DS is responsible for determining the abundance of DM. Moreover, the masses of light neutrinos can be understood via the inverse seesaw mechanism, with the lepton-violating Majorana mass originating from the FOPT.
  A typical smoking gun signal of this class of models is the irreducible gravitational wave (GW) background produced by the PT. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space can be probed at future observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET).</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production sourced by spectator scalar fields during inflation. These fields, while not driving cosmic expansion, generate blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations that naturally satisfy current CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced power spectra at smaller scales accessible to GW detectors. The resulting GW spectrum spans an exceptionally broad frequency range from $10^{-20}$ to $1$ Hz, with amplitudes ranging from $\Omega_{\text{GW}}h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-12}$ depending on the reheating temperature and spectator field mass. For heavy spectator fields with effective masses near the inflationary Hubble scale $H_I$, the mechanism produces observable signals across multiple detector bands accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and ground-based detectors. Our analysis reveals multiple complementary constraints on spectator field parameters. GW-induced limits on the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$) require $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.61 H_I$, stronger than CMB isocurvature bounds alone ($m_\chi \gtrsim 0.54 H_I$). The non-observation of primordial B-modes by \textit{Planck} provides stronger constraints $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.66 H_I$, with projected LiteBIRD sensitivity potentially reaching $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.70 H_I$. This mechanism enables a unique multi-messenger probe of beyond the Standard Model physics during inflation, providing simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through current and next-generation GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Dark Photon-Photon Tridents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons, hypothesized to be sufficiently light and/or weakly interacting, offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Their decay into three photons, referred to as the "dark photon trident" process, becomes the dominant channel when the dark photon mass lies below the electron pair production threshold. This decay channel produces a significant flux of x-rays, presenting an opportunity for indirect detection. In this study, we analyze 16 years of x-ray data from INTEGRAL/SPI to investigate sub-MeV dark photon decay. By incorporating state-of-the-art astrophysical background modeling and accounting for the full one-loop decay amplitude, we achieve world-leading constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon masses in the range of 61-1022 keV. These results represent a significant improvement over previous constraints, narrowing the parameter space for viable dark photon dark matter models. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of x-ray observatories to probe unexplored regions of parameter space and pave the way for future searches using next-generation instruments designed to detect faint astrophysical signals.</description>

      <title>Four-Loop Renormalisation of Chiral Gauge Theories with Non-Anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in the BMHV Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the complete 4-loop renormalisation of an Abelian chiral gauge theory in the Breitenlohner-Maison / `t Hooft-Veltman (BMHV) scheme. Employing a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularisation, we determine the full set of symmetry restoring counterterms from the quantum action principle. Our calculation represents the highest-order application of the BMHV framework so far, pushing the limits of a self-consistent treatment of $\gamma_5$ at the multi-loop level. We describe the computational setup that we developed to perform the computations and discuss key implementation aspects, such as the BMHV algebra and tensor reduction. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of applying the BMHV scheme at high loop orders and establishes a solid foundation for future studies of high-precision electroweak physics.</description>

      <title>Study of anisotropic flow of heavy hadrons in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV using HYDJET++ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the anisotropic flow of heavy hadrons ($D^{0}$, $D^{\pm}$, and $\Lambda_{c}$) in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV using the HYDJET++ model is presented. This study aims to explore the collective behavior and thermalization of charm hadrons at RHIC energy. The modeling of anisotropic flow is performed using a centrality-dependent parameterization of anisotropic parameters. Our model results are consistent with STAR experimental results up to $p_{T} = 4$ GeV/c. It captures the centrality-dependent shifts of the flow peak towards lower $p_{T}$ as collisions become more peripheral. This shift is attributed to the weaker radial flow in peripheral collisions. The model also reproduces important features such as the number-of-constituent-quark scaling, mass ordering, and baryon-meson grouping, all consistent with experimental observations. Furthermore, we present comparisons with other models, like DUKE, SUBATECH, TAMU, and AMPT. Overall, our results highlight the efficacy of HYDJET++ in describing the collective dynamics of heavy-flavor hadrons in the quark-gluon plasma medium.</description>

      <title>Impact on $L$-observables of a new combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of a combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors on a set of $L$-observables. The $L$-observables are constructed from ratios of branching fractions in $B_{s}\to VV,PP,PV$ versus $B_d \to VV,PP,PV$ decays with $P=K^0,\bar{K}^0$ and $V=K^{*0},\bar{K}^{*0}$, thereby partially reducing their hadronic uncertainties. We show the change of the Standard Model predictions of the $L$-observables under different determinations of the ratio of the relevant form factors (with correlations) including lattice QCD data and a novel light-cone sum rule analysis. In addition, we provide precise results for all $B_{d,s} \to K^{(*)}$ form factors in machine-readable files. We find that the inclusion of our up-to-date results, as well as the use or omission of lattice QCD data for the form factors, has a significant impact on the $L$-observables. We also discuss how the New Physics interpretation is affected by the updated form factors and present revised predictions for the mechanism identified in our analysis of $B \to VP$ decays, now employing more suitable new experimental observables defined in this paper.</description>

      <title>Implications of DESI for Dark Matter &amp; Cosmic Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Dark matter spikes with strongly self-interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unavoidable prediction of scenarios with Dark Matter (DM) self-interactions is the existence of number changing processes that convert $n$ initial DM particles into $m$ final ones ($n\to m$ processes), possibly accompanied by Standard Model particles. We argue that the $n\rightarrow m$ processes could be probed in DM spikes at the center of galaxies, where the high density may allow sizable rates. We systematically study the implications of the $n \to m$ processes in DM spikes, including other possible interactions involving DM, such as annihilation and self-scattering. We find that for $n\geq3$, the spike is significantly depleted for $n\to m$ cross-sections favored by DM production via thermal freeze-out. On the other hand, the semi-annihilation of two DM particles into one DM particle and one Standard Model particle preserves in general the structure of the spike. Such density modifications significantly affect phenomenological studies of both astrophysics and particle DM processes around DM spikes.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium real-time dynamics and transport coefficients in Light-Front Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Light-Front Holographic QCD (LFHQCD) to investigate non-equilibrium real-time dynamics and transport properties of strongly coupled QCD matter. While LFHQCD has been successfully applied to hadronic spectroscopy and parton distributions, its potential for modeling transport phenomena remains unexplored. We develop a light-front framework to compute key transport coefficients-such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and the jet quenching parameter-by introducing finite-temperature and density effects via holographic black brane backgrounds and incorporating metric fluctuations in the AdS bulk. Using the light-front Schrodinger equation with temperature-modified effective potentials, we derive analytic and numerical results for the dissipative response functions of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma. Our approach leverages the Minkowski-space wavefunctions of LFHQCD, enabling real-time modeling of pre-equilibrium and thermalization dynamics inaccessible to Euclidean lattice simulations. This study opens a new frontier in holographic QCD phenomenology and offers testable predictions relevant to heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.</description>

      <title>Particle Masses Spectrum from Harmonic Cascade Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parameter-free framework, Recognition Science (RS), that predicts the full spectrum of Standard-Model particle masses from first principles. The derived mass formula $m(n,d,s,g) = m_0 \cdot (X_{opt})^{n} \cdot (X_{opt})^{R_{RS}} \cdot E(d,s,g)$ prescribes to each particle a discrete harmonic lattice site $n$ involving only geometric constants: the optimal recognition scale $X_{opt} = \phi/\pi$, a resonance index $R_{RS} = 7/12$, the Planck-derived base mass $m_0$, and an efficiency factor $E(d,s,g)$ that depends on interaction dimensionality $d$, spin $s$ and generation $g$. Simple ratios 7/8, 5/6 and 12/13 link neighboring lattice sites and explain electromagnetic, force-matter and generational splittings, respectively. The mass formula reproduces all measured lepton, quark, meson and baryon masses to better than 0.1% and resolves the long-standing bottom-quark anomaly via a naturally emerging recognition boundary at $n \approx 60.7$. RS also predicts concrete and testable masses for yet-undiscovered states.</description>

      <title>Tri-hypercharge versus tri-darkcharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal, ultraviolet-complete, and renormalizable extension of the Standard Model, in which the three generations of ordinary fermions are distinguished by family-dependent hypercharges, while three right-handed neutrinos are separated by a dark gauge symmetry that is trivial for all Standard Model fields. This setup yields a fully flipped inert doublet model. The model naturally realizes a hybrid scotoseesaw mechanism that accounts for the smallness of neutrino masses and the largeness of lepton mixing. Simultaneously, it explains the stability and relic abundance of dark matter through a residual dark parity and addresses the hierarchies of charged fermion masses and the suppression of quark mixing via higher-dimensional operators involving high-scale scalar singlets and vector-like fermions. We explore the phenomenological implications of the model and derive constraints from electroweak precision tests, collider searches, flavor-changing processes, and observations of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Studying Maximal Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to test quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By computing the spin correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced via photon-gluon fusion, we find that longitudinally polarized photons produce maximal entanglement at leading order, while transversely polarized photons generate significant entanglement near the threshold and in the ultra-relativistic regime. Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality. This study extends entanglement measurements to the EIC, presenting new opportunities to explore the interplay of quantum information phenomena and hadronic physics in the EIC era.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Realistic Intersecting D6-Brane Model with positive and negative {\mu} Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of current constraints from supersymmetry (SUSY) searches within the LHC, as well as findings from direct dark matter detection experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), we revisit the three-family Pati-Salam model derived from intersecting D6-branes in Type IIA string theory compactified on the $T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold, known for its realistic low-energy phenomenology. Since the muon anomalous magnetic moment might be in accordance with the Standard Model prediction, we conduct a comprehensive scan over the model's parameter space for each sign of the Higgsino mass parameter, $\mu &lt; 0$ and $\mu &gt; 0$. We find that the gravitino mass is typically greater than 1.5 TeV in both scenarios while simultaneously satisfying the LHC SUSY bounds, B-physics observables, and the Higgs mass constraint. Within the experimentally viable region of the parameter space, the sparticle mass spectra fall within the following ranges: gluinos lie in the range 2-18 TeV; first- and second-generation squarks and sleptons span 3-16 TeV and 1-6 TeV, respectively. For third-generation sfermions, the lightest stop, which can satisfy the dark matter relic density via neutralino-stop coannihilation consistent with the \textit{Planck} 5$\sigma$ bounds, has a mass in the range 0.5-1.2 TeV. The lightest neutralino can be as heavy as 2.9 TeV. Additionally, the lightest stau can be as light as 200 GeV or as heavy as 5.2 TeV. We identify several viable mechanisms, including multiple coannihilation channels and resonance mechanisms, by which the observed dark matter relic abundance is successfully realized.</description>

      <title>Unitarity-Conserving Non-Minimally Coupled Inflation and the ACT Spectral Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $ n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034 $. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of non-minimally coupled inflation models such as Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$. Here we revisit the unitarity-conserving non-minimally coupled inflation model proposed in [1]. We show that when the inflaton is a complex non-minimally coupled gauge singlet scalar with additional interactions in the Jordan frame to maintain unitarity, the model predicts $n_s = 0.9730$ and $r \approx 9 \times 10^{-6}$ for scalar self-coupling $\lambda = 0.1$.</description>

Abstract: While gluon fusion dominates Higgs pair production at the LHC, vector boson fusion (VBF) offers a unique window into Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics through its distinctive kinematic features and direct sensitivity to Higgs-vector boson interactions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of double Higgs production via VBF in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), systematically investigating how dimension-6 and dimension-8 bosonic operators - particularly those involving field derivatives - can enhance the production rate. We identify the most relevant Wilson coefficients (WCs) affecting the trilinear Higgs coupling ($hhh$) and Higgs-vector boson interactions ($hVV$, $hhVV$). Using constraints from global fits and interpolating fit results for unconstrained WCs with Naive Dimensional Analysis, we assess their effects on the $VV \to hh$ ($V = W,Z$) scattering amplitudes and cross-sections. Our analysis includes a study of EFT convergence and validity in models with scalar extensions of the SM. Numerical simulations for the planned High-Luminosity LHC experiment (HL-LHC) in general reveal only a modest and challenging to detect enhancement of the VBF di-Higgs production rate over the SM prediction. However, we show that in optimistic scenarios, such a process could be observed at the HL-LHC. In certain cases, when the enhancement is dominated by the dimension-6 or dimension-8 operators containing field derivatives (and thus leading to stronger energy-dependent effects), this channel becomes competitive with di-Higgs production via gluon fusion. This work highlights the role of VBF di-Higgs production as a complementary channel for probing anomalous Higgs couplings and their impact on BSM physics.</description>

      <title>Proposed measurement of longitudinally polarised vector bosons in $WH$ and $ZH$ production at Hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal polarisation states of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons arise during electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking as the vector bosons absorb the Higgs boson's massless degrees of freedom. Consequently, these states are intrinsically linked to the EW symmetry breaking mechanism. Measuring the Higgs boson's coupling to them thus offers a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of EW symmetry breaking and potentially opens a window to physics beyond the Standard Model. This work studies vector boson polarisation in associated $WH$ and $ZH$ production at the LHC, proposing analysis strategies for their measurement. We explore kinematic and angular observables and employ machine learning to optimise the separation between the longitudinal and transverse polarisation states. Furthermore, we perform a statistical analysis to assess the feasibility of observing longitudinally polarised $W^\pm$ or $Z$ boson production in association with a Higgs boson ($W^\pm_\mathrm{L}H$ and $Z_\mathrm{L}H$) in the $\ell^\pm\nu \gamma\gamma$ and $\ell^\pm\ell^\mp\gamma\gamma$ final states at the LHC. Our studies forecast that $W^\pm_\mathrm{L}H$ production could be measured by the LHC experiments with $&gt;5.0\sigma$ significance using 300 fb$^{-1}$ of 14\,TeV proton-proton collision data. We project inclusive $W^\pm_\mathrm{L}H$ cross section measurement precisions of approximately $30\%$, $15\%$, and $10\%$ with 300 fb$^{-1}$, 1000 fb$^{-1}$, and 3000 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. For $Z_\mathrm{L}H$ production, we forecast a measurement reaching $\sim3.4\sigma$ significance and $35\%$ precision with 3000 fb$^{-1}$. Based on these results, we recommend repeating these studies using LHC data.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and QCD instanton vacuum in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model of the universe, lambdaCDM, is based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with flat 3-dim coordinate space and Friedmann equations. The cosmological constant lambda is providing the cancellations of the matter fields contributions in the flat space. The dynamical dark energy is appearing on over of the vacuum energy of matter fields at the flat space. Within the Standard Model the gluon Yang-Mills (YM) fields are playing the special role since specific properties of their vacuum, where the presence of the gluon condensate, provide the flat space nonperturbative vacuum energy. It is natural to apply the successful instanton liquid model (ILM) of the QCD vacuum and its lowest excitations. Our aim is to calculate the gluon YM fields contribution to the dark energy density. The result of the calculations is corresponding lambdaCDM. We find the equation-of-state parameters w_0=-1, w_a=0 in accordance with lambdaCDM, while the newest data give them at least in the range -0.91 &lt;w_0&lt; -0.73, -1.05&lt; w_a &lt;-0.65 requesting non-acceptable value of scalar glueball mass m to be very small and comparable with present value of Hubble constant H0.</description>

      <title>The $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing and its application in the $B^+/D^+/D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we take into account the intrinsic charm and gluonic contents into the $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing scheme and formulate the tetramixing $\eta-\eta^\prime-G-\eta_c$ to study the mixing properties of $\eta^{(\prime)}$ mesons. Using the newly derived mixing parameters, we calculate the transition form factors (TFFs) of $B^+/D^+/D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}$ within the QCD light-cone sum rules up to next-to-leading order QCD corrections and twist-4 contributions. Using the extrapolated TFFs, we then calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the semi-leptonic decays $B^+/D^+/D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$. Our results are consistent with the recent Belle and BES-III measurements within reasonable errors.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Conversion in Magnetospheres of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion-converted-photons flux is a principal window for searching QCD axions as a dark matter (DM) candidate. In addition to solving the strong CP problem, these may explain the properties of the mysterious DM. Neutron star (NS) cooling by neutrino/axion emissions rate constrains the astrophysical properties of superdense matter. We attempt to analyse the impact of strong magnetic fields on the emission properties of NS by employing the FPS equation of State (EoS). We use the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations by considering effects of strong fields and generating profiles. We assume Cooper-pair-breaking formation (PBF) and the Bremsstrahlung process occur in the core of NS. We adopt a polynomial fit function of radial profile to analyse the effects of strong magnetic field. Our entire analysis is at an axion mass of $15$ meV and central magnetic field $B_{c}$=$10^{17}$ G. Our work assumes the core comprises hadronic matter of the spherically symmetric magnetized NSs. We have present the results for the energy spectrum of axions and their subsequent conversion to photons. We show that the cooling rate and the luminosity of axions for NSs change significantly due to the intense magnetic field. We report that the energy spectrum of axions from the Bremsstrahlung process dominates over the PBF process at lesser axion energies, within the possible axion mass range for PSR J1356-6429 NS. Our results reveal that the impact of the magnetic field is less at lower axion energies, indicating the necessity for including a magnetic field in axion-to-photon conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Triplet Higgs assisted leptogenesis from axion oscillation after inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptogenesis via axion oscillation after inflation is an alternate mechanism of thermal leptogenesis. In this mechanism, the requirement of the existence of a lepton number ($L$) violating process in equilibrium to drive the lepton number requires the temperature of leptogenesis at $\sim 10^{13}$ GeV. Triplet scalars, due to their interaction with gauge bosons, make a suitable candidate to prevail in the thermal bath via gauge scattering at such high energy. Also, owing to its interaction with Standard Model (SM) leptons and the Higgs scalar, it can mediate $\Delta L =2$ process. Moreover, just one triplet is enough to serve the purpose as opposed to thermal leptogenesis, where at least one more triplet scalar/right-handed neutrino is required to generate a sizable $CP$ violation. In this work, we study a model where the SM gauge group is extended with $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$, with the addition of one Higgs doublet, one scalar triplet, and one complex scalar singlet. The presence of a complex scalar singlet decouples the PQ symmetry breaking from the electroweak scale. It also provides a common source of an axion-like particle and seesaw scale. The scalar triplet offers a common link between leptogenesis via axion oscillation and neutrino mass. Further, with the presence of one triplet scalar, the lepton flavor violation process is directly determined from low-energy neutrino oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Flavoured jet algorithms: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate identification of heavy-flavour jets, those which originate from bottom or charm quarks, is crucial for precision studies of the Standard Model and searches for new physics. However, assigning flavour to jets presents significant challenges, primarily due to issues with infrared and collinear (IRC) safety. This paper aims to address these challenges by evaluating recently-proposed jet algorithms designed to be IRC-safe and applicable in high-precision measurements. We compare these algorithms across benchmark heavy-flavour production processes and kinematic regimes that are relevant for LHC phenomenology. Exploiting both fixed-order calculations in QCD as well as parton shower simulations, we analyse the infrared sensitivity of these new algorithms at different stages of the event evolution and compare to flavour-labelling strategies currently adopted by LHC collaborations. The results highlight that, while all algorithms lead to more robust flavour-assignments compared to current techniques, they vary in performance depending on the observable and energy regime. The study lays groundwork for robust, flavour-aware jet analyses in current and future collider experiments to maximise the physics potential of experimental data by reducing discrepancies between theoretical and experimental methods.</description>

      <title>Can Effective $4-$Quark Operators Describe Signals of a Supersymmetric Diquark Model at the LHC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constrained by current LHC data. Supposedly extensions of the Standard Model (SM) involving heavy particles can be constrained by matching onto the SMEFT. However, the reliability of these indirect constraints compared to those derived directly from the UV model remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate whether $4-$quark operators can accurately capture the effects of an $R-$parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetric model on the production of pairs of top quarks, for parameters that satisfy all known constraints and lead to measurable effects. We assume that the sbottom is the lightest supersymmetric particle and focus on its interaction with a light quark and a top quark; the sbottom thus acts like a specific diquark. The $4-$quark operators arise by integrating out the sbottom at tree level. We analyze measurements of inclusive top pair production by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. We find that the $4-$quark operators can accurately describe the RPV model's effects only for very heavy sbottom squarks, where the effects are well below the sensitivity of LHC experiments for all values of the RPV coupling that satisfy unitarity constraints. Therefore present or near-future bounds on this RPV model can not be derived from SMEFT analyses.</description>

      <title>Connecting dilaton thermal fluctuation with the Polyakov loop at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the character of the deconfinement phase transition is one of the fundamental challenges in particle physics. In this work, we derive a formula for the expectation value of the Polyakov loop -- the order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition -- in pure $\mathrm{SU(N_{\mathrm{c}})}$ gauge systems at finite temperatures starting from the Coleman\textendash Weinberg-type effective potential encoding the trace anomaly of QCD. Our results are in good agreement with the Lattice QCD data and can effectively describe the large-$N_{\mathrm{c}}$ behaviors of the expectation value of the Polyakov loop. Notably, our findings predict the strongest first-order deconfinement phase transition as $N_{\mathrm{c}} \to +\infty$. Furthermore, to establish a relation between the dilaton field and the Polyakov loop, we also derive the scale transformation rule for temperature based on quantum statistical mechanics. The results of this work may shed a light on the connection between deconfinement phase transition and evolution of scale symmetry in the thermal system.</description>

      <title>Joint analysis of reactor and accelerator CE$\nu$NS data on germanium: implications for the Standard Model and nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first comprehensive joint analysis of all available Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data on germanium: those observed at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) by the COHERENT collaboration and those of the nuclear reactors revealed by the CONUS+ experiment using germanium detectors. In addition to COHERENT and CONUS+, we incorporate reactor data from TEXONO and $\nu$GeN, thereby enhancing both the statistical significance and the systematic reliability of our study. We provide state-of-the-art determinations of key nuclear physics and Standard Model parameters, including the neutron root-mean-square (rms) radius of germanium nuclei, the weak mixing angle, and the neutrino charge radius. The observed tension of about $2 \sigma$ between the COHERENT germanium measurement and the Standard Model prediction motivates a detailed reassessment of the theoretical cross-section. In particular, we examine the impact of nuclear form factors and uncertainties in the nuclear radius, as well as the potential influence of a systematic shift in the neutrino flux normalisation at the SNS. Our results highlight the reliability of CE$\nu$NS as a precision tool, reinforced by the complementarity of different experimental inputs, and lay the groundwork for future advances in the field.</description>

      <title>Global QCD analysis of spin PDFs in the proton with high-$x$ and lattice constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <title>Global fits and the 95 GeV diphoton excesses in the Supersymmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the ATLAS and CMS experiments have reported modest excesses in the diphoton channel at around 95 GeV.~A number of recent studies have examined whether these could be due to an extended electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) sector, including the well known Georgi-Machacek (GM) model.~Here we examine whether the excesses can be explained by a light exotic Higgs boson in the \emph{Supersymmetric} GM (SGM) model which has the same scalar spectrum as the conventional GM model, but with a more constrained Higgs potential and the presence of custodial Higgsino fermions.~We perform a global fit of the SGM model including all relevant production and decay channels, some of which have been neglected in previous studies, which severely constrain the parameter space.~We find that the SGM model can fit the data if the LHC diphoton excesses at 95\,GeV are due to the lightest custodial singlet Higgs boson which contributes $(5-7)\%$ to EWSB, but \emph{cannot} accommodate the LEP $b\bar{b}$ excess, in contrast to other recent studies of the GM model.~Since the SGM model has a highly constrained Higgs potential, the rest of the mass spectrum is sharply predicted, allowing for targeted searches at the LHC or future colliders.~We also compare the SGM model with the non-supersymmetric GM model and identify how they can be distinguished at the LHC or future colliders.</description>

      <title>CALICO: Computing Annihilators from Linear Identities Constraining (differential) Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the method of parametric annihilators for deriving integral relations. Parametric annihilators are differential operators that annihilate multivalued integration kernels appearing in suitable integral representations of special functions. We illustrate this approach in a way that applies to a broad variety of integral representations. We describe a method for computing parametric annihilators based on efficient linear solvers and use them to derive relations between a wide class of special functions related to important problems in high-energy physics. We also formulate a similar method for deriving differential equations satisfied by the independent integrals within an integral family. We show applications to several classes of special functions, including hypergeometric functions, loop integrals in various representations (including Baikov, loop-by-loop Baikov, Lee-Pomeransky and Schwinger representations) and duals of loop integrals. We finally present the public Mathematica package CALICO for computing parametric annihilators and its usage in several examples of high relevance in theoretical particle physics.</description>

Abstract: The STAR experiment at the top RHIC energy has observed that the directed flow ($v_1$) of inclusive light hadrons is independent of the collision system size at a given centrality~\cite{STAR:2008jgm}. However, recent STAR measurements indicate a system-size dependence in the $v_1(y)$-slope ($dv_{1}/dy$) of protons, antiprotons, and their differences ($\Delta dv_{1}/dy$) at a given centrality, suggesting a potential influence of baryon production and transport mechanisms~\cite{Taseer:SQM2024talk}. We have studied pseudorapidity ($dN/dy$) distributions and directed flow ($v_1$ and $dv_{1}/dy$) for pions, kaons, and protons in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 19.6$ GeV using the A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. Specifically, we investigated the influence of string junction parameters in AMPT via the PYTHIA/JETSET routines, focusing on the popcorn mechanism and string-splitting parameters, on $dN/dy$, $dv_{1}/dy$, and their charge-dependent splittings ($\Delta dN/dy$ and $\Delta dv_{1}/dy$). We observe that string junction parameters can affect $dN/dy$, $dv_{1}/dy$, $\Delta dN/dy$, and $\Delta dv_{1}/dy$ for $\pi$, K, and p, and influence their system-size dependence. The effect is most prominent on the $v_1$ of protons, non-trivial for kaons, while the pions $v_1$ remain largely unchanged. These findings provide insights into the interplay between particle production mechanisms, baryon transport, and directed flow in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Improved Ground State Estimation in Quantum Field Theories via Normalising Flow-Assisted Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Compton amplitude and Contact term(s) in the Spinor Helicity formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, contact terms play an important role in ensuring gauge invariance. In the spinor helicity formalism, the choice of a gauge-fixing condition manifests itself in the form of the choice of reference vector to write the massless polarization vector(s). However, this choice must be irrelevant in any gauge-invariant observable. We use this principle to determine contact term for Electromagnetic Compton amplitude. We considered three-point function between two massive particles \&amp; a photon to be one which is responsible for soft photon theorem/Coulomb and demonstrate that it is possible to use the above-mentioned principle to find the contact term for the tree-level Compton amplitude of two bosonic massive spinning particles and two photons. The final result does not suffer from any spurious poles.</description>

      <title>Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>From Explicit Diffeomorphism Breaking to Spontaneous Unimodularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution investigates modifications of General Relativity that allow or mimic energy nonconservation. We focus on Unimodular Gravity (UG), a theory that explicitly breaks diffeomorphism invariance, and show that it can lead to particle acceleration, opening the door to experimental constraints. We also argue that UG admits a well-posed initial value formulation, despite the presence of nondynamical structures. Finally, we introduce a simple model that spontaneously mimics UG, but in which a cosmological constant cannot arise as an integration constant.</description>

      <title>On the Renormalization Group flow of distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization Group flows relate the values of couplings at different scales. Here, we go beyond the Renormalization Group flow of individual trajectories and derive an evolution equation for a distribution on the space of couplings. This shift in perspective can provide new insights, even in theories for which the Renormalization Group flow of individual couplings is well understood. As a first application, we propagate errors under the Renormalization Group flow. Characteristic properties of an error distribution, such as its maximum or highest density region, cannot be propagated at the level of individual couplings, but require our evolution equation for the distribution on the space of couplings. We demonstrate this by calculating the most probable value for the metastability scale in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model. Our second application is the emergence of structure in sets of couplings. We discover that infrared-attractive fixed points do not necessarily attract the maximum of the distribution when the Renormalization Group is evolved over a finite range of scales. Instead, sharply peaked maxima can build up at coupling values that cannot be inferred from individual trajectories. We demonstrate this emergence of structure for the Standard Model, starting from a broad distribution at the Planck scale. The Renormalization Group flow favors the phenomenological ordering of third-generation Yukawa couplings and, strikingly, we find that the most probable values for the Abelian hypercharge and Higgs quartic coupling lie close to their observed values.</description>

      <title>Regular Spacetimes in the Effective Metric Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, significant effort has been directed towards developing various regularized models for compact objects. Recently, a new observable-based parametrization was introduced to account for black hole deformations in a model-independent fashion, referred to as the Effective Metric Description (EMD) \cite{Binetti:2022xdi, DelPiano:2023fiw, DelPiano:2024gvw, DelPiano:2024nrl}. In this paper, we carry out a systematic investigation of the regularity of static and spherically symmetric spacetimes by extending the EMD. We derive the conditions under which curvature scalars remain finite everywhere and the associated spacetime is geodesically complete. Our results are then used to classify the cores of regular spacetimes based on their asymptotic behavior near the origin. To illustrate our findings, we apply our regularity conditions to known black hole examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses from the DESI collaboration suggest that the dark energy density of the Universe may be decreasing with time, slowing the acceleration of the scale factor $a$. Typically these studies are performed assuming an ansatz for the equation of state $w(a)$. In this work, we instead consider simple models of a scalar quintessence potential with linear and quadratic behavior, which could be more representative of real models than particular parametrizations of $w(a)$. We observe a significant preference for dynamical dark energy when using supernova data from DESY5 along with DESI BAO and Planck data, at the cost of slightly exacerbating the Hubble tension. However, when using supernova data from Pantheon+ or Union3, we find only a mild preference for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we study the evolution of energy density fluctuations in the presence of a static and uniform magnetic field. By numerically solving the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation within the relaxation time approximation and performing the momentum mode analysis of different wavelength fluctuations, we show that the magnetic field increases the damping of mode oscillations. This causes a qualitative change in the fluctuations present in the system at the timescale required to achieve a local equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality in a relativistic Yukawa theory with Luttinger fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a Yukawa model featuring a dynamical scalar field coupled to relativistic Luttinger fermions. Using the functional renormalization group (RG) as well as large-$N_{\text{f}}$ or perturbative expansions, we observe the emergence of an infrared attractive partial fixed point in all interactions at which all couplings become RG irrelevant. At the partial fixed point, the scalar mass parameter is RG marginal, featuring a slow logarithmic running towards the regime of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The long-range behavior of the model is characterized by mass gap formation in the scalar and the fermionic sector independently of the initial conditions. Most importantly, a large scale separation between the low-energy scales and the microscopic scales, e.g., a high-energy cutoff scale, is naturally obtained for generic initial conditions without the need for any fine-tuning. We interpret the properties of our model as a relativistic version of self-organized criticality, a phenomenon observed in specific statistical or dynamical systems. This entails natural scale separation and universal long-range observables. We determine nonperturbative estimates for the latter including the scalar and fermionic mass gaps.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of a light beta-radioactive ion using a compact ion trap by adapting the "frozen-spin" method. The measurement will be done on ions stripped of their valence electrons, thereby bypassing the significant Schiff screening that hinders the application of successful contemporary EDM searches using heavy neutral atoms and molecules to light nuclei. We identified $^8$Li as the most promising candidate for a proof-of-concept EDM search and we estimate that the current indirect proton EDM limit of a few $10^{-25} e\cdot$cm set by $^{199}$Hg measurements can be surpassed with a week of measurement time at existing facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pion condensation in ultra-relativistic collisions presents a compelling theoretical phenomenon with significant implications for the dynamics of hadronic matter. Various theoretical frameworks offer insight into the nature of high-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The present study investigates the dissipative behavior of a relativistic pion gas undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Further, we obtain viscosity ($\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\zeta$), and speed of sound ($c_s$) by employing the Boltzmann transport equation with the relaxation time approximation. Findings show a substantial drop in $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ with the fractional increase in condensation. This effect is becoming more evident in larger systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. Alongside the reduction in viscosities, the speed of sound also decreases with increasing condensation, indicating a softening of the equation of state. The analysis of finite-size effects reveals that larger systems exhibit more pronounced signatures of BEC. These results suggest that pion condensation can influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions, with consequential implications for interpreting collective flow observables and the underlying equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. Power counting suggests that our theory could be renormalised in all orders of perturbative expansion. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell nonlocality with bottom-quark pairs at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in Quantum Mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders via processes of fundamental particle scattering. In fact, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured entanglement using top-quark pairs produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Recently, it was shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC, despite the fact that bottom quarks, unlike top quarks, hadronize before decaying. Here, we demonstrate that quantum correlations can also be studied using bottom-quark pairs, and analyze the feasibility of the observation of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in several collider experiments. Given the low mass of the bottom quark relative to typical energies accessible at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with the LHC Run 2 data, especially with the CMS $B$ parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a Heavy Neutral Lepton at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04340v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy lepton singlets $N$ slightly mixed with a standard neutrino $\nu_\ell$ are usually searched for at the LHC in the trilepton plus $p_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ channel: $pp \to W^+ \to \ell^+ N$ with $N\to \ell^- W^+ \to \ell^- \ell'^+ \nu$. We show that, although the longitudinal momentum of the final $\nu$ escapes detection, the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed. While this possibility has not been considered in recent LHC searches, we find that the search for a mass peak could systematically improve the current collider bounds on the mixing $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ for any mass $m_N\ge M_W$.</description>

      <title>Reduction to master integrals and transverse integration identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduction of Feynman integrals to a basis of linearly independent master integrals is a pivotal step in loop calculations, but also one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we assess the impact of using transverse integration identities for the reduction to master integrals. Given an integral family, some of its sectors correspond to diagrams with fewer external legs or to diagrams that can be factorized as products of lower-loop integrals. Using transverse integration identities, i.e. a tensor decomposition in the subspace that is transverse to the external momenta of the diagrams, one can map integrals belonging to such sectors and their subsectors to (products of) integrals belonging to new and simpler integral families, characterized by either fewer generalized denominators, fewer external invariants, fewer loops or combinations thereof. Integral reduction is thus drastically simpler for these new families. We describe a proof-of-concept implementation of the application of transverse integration identities in the context of integral reduction. We include some applications to cutting-edge integral families, showing significant improvements over traditional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Probing $B^+ \to K^+$ semi-leptonic FCNC decay with new physics effects under PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Belle II Collaboration reported the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu})=(2.3\pm0.7)\times10^{-5}$ with a significance of $3.5\sigma$, which is $2.7\sigma$ above the SM expectation. Motivated by this measurement, we calculate this decay channel at the NLO and twist-3 level using the PQCD approach. By combining the lattice QCD data and our results, we obtain form factors with improved accuracy. Using these form factors, we precisely estimate the branching ratios of $B^+ \to K^+$ semileptonic FCNC decays, including $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ and $B^+ \to K^+\ell^+\ell^-$. To explain the anomalies in these two processes, we introduce a leptoquark model as a new physics scenario. Using five possible types of leptoquarks, we successfully explain the latest experimental measurements, and further constraints on the leptoquarks are derived.</description>

      <title>Scattering with total depletion in strong, focussed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical approaches to QED scattering in strong fields typically treat the field as a fixed background with simple spacetime dependence, such as a plane wave. Two major challenges are therefore the inclusion of backreaction (e.g. depletion of the field) and spatial geometry (e.g. focussing). We show here that a solution to one problem can solve the other: even if particle wavefunctions in a chosen focussed background are not known, we show they can be constructed once depletion is accounted for. We demonstrate this by giving the exact wavefunctions in a flying focus beam for which all energy is absorbed by particles scattering on it. In addition we use the wavefunctions to obtain a simple expression for the nonlinear Compton scattering amplitude, comparing with the plane wave case. Our methods thus open a new avenue of investigation in which two previously challenging effects are simultaneously brought under analytic control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects make the potential bias between the true and false vacua dependent on the temperature and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Dark Scalar Phase Transitions explanation of NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence of a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range is posed to open a new window on the Universe. A preferred explanation relies on a supercooled first order phase transition at the 100 MeV - GeV scale. In this article, we address the feasibility going from the particle physics model to the production of the gravitational waves. We take a minimal approach for the dark sector model introducing the fewest ingredients required, namely a new U(1) gauge group and a dark scalar that dynamically breaks the symmetry. Supercooling poses challenges in the analysis that put under question the feasibility of this explanation: we address them, going beyond previous studies by carefully considering the effects of a vacuum domination phase and explicitly tracking the phase transition from its onset to its completion. We find that the proposed model can successfully give origin to the observed PTA SGWB signal. The strong supercooling imposes a correlation between the new gauge coupling and the scalar quartic one, leading to a significant hierarchy between the (heavier) gauge boson and the dark scalar. Ultimately, information on phase transitions from SGWB observations could provide a direct probe of the microphysics of the Early Universe and be used to guide future searches of dark sector in laboratories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the potential impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurement within the SMOG2 fixed-target program at the LHCb experiment on nuclear parton distribution functions. Following~\cite{Bursche:2018orf}, we assume that SMOG2 will collect data for five nuclear targets: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and hydrogen which will provide a baseline for constructing nuclear ratios. The analysis is performed by using the PDF reweighting method. We demonstrate that such a measurement will allow to considerably reduce the current uncertainties of the nuclear gluon distribution and, to some extent, even the uncertainties of the light sea-quark distributions. Furthermore, it will provide the first possibility to systematically study the current assumptions on the $A$-dependence of the nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI/ML informed Symbolic Regression is the next stage of scientific modeling. We utilize a highly customizable symbolic regression package ``PySR" to model the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the flavor isovector combination $H_{u-d}(x,t,\xi)$ at $\xi=0$. These PySR models were trained on GPD results provided by both Lattice QCD and phenomenological sources GGL, GK, and VGG. We demonstrate, for the first time, the consistency and systematic convergence of Symbolic Regression by quantifying the disparate models through their Taylor expansion coefficients. In addition to PySR penalizing models with higher complexity and mean-squared error, we implement schemes that test specific physics hypotheses, including force-factorized $x$ and $t$ dependence and Regge behavior in PySR GPDs. We show that PySR can identify factorizing GPD sources based on their response to the Force-Factorized model. Knowing the precise behavior of the GPDs, and their uncertainties in a wide range in $x$ and $t$, crucially impacts our ability to concretely and quantitatively predict hadronic spatial distributions and their derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Stay Positive: Neural Refinement of Sample Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool in particle physics data analysis. Events are typically generated alongside weights that redistribute the cross section of the simulated process across the phase space. These weights can be negative, and several post-hoc methods have been developed to eliminate or mitigate the negative values. All of these methods share the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of phase space. We introduce an alternative approach, which, instead of reweighting to the average, refines the initial weights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent factor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight distribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase space is processed using neural networks for the refinement method. In addition to the refinement method, we introduce a new resampling protocol, which can be used in conjunction with any weight transformation to not only preserve the average weight but also the statistical uncertainties of the initial distribution. Using both realistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method is able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations and that the new resampling protocol is simpler in implementation than previous methods while exhibiting equivalent statistical properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the electromagnetic structure of the hidden-charm pentaquark $P_c(4337)$ is investigated within the diquark-diquark-antiquark model using the QCD light-cone sum rule approach. The magnetic moments of the $ P_c(4337) $ state are calculated for the spin-parity assignments $ J^P = \frac{1}{2}^- $ and $\frac{3}{2}^-$. The results are found to be $ \mu_{P_c} = 1.76 \pm 0.44~\mu_N $ for the $ \frac{1}{2}^- $ case and $ \mu_{P_c} = -1.38 \pm 0.35~\mu_N $ for the $ \frac{3}{2}^- $ scenario. These findings offer important insights into the internal quark-gluon structure and electromagnetic features of this multiquark system. Beyond their theoretical relevance, the results serve as essential benchmarks for future experimental studies aimed at determining the quantum numbers and underlying configuration of the $ P_c(4337) $. Additionally, the electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ state are extracted, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution for this exotic pentaquark.</description>

Abstract: The four-body decays $D^+ \to K^-\pi^+e^+\nu_e$ ($D_{e4}^+$) and $D^0\to \overline{K^0}\pi^-e^+\nu_e$ ($D^0_{e4}$) are studied in a model where the momentum-dependence of the hadronic matrix elements are described in terms of $K^*(892)$ and $D^*(2010)$ pole contributions. From fits to the recent data of the BESIII collaboration we find that the $D^*$-pole can mimic the effect of the $S$-wave contribution of the $K\pi$ system, which has been suggested as an observational evidence for the light scalar strange resonance. Implications for the determination of the $|V_{cs}|$ quark mixing matrix element are discussed.</description>

Abstract: This note is intended to serve as a reference for conventions used in the literature on string compactifications, and how to move between them, collected in a single and easy-to-find place, using type IIB as an illustrative example. We hope it may be useful to beginners in the field and busy experts. E.g. string constructions proposed to address the moduli stabilisation problem are generically in regions of parameter space at the boundaries of control, so that consistent use of $2\pi$'s and frame conventions can be pivotal when computing their potentially dangerous corrections.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Search for anti-quark nuggets via their interaction with the LHC beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures ("hairs") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>

Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter\textendash dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and, for the first time, numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions, improving upon earlier works that relied on approximations. We perform a comprehensive MCMC analysis using a combination of datasets including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results show a clear preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling, overcoming previous upper-bound-only constraints due to improved numerical accuracy and data precision. This preference is primarily driven by the late-time ISW effect. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$_0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields strong statistical support over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta{\rm AIC} = -0.75, -2.41$ respectively. If future data further supports a fifth force in the dark sector, non-linear structure formation could offer additional observational tests of such long-range interactions. This work also remains consistent with recent DESI observations of evolving dark energy, with the effective dark energy equation of state crossing the phantom divide around redshift $z \sim 0.5$, a feature that emerges naturally in our framework due to the scalar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>"Rosenbluth" separation of the $J/\psi $ near-threshold photoproduction -- an access to the gluon Gravitational Form Factors at high $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform analysis of the near-threshold $J/\psi $ photoproduction data off the proton based on two theoretical approaches, GPD [1] and holographic [2], that represent the differential cross sections as powers of the skewness parameter with coefficients that depend only on the momentum transfer $t$. This allows to separate kinematically the corresponding coefficient functions, in much the same way as this is done for the electric and magnetic form factors using the Rosenbluth separation. We examine the independence of the extracted functions with the photon beam energy. These functions, under additional assumptions, are related to the proton's gluon Gravitational Form Factors (gGFFs). We compare the extracted functions with lattice calculations of the gGFFs in the region of $0.5&lt;|t|&lt;2$~GeV$^{2}$, where they overlap. Such analysis demonstrates the possibility of extracting some combinations of the gGFFs from the data at high $t$, complementary to the lattice calculations available in the low $t$ region. However, higher statistics are needed to more accurately check the predicted scaling behavior of the data and compare with the lattice results, thus testing and comparing the theoretical assumptions used in the GPD and holographic models.</description>

      <title>Role of clustered nuclear geometry in particle production through p-C and p-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range multi-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions have shown conclusive evidence of the hydrodynamic behavior of strongly interacting matter and are associated with the final-state azimuthal momentum anisotropy. In small collision systems, azimuthal anisotropy can be influenced by the hadronization mechanism and residual jet-like correlations. Thus, one of the motives of the planned p--O and O--O collisions at the LHC and RHIC is to understand the origin of small system collectivity. As the anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) are sensitive to the initial-state effects including nuclear shape, deformation, and charge density profiles, studies involving $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei are transpiring due to the presence of exotic $\alpha$ ($^{4}$He) clusters in such nuclei. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the effects of nuclear $\alpha$--clusters on the azimuthal anisotropy of the final-state hadrons in p--C and p--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 9.9$~TeV within a multi-phase transport model framework. We report the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) spectra, participant eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and triangularity ($\epsilon_3$), and estimate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) of the final-state hadrons using the two-particle cumulant method. These results are compared with a model-independent Sum of Gaussians (SOG) type nuclear density profile for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei.</description>

      <title>St\"uckelberg path to pure de Sitter supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the study of pure de Sitter supergravity by introducing a finite formulation of unimodular supergravity via the super-St\"uckelberg mechanism. Building on previous works, we construct a complete four-dimensional action of spontaneously broken ${\cal N}\!\!=\!\!1$ supergravity to all orders, which allows for de Sitter solutions. The introduction of finite supergravity transformations extends the super-St\"uckelberg procedure beyond the second order, offering a recursive solution to all orders in the goldstino sector. This work bridges the earlier perturbative approaches and the complete finite theory, opening new possibilities for de Sitter vacua in supergravity models and eventually string theory.</description>

      <title>Classical (and Quantum) Heuristics for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound on the sensitivity of generic mechanical and electromagnetic gravitational wave detectors. We consider both classical and quantum detection schemes, although we focus on the former. Our results allow for a simple reproduction of the sensitivities of a variety of experiments, including optical interferometers, resonant bars, optomechanical sensors, and electromagnetic conversion experiments. In the high-frequency regime, all detection schemes we consider can be characterised by their stored electromagnetic energy and the signal transfer function, which we provide. We discuss why high-frequency gravitational wave searches are especially difficult and primordial gravitational wave backgrounds might not be detectable above the sensitivity window of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Second order fluctuations of conserved charges in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice QCD investigation of second-order fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges -- baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), and strangeness (S) -- in the presence of external magnetic fields. Our study employs lattice simulations of (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical pion masses using highly improved staggered fermions (HISQ) on $48^3 \times 12$ and $32^3 \times 8$ lattices, covering a wide range of magnetic field strengths up to $eB \simeq 0.8$ GeV$ ^2$. We identify clear signals of magnetic field-induced modifications to these fluctuations and correlations, with the baryon-electric charge correlation, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, exhibiting particularly strong sensitivity to the magnetic field. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and construct proxy observables for fluctuations measurable in heavy-ion collision experiments. Our findings highlight $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ as a promising ``magnetometer" for probing the presence of magnetic fields in QCD matter. Furthermore, we explore experimentally relevant ratios involving $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, demonstrating their potential in mitigating volume effects and enhancing sensitivity to magnetic fields in collision environments. Additionally, we assess the limitations of the HRG model at strong magnetic fields, revealing deviations that indicate nontrivial modifications to hadronic degrees of freedom. These results offer new insights into the interplay between thermal and magnetic effects in the QCD phase diagram and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>
