      <title>Growth and characterization of single crystal cubic TaN and hexagonal Ta$_2$N films on c-plane Sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two single crystal phases of tantalum nitride were stabilized on c-plane sapphire using molecular beam epitaxy. The phases were identified to be $\delta$-TaN with a rocksalt cubic structure and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N with a hexagonal structure. Atomic force microscopy scans revealed smooth surfaces for both the films with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.3 nm. Phase-purity of these films was determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman spectrum of the phase-pure $\delta$-TaN and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N obtained will serve as a future reference to determine phase-purity of tantalum nitride films. Further, the room-temperature and low-temperature electronic transport measurements indicated that both of these phases are metallic at room temperature with resistivities of 586.2 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 75.5 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film and become superconducting below 3.6 K and 0.48 K respectively. The superconducting transition temperature reduces with applied magnetic field as expected. Ginzburg-Landau fitting revealed a 0 K critical magnetic field and coherence length of 18 T and 4.2 nm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 96 mT and 59 nm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film. These tantalum nitride films are of high interest for superconducting resonators and qubits.</description>

      <title>From pure to mixed: Altermagnets as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using altermagnetic phases as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators. The transmutation of pure into mixed altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and the concomitant development of an anomalous Hall response can be associated with the breaking of specific lattice symmetries by external fields or the development of subleading order parameters. We introduce the basic ideas in the context of RuO$_2$ and discuss the case of surface magnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our study suggests that if Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ hosts a pure altermagnet on its surface, the onset of specific superconducting states could transmute this altermagnet from pure to mixed and account for the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at the superconducting transition temperature, without necessarily ascribing TRSB to the superconducting state. Further investigation of this unusual scenario could provide essential steps toward a more coherent picture of the phenomenology of this material.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Refractory Transition-Metal Nitride Films for Advanced Electronics and Plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of semiconductor materials has played a crucial role in the development of electronic and optical devices. However, scaling down semiconductor devices to the nanoscale has imposed limitations on device properties due to quantum effects. Hence, the search for successor materials has become a central focus in the fields of materials science and physics. Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are extraordinary materials known for their outstanding stability, biocompatibility, and ability to integrate with semiconductors. Over the past few decades, TMNs have been extensively employed in various fields. However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMNs has long been challenging, hindering the advancement of their high-performance electronics and plasmonics. Fortunately, progress in film deposition techniques has enabled the successful epitaxial growth of high-quality TMN films. In comparison to reported reviews, there is a scarcity of reviews on epitaxial TMN films from the perspective of materials physics and condensed matter physics, particularly at the atomic level. Therefore, this review aims to provide a brief summary of recent progress in epitaxial growth at atomic precision, emergent physical properties (superconductivity, magnetism, ferroelectricity, and plasmon), and advanced electronic and plasmonic devices associated with epitaxial TMN films.</description>

      <title>Majorana sweet spots in 3-site Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains, composed of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor, have emerged as an attractive platform to realize Majorana bound states (MBSs). These excitations exist when the ground state is degenerate. The additional requirement of isolating the MBS wavefunctions further restricts the parameter space to discrete sweet spots. While scaling up to Kitaev chains with more than two sites has the potential to improve the stability of the MBSs, longer chains offer more features to optimize, including the MBS localization length and the excitation gap. In this work, we theoretically investigate 3-site Kitaev chains and show that there are three different types of sweet spots, obtained by maximizing distinct MBS properties: genuine 3-site sweet spots with well-localized MBSs at the ends, effective 2-site sweet spots, where the middle site acts as a barrier, and sweet spots with delocalized MBSs that overlap in the middle of the chain. These three cases feature different degrees of robustness against perturbations, with the genuine 3-site being the most stable. We analyze the energy spectrum, transport, and microwave absorption associated with these three cases, showing how to distinguish them.</description>

      <title>Spin and pair density waves in 2D altermagnetic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently proposed and experimentally confirmed class of magnetic order, features collinear compensated magnetism with unconventional d-, g-, or i-wave spin order. Here, we show that in a metallic 2D d-wave altermagnet with combined two-fold spin and four-fold lattice rotational symmetry $[C_2||C_4]$, secondary instabilities can arise. Using an unbiased functional renormalization group approach, we analyze the weak-coupling instabilities of a 2D Hubbard model with a preexisting altermagnetic order inspired by our ab initio electronic structure calculations of realistic material candidates from V$_2$X$_2$O (X = Te, Se) family. We identify two distinct spin density wave (SDW) states that break the underlying altermagnetic $[C_2||C_4]$ symmetry. Additionally, we find spin-fluctuation-induced instabilities leading to a singlet d-wave superconducting state and an unconventional commensurate pair density wave (PDW) state with extended s-wave and spin-triplet symmetry. We establish a general criterion for the unusual exchange statistics for these pair density waves and characterize their excitation spectrum, which exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces or nodal points depending on the gap size.</description>

      <title>Tunable Josephson diode effect in singlet superconductor-altermagnet-triplet superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered phase of collinear magnet called, altermagnet breaks time reversal symmetry (TRS), exhibits momentum-dependent spin-splitting of band structure with zero net magnetization. In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconductors with the interlayer pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompted by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, this study delves into a theoretical investigation of spin excitations within this intriguing material. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we propose that superconductivity in this compound is primarily driven by interlayer pairing mechanisms. This interlayer pairing results in an effective $s_\pm$ pairing gap, with the sign of the pairing gap varying across different Fermi pockets. In the superconducting state, our analysis reveals a striking absence of a spin resonance mode. Moreover, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetization texture imprints produced by flux avalanches in ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic textures generated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field at the ferromagnetic layer of $Co/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb$ thin film heterostructures are investigated using magneto-optical imaging and micromagnetic simulations. It is observed that the stray field caused by flux avalanches in the superconducting layer prints out a non-trivial in-plane texture in the cobalt layer, which remains stable up to temperatures much above the Nb critical temperature. These textures mimic quite closely the dendritic thermomagnetic flux avalanches that penetrate the Nb layer from its edges. For low cobalt thickness, the filamentary magnetic textures occur in pairs with opposite polarity. The previous in-plane magnetization determines the relative location of the magnetic filaments with respect to the avalanche position. Micromagnetic simulations solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation confirm the interpretation given for the experimental findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of many superconducting devices. Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. In contrast to previous models of superconducting devices, our ab initio approach is capable of making predictions of device performance without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications. Although we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal symmetry, have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying a small magnetic field as well as a tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% with the introduction of 1% impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The resulting giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originates from the nonlocal contribution of the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation of why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to dilute impurities.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.</description>
