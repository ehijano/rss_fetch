      <title>What's So Hard about the Monty Hall Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monty Hall problem is notorious for its deceptive simplicity. Although today it is widely used as a provocative thought experiment to introduce Bayesian thinking to students of probability, in the not so distant past it was rejected by established mathematicians. This essay provides some historical background to the problem and explains why it is considered so counter-intuitive to many. It is argued that the main barrier to understanding the problem is the back-grounding of the concept of dependence in probability theory as it is commonly taught. To demonstrate this, a Bayesian solution is provided and augmented with a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) inspired by the work of Pearl (1988, 1998). Although the Bayesian approach produces the correct answer, without a representation of the dependency structure of events implied by the problem, the salient fact that motivates the problem's solution remains hidden.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Rare Population Detection and Sampling: A Methodological Approach in Liguria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic policy sciences are constantly investigating the quality of well-being of broad sections of the population in order to describe the current interdependence between unequal living conditions, low levels of education and a lack of integration into society. Such studies are often carried out in the form of surveys, e.g. as part of the EU-SILC program. If the survey is designed at national or international level, the results of the study are often used as a reference by a broad range of public institutions. However, the sampling strategy per se may not capture enough information to provide an accurate representation of all population strata. Problems might arise from rare, or hard-to-sample, populations and the conclusion of the study may be compromised or unrealistic. We propose here a two-phase methodology to identify rare, poorly sampled populations and then resample the hard-to-sample strata. We focused our attention on the 2019 EU-SILC section concerning the Italian region of Liguria. Methods based on dispersion indices or deep learning were used to detect rare populations. A multi-frame survey was proposed as the sampling design. The results showed that factors such as citizenship, material deprivation and large families are still fundamental characteristics that are difficult to capture.</description>
