      <title>Computing Longitudinal Dynamic Derivatives of a VTOL Aircraft Using CFD Simulations and Forced-Oscillation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of dynamic aerodynamic derivatives during aircraft transition phases using advanced CFD simulations and forced oscillation testing. Two case studies are examined: a three dimensional fighter aircraft (Standard Dynamic Model, SDM) and a UT24 eVTOL model. The transition phase from vertical hover to forward cruise is analyzed with harmonic oscillation techniques to capture unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments. Grid sensitivity studies and multi zone meshing strategies ensure simulation accuracy, while ANSYS Fluent finite volume solver and coupled pressure velocity algorithms provide high fidelity results. Dynamic derivatives are derived from variations in angle of attack, flight path, and rotational movements, with experimental and numerical data validating the approach. The findings offer valuable insights for robust control design and stability analysis, supporting future advancements in urban air mobility and aerospace engineering. Overall, this approach demonstrates substantial promise for optimizing aircraft performance during critical transition phases. These results pave the way for future innovations</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning in pursuit-evasion differential game: safety, stability and robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety and stability are two critical concerns in pursuit-evasion (PE) problems in an obstacle-rich environment. Most existing works combine control barrier functions (CBFs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to provide an efficient and safe solution. However, they do not consider the presence of disturbances, such as wind gust and actuator fault, which may exist in many practical applications. This paper integrates CBFs and a sliding mode control (SMC) term into RL to simultaneously address safety, stability, and robustness to disturbances. However, this integration is significantly challenging due to the strong coupling between the CBF and SMC terms. Inspired by Stackelberg game, we handle the coupling issue by proposing a hierarchical design scheme where SMC and safe control terms interact with each other in a leader-follower manner. Specifically, the CBF controller, acting as the leader, enforces safety independently of the SMC design; while the SMC term, as the follower, is designed based on the CBF controller. We then formulate the PE problem as a zero-sum game and propose a safe robust RL framework to learn the min-max strategy online. A sufficient condition is provided under which the proposed algorithm remains effective even when constraints are conflicting. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safe robust RL framework.</description>

      <title>A safety governor for learning explicit MPC controllers from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle neural networks (NNs) to approximate model predictive control (MPC) laws. We propose a novel learning-based explicit MPC structure, which is reformulated into a dual-mode scheme over maximal constrained feasible set. The scheme ensuring the learning-based explicit MPC reduces to linear feedback control while entering the neighborhood of origin. We construct a safety governor to ensure that learning-based explicit MPC satisfies all the state and input constraints. Compare to the existing approach, our approach is computationally easier to implement even in high-dimensional system. The proof of recursive feasibility for the safety governor is given. Our approach is demonstrated on numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Whale Optimization Algorithms based fractional order fuzzy PID controller for Depth of Anesthesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important surgical factors is Depth of Anesthesia (DOA) control in patients. The main problem is to overcome the uncertainty and nonlinearity of the system, due to different physiological parameters of the patient's body and maintain DOA of patients in desired range during surgery. This study demonstrates a fractional order fuzzy PID controller (FOFPID) and fractional order PID controller (FOPID) to the problem. The Whale Optimization Algorithms (WOA) is used to optimized the parameters of proposed controllers. The orders of derivative and integral fractional controller is achieved by WOA. The results indicate that FOFPID has a better performance than FOPID. To check the performance of the controllers in presence of uncertainty, physiological logical model of 8 patients has been investigated. The modeling is based on Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic model. The results show the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Comparing Behavioural Cloning and Reinforcement Learning for Spacecraft Guidance and Control Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance &amp; control networks (G&amp;CNETs) provide a promising alternative to on-board guidance and control (G&amp;C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control architecture. When training G&amp;CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge: behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors. Although both approaches have been adopted in G&amp;CNET related literature, direct comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&amp;CNETs on continuous-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training framework tailored to G&amp;CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&amp;CNETs excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast RL-trained G&amp;CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the generation of training samples.</description>

      <title>Biogeography-Based Optimization of Fuzzy Controllers for Improved Quarter Car Suspension Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes optimized Type-I and Type-II fuzzy controllers for automotive suspension systems to enhance ride comfort and stability under road disturbances (step/sine inputs), addressing the lack of systematic performance comparisons in existing literature. We integrate Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to tune controller parameters for a quarter car model, with emphasis on BBO's underexplored efficacy. MATLAB Simulink simulations demonstrate that BBO-optimized Type-II fuzzy control reduces body displacement by 22% and acceleration by 18% versus baseline methods under step disturbances, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework provides practical, high-performance solutions for modern vehicles, particularly electric and autonomous platforms where vibration attenuation and energy efficiency are critical.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Emergency Evacuation in Large Scale Metropolitan Railway Systems for Urban Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simulation for traffic evacuation during railway disruptions to enhance urban resilience. The research focuses on large-scale railway networks and provides flexible simulation settings to accommodate multiple node or line failures. The evacuation optimization model is mathematically formulated using matrix computation and nonlinear programming. The simulation integrates railway lines operated by various companies, along with external geographical features of the network. Furthermore, to address computational complexity in large-scale graph networks, a subgraph partitioning solution is employed for computation acceleration. The model is evaluated using the extensive railway network of Greater Tokyo. Data collection included both railway network structure and real-world GPS footfall data to estimate the number of station-area visitors for simulation input and evaluation purposes. Several evacuation scenarios were simulated for major stations including Tokyo, Shinjuku, Shibuya and so on. The results demonstrate that both evacuation passenger flow (EPF) and average travel time (ATT) during emergencies were successfully optimized, while remaining within the capacity constraints of neighboring stations and the targeted disruption recovery times.</description>

      <title>Controller Design of an Airship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airships offer unique operational advantages due to their ability to generate lift via buoyancy, enabling low-speed flight and stationary hovering. These capabilities make them ideal for missions requiring endurance and precision positioning. However, they also present significant control challenges: their large, lightweight structures are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces lose effectiveness during low-speed or hover flight. The objective of this thesis is to develop a robust control strategy tailored to a vectored-thrust airship equipped with tiltable propellers. The proposed approach is based on an Extended Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion inner loop in combination with a high level outer loop, controlling the attitude and velocity of the airship. The proposed method is able to effectively control the airship over the whole envelope, including hover and high speed flight. For this, effective use of available actuators is key. This includes especially the tilt rotors, for which a control allocation method is presented. The controller's performance is validated through a series of simulation-based test scenarios, including aggressive maneuvering, gust rejection, atmospheric turbulence, and significant parameter mismatches. The controller is compared against an alternative controller developed at the institute, offering insight into the trade-offs between direct inversion and incremental control approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed E-INDI controller achieves very good tracking performance and high high robustness against parameter uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Diversity and Interaction Quality of a Heterogeneous Multi-Agent System Applied to a Synchronization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, scalable controller design to achieve output synchronization for a heterogeneous discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent system is considered. The agents are assumed to exhibit potentially nonlinear dynamics but share linear common oscillatory modes. In a distributed control architecture, scalability is ensured by designing a small number of distinguished controllers, significantly fewer than the number of agents, even when agent diversity is high. Our findings indicate that the number of controllers required can be effectively determined by the number of strongly connected components of the underlying graph. The study in this paper builds on the recently developed phase theory of matrices and systems. First, we employ the concept of matrix phase, specifically the phase alignability of a collection of matrices, to quantify agent diversity. Next, we use matrix phase, particularly the essential phase of the graph Laplacian, to evaluate the interaction quality among the agents. Based on these insights, we derive a sufficient condition for the solvability of the synchronization problem, framed as a trade-off between the agent diversity and the interaction quality. In the process, a controller design procedure based on Lyapunov analysis is provided, which produces low gain, component-wise synchronizing controllers when the solvability condition is satisfied. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. Furthermore, we consider cases where the component-wise controller design problem is unsolvable. We propose alternative strategies involving the design of a small inventory of controllers, which can still achieve synchronization effectively by employing certain clustering methods to manage heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Wardropian Cycles make traffic assignment both optimal and fair by eliminating price-of-anarchy with Cyclical User Equilibrium for compliant connected autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations.
  We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</description>

      <title>CDA-SimBoost: A Unified Framework Bridging Real Data and Simulation for Infrastructure-Based CDA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) has garnered increasing research attention, yet the role of intelligent infrastructure remains insufficiently explored. Existing solutions offer limited support for addressing long-tail challenges, real-synthetic data fusion, and heterogeneous sensor management. This paper introduces CDA-SimBoost, a unified framework that constructs infrastructure-centric simulation environments from real-world data. CDA-SimBoost consists of three main components: a Digital Twin Builder for generating high-fidelity simulator assets based on sensor and HD map data, OFDataPip for processing both online and offline data streams, and OpenCDA-InfraX, a high-fidelity platform for infrastructure-focused simulation. The system supports realistic scenario construction, rare event synthesis, and scalable evaluation for CDA research. With its modular architecture and standardized benchmarking capabilities, CDA-SimBoost bridges real-world dynamics and virtual environments, facilitating reproducible and extensible infrastructure-driven CDA studies.

      <title>Star Tracker Misalignment Compensation in Deep Space Navigation Through Model-Based Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel adaptive framework for simultaneously estimating spacecraft attitude and sensor misalignment. Uncorrected star tracker misalignment can introduce significant pointing errors that compromise mission objectives in GPS-denied environments. To address this challenge, the proposed architecture integrates a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) framework operating over an N x N x N 3D hypothesis grid. Each hypothesis employs a 9-state Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) to estimate attitude, angular velocity, and gyroscope bias using TRIAD-based vector measurements. A key contribution is the development of a robust grid refinement strategy that uses hypothesis diversity and weighted-mean grid centering to prevent the premature convergence commonly encountered in classical, dominant model-based refinement triggers. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the final misalignment RMSE relative to classical approaches, achieving arcsecond-level accuracy. The resulting framework offers a computationally tractable and statistically robust solution for in-flight calibration, enhancing the navigational autonomy of resource-constrained spacecraft.</description>

      <title>The Phantom of Davis-Wielandt Shell: A Unified Framework for Graphical Stability Analysis of MIMO LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell for graphical stability analysis of multi-input and multi-output linear time-invariant feedback systems. Connections between DW shells and various graphical descriptions, as well as gain and phase measures, are established through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we examine the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation conditions. A rotated Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) concept is proposed as a mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a reliable algorithm for visualizing the rotated SRGs and include an example to demonstrate the non-conservatism of the proposed condition.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbit tracking in cislunar space: A finite-horizon approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for maintaining a spacecraft within a specified family of periodic orbits near the libration points in cislunar space. Unlike traditional approaches that track a predefined reference orbit, the proposed method designs an optimal trajectory that keeps the spacecraft within the orbit family, regardless of the initial reference. The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is used to model the system dynamics. First, the Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (PAC) method is employed to compute the members of each orbit family. Then, the state of each member is parameterized by two variables: one defining the orbit and the other specifying the location along it. These computed states are then fit to a Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) model. An NMPC framework is developed to generate the optimal reference trajectory and compute the corresponding velocity impulses for trajectory tracking. The control system is integrated with a Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) observer that estimates the spacecraft's relative state. Numerical simulations are conducted for Lyapunov, halo, and near-rectilinear halo orbits near L1 and L2. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in fuel consumption compared to conventional tracking methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design for finite-time position control of quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A robust, finite-time, nonlinear feedback controller is introduced to reject bounded disturbances in tracking tasks. The proposed control framework differs conceptually from conventional controllers that utilize Euler angle parameterization for attitude and adhere to the traditional hierarchical inner-outer loop design. In standard approaches, the translational controller and the corresponding desired attitude are computed first, followed by the design of the attitude controller based on time-scale separation between fast attitude and slow translational dynamics. In contrast, the proposed control scheme is quaternion-based and utilizes a transit feed-forward term in the attitude dynamics that anticipates the slower translational subsystem. Robustness is achieved through the use of continuously differentiable sliding manifolds. The proposed approach guarantees semi-global finite-time stability, without requiring time-scale separation. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>On Certificates for Almost Sure Reachability in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost sure reachability refers to the property of a stochastic system whereby, from any initial condition, the system state reaches a given target set with probability one. In this paper, we study the problem of certifying almost sure reachability in discrete-time stochastic systems using drift and variant conditions. While these conditions are both necessary and sufficient in theory, computational approaches often rely on restricting the search to fixed templates, such as polynomial or quadratic functions. We show that this restriction compromises completeness: there exists a polynomial system for which a given target set is almost surely reachable but admits no polynomial certificate, and a linear system for which a neighborhood of the origin is almost surely reachable but admits no quadratic certificate. We then provide a complete characterization of reachability certificates for linear systems with additive noise. Our analysis yields conditions on the system matrices under which valid certificates exist, and shows how the structure and dimension of the system determine the need for non-quadratic templates. Our results generalize the classical random walk behavior to a broader class of stochastic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A Truthful Mechanism Design for Distributed Optimisation Algorithms in Networks with Self-interested Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing resilience in multi-agent systems in the face of selfish agents is an important problem that requires further characterisation. This work develops a truthful mechanism that avoids self-interested and strategic agents maliciously manipulating the algorithm. We prove theoretically that the proposed mechanism incentivises self-interested agents to participate and follow the provided algorithm faithfully. Additionally, the mechanism is compatible with any distributed optimisation algorithm that can calculate at least one subgradient at a given point. Finally, we present an illustrative example that shows the effectiveness of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Probabilistic Latent Variable Models' Specification via Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue of model specification in probabilistic latent variable models (PLVMs) using an infinite-horizon optimal control approach. Traditional PLVMs rely on joint distributions to model complex data, but introducing latent variables results in an ill-posed parameter learning problem. To address this issue, regularization terms are typically introduced, leading to the development of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, where the latent variable distribution is restricted to a predefined normalized distribution family to facilitate the expectation step. To overcome this limitation, we propose representing the latent variable distribution as a finite set of instances perturbed via an ordinary differential equation with a control policy. This approach ensures that the instances asymptotically converge to the true latent variable distribution as time approaches infinity. By doing so, we reformulate the distribution inference problem as an optimal control policy determination problem, relaxing the model specification to an infinite-horizon path space. Building on this formulation, we derive the corresponding optimal control policy using the Pontryagin's maximum principle and provide a closed-form expression for its implementation using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that, we develop a novel, convergence-guaranteed EM algorithm for PLVMs based on this infinite-horizon-optimal-control-based inference strategy. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>ACCESS-AV: Adaptive Communication-Computation Codesign for Sustainable Autonomous Vehicle Localization in Smart Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast 5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30 cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for sustainable smart factory environments.</description>

      <title>HJB-based online safety-embedded critic learning for uncertain systems with self-triggered mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based optimal control framework for safety-critical systems with parametric uncertainties, addressing both time-triggered and self-triggered controller implementations. First, we develop a robust control barrier function (RCBF) incorporating Lyapunov-based compensation terms to rigorously guarantee safety despite parametric uncertainties. Building on this safety guarantee, we formulate the constrained optimal control problem as the minimization of a novel safety-embedded value function, where the RCBF is involved via a Lagrange multiplier that adaptively balances safety constraints against optimal stabilization objectives. To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a self-triggered implementation mechanism that reduces control updates while maintaining dual stability-safety guarantees. The resulting self-triggered constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is solved through an online safety-embedded critic learning framework, with the Lagrange multiplier computed in real time to ensure safety. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving both safety and control performance.</description>

      <title>A Modified Adaptive Data-Enabled Policy Optimization Control to Resolve State Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes modifications to the data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) algorithm to mitigate state perturbations. DeePO is an adaptive, data-driven approach designed to iteratively compute a feedback gain equivalent to the certainty-equivalence LQR gain. Like other data-driven approaches based on Willems' fundamental lemma, DeePO requires persistently exciting input signals. However, linear state-feedback gains from LQR designs cannot inherently produce such inputs. To address this, probing noise is conventionally added to the control signal to ensure persistent excitation. However, the added noise may induce undesirable state perturbations. We first identify two key issues that jeopardize the desired performance of DeePO when probing noise is not added: the convergence of states to the equilibrium point, and the convergence of the controller to its optimal value. To address these challenges without relying on probing noise, we propose Perturbation-Free DeePO (PFDeePO) built on two fundamental principles. First, the algorithm pauses the control gain updating in DeePO process when system states are near the equilibrium point. Second, it applies a multiplicative noise, scaled by a mean value of $1$ as a gain for the control signal, when the controller converges. This approach minimizes the impact of noise as the system approaches equilibrium while preserving stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFDeePO through simulations, showcasing its ability to eliminate state perturbations while maintaining system performance and stability.</description>

      <title>Sequential Operation of Residential Energy Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of residential energy hubs with multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to different carrier dynamics, hybrid storage coordination and high-dimensional action-spaces. Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the set points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage economic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including physics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The hierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In particular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and continuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage systems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day auctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no intra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to follow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the winter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation. Finally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the thermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by static battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.</description>

      <title>Convergent Weight and Activation Dynamics in Memristor Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of dynamic feedback neural networks (NNs), as the Cohen-Grossberg, Hopfield and cellular NNs, has been for a long time a workhorse of NN theory. Indeed, convergence in the presence of multiple stable equilibrium points (EPs) is crucial to implement content addressable memories and solve several other signal processing tasks in real time. There are two typical ways to use a convergent NN, i.e.: a) let the activations evolve while maintaining fixed weights and inputs (activation dynamics) or b) adapt the weights while maintaining fixed activations (weight dynamics). As remarked in a seminal paper by Hirsch, there is another interesting possibility, i.e., let the neuron interconnection weights evolve while simultaneously running the activation dynamics (weight-activation dynamics). The weight-activation dynamics is of importance also because it is more plausible than the other two types for modeling neural systems. The paper breaks new ground by analyzing for the first time in a systematic way the convergence properties of the weight-activation dynamics for a class of memristor feedback dynamic NNs. The main result is that, under suitable assumptions on the structure of the memristor interconnections, the solutions (weights and activations) converge to an EP, except at most for a set of initial conditions with zero measure. The result includes the most important case where the NN has multiple stable EPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the effects of the thermal noise of the base resistance of common emitter amplifier (CEA) on the output SNR, and we show that a first order Butterworth filter at the output of the CEA significantly improves output SNR significantly and supress the performances of higher order Butterworth, Chebyshev I, II and elliptic filters. We propose a formula for the selection of cut-off frequency of analog filters for given orders to achieve significant SNR improvement at CEA output. Considering the filter complexity and output SNR improvement, we can conclude that the first order Butterworth filter outperforms Chebyshev I, II and elliptic filters.</description>

      <title>What's Really Different with AI? -- A Behavior-based Perspective on System Safety for Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuring safety for ``AI-based'' systems is one of the current challenges in safety engineering. For automated driving systems, in particular, further assurance challenges result from the open context that the systems need to operate in after deployment. The current standardization and regulation landscape for ``AI-based'' systems is becoming ever more complex, as standards and regulations are being released at high frequencies.
  This position paper seeks to provide guidance for making qualified arguments which standards should meaningfully be applied to (``AI-based'') automated driving systems. Furthermore, we argue for clearly differentiating sources of risk between AI-specific and general uncertainties related to the open context. In our view, a clear conceptual separation can help to exploit commonalities that can close the gap between system-level and AI-specific safety analyses, while ensuring the required rigor for engineering safe ``AI-based'' systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin Reduced Order Models for fluid flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper investigates the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) method for reduced order models (ROM) and fluid dynamics governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</description>

      <title>Beyond Line-of-Sight: Cooperative Localization Using Vision and V2X Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations). Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment, (ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>UAV-Borne Digital Radar System for Coherent Multistatic SAR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology have enabled higher sampling rates, making it feasible to adopt digital radar architectures that directly sample the radio-frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for analog downconversion. This digital approach supports greater flexibility in waveform design and signal processing, particularly through digital modulation schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper presents a digital radar system mounted on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), which employs OFDM waveforms for coherent multistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging in the L-band. The radar setup features a primary UAV node responsible for signal transmission and monostatic data acquisition, alongside secondary nodes that operate in a receive-only mode. These secondary nodes capture the radar signal reflected from the scene as well as a direct sidelink signal. RF signals from both the radar and sidelink paths are sampled and processed offline. To manage data storage efficiently, a trigger mechanism is employed to record only the relevant portions of the radar signal. The system maintains coherency in both fast-time and slow-time domains, which is essential for multistatic SAR imaging. Because the secondary nodes are passive, the system can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger swarm of UAVs. The paper details the full signal processing workflow for both monostatic and multistatic SAR image formation, including an analysis and correction of synchronization errors that arise from the uncoupled operation of the nodes. The proposed coherent processing method is validated through static radar measurements, demonstrating coherency achieved by the concept. Additionally, a UAV-based bistatic SAR experiment demonstrates the system's performance by producing high-resolution monostatic, bistatic, and combined multistatic SAR images.</description>

      <title>Minimum Attention Control (MAC) in a Receding Horizon Framework with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum Attention Control (MAC) is a control technique that provides minimal input changes to meet the control objective. Mathematically, the zero norm of the input changes is used as a constraint for the given control objective and minimized with respect to the process dynamics. In this paper, along with the zero norm constraint, stage costs are also considered for reference tracking in a receding horizon framework. For this purpose, the optimal inputs of the previous horizons are also considered in the optimization problem of the current horizon. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem (Minimum Attention Model Predictive Control (MAMPC)). The outer step of the optimization is a quadratic program, while the inner step, which solves for sparsity, has an analytical solution. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two case studies: a four-tank system with slow dynamics and a fuel cell stack with fast dynamics. A detailed comparative study of the proposed algorithm with standard MPC indicates sparse control actions with a tradeoff in the tracking error.</description>

      <title>dq Modeling for Series-Parallel Compensated Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Series-parallel (SP) compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems are widely used in some specific scenarios, such as bioelectronics and portable electronics. However, most studies are based on the phasor method and focused on the steady-state analysis, which may overlook the transient process of systems. Accordingly, inspired by the notion of coordinate transformation in the field of motor drive, this work develops a dq modeling method for SP compensated WPT systems. The proposed model effectively characterizes first-order system dynamics, facilitating enhanced measurement precision and control system development. One measurement application, dq model-based mutual inductance identification, is presented to reflect the value of the dq model. Simulation results are shown to validate the model's effectiveness, indicating that the developed model can be a good tool for the design of SP compensated WPT systems.</description>

      <title>A lightweight numerical model for predictive control of borehole thermal energy storages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) can reduce the operation of fossil fuel-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for buildings. With BTES, thermal energy is stored via a borehole heat exchanger in the ground. Model predictive control (MPC) may maximize the use of BTES by achieving a dynamic interaction between the building and BTES. However, modeling BTES for MPC is challenging, and a trade-off between model accuracy and an easy-to-solve optimal control problem (OCP) must be found. This manuscript presents an accurate numerical model yielding an easy-to-solve linear-quadratic OCP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a novel guidance and control strategy for cislunar near-rectilinear halo orbit formation-keeping applied to high-fidelity dynamics. Bounded relative motion is constructed about long-duration ephemeris trajectories with osculating invariant circles to form quasi-periodic relative orbits. State-of-the-art absolute control strategies are paired with a simple and effective relative control feedback law. Finally, a control barrier function is implemented to ensure recursively passively-safe bounded relative motion under feedback in the presence of possible missed maneuver events for the duration of the formation flight. The strategy is verified in high-fidelity simulation environments through Monte Carlo trials.</description>

      <title>Reward-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control in Precision Autonomous Parking via Policy Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints, frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins. However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward (MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a 91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior, while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability, accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall, RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility, the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.</description>

      <title>RAKOMO: Reachability-Aware K-Order Markov Path Optimization for Quadrupedal Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However, trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.</description>

      <title>DOA: A Degeneracy Optimization Agent with Adaptive Pose Compensation Capability based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent (DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2) inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments. Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization. Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.</description>

      <title>Feeling the Force: A Nuanced Physics-based Traversability Sensor for Navigation in Unstructured Vegetation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation. Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a foundation for developing future learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>VAE-GAN Based Price Manipulation in Coordinated Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market (LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness improves through emergent cooperation among agents.</description>

      <title>Homotopy-aware Multi-agent Navigation via Distributed Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency, yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated dense scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-user Immersive Reality (MIR) landscape is evolving rapidly, with applications spanning virtual collaboration, entertainment, and training. However, wireless network limitations create a critical bottleneck, struggling to meet the high-bandwidth and ultra-low latency demands essential for next-generation MIR experiences. This paper presents Hera, a modular framework for next-generation immersive applications, comprising a high-level streaming and synchronization layer for AR/VR systems and a low-level delay-based QoE-aware rate control protocol optimized for dynamic wireless environments. The Hera framework integrates application-aware streaming logic with a QoE-centric rate control core, enabling adaptive video quality, multi-user fairness, and low-latency communication across challenging 5G network conditions. We demonstrate that Hera outperforms existing state-of-the-art rate control algorithms by maintaining up to 66% lower latencies with comparable throughput performance, higher visual quality with 50% average bitrate improvements in our analysis, and improved fairness. By bridging the gap between application-level responsiveness and network-level adaptability, Hera lays the foundation for more scalable, robust, and high-fidelity multi-user immersive experiences.</description>

      <title>LLMs-guided adaptive compensator: Bringing Adaptivity to Automatic Control Systems with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control, this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead, the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity. Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability, adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and practicality compared to vision-language models.</description>

Abstract: We develop the symplectic elimnation algorithm. This algorithm using simple row operations reduce a symplectic matrix to a diagonal matrix. This algorithm gives rise to a decomposition of an arbitrary matrix into a product of a symplectic matrix and a reduced matrix. This decomposition is similar to the SR decomposition studied for a long time, which is analogous to the QR decomposition.</description>

However, their practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges: degradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the computational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This paper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated extreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation framework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network contains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this field to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance corresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending up to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the proposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used here to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows for time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and boosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental conditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a framework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep learning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and edge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and real-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical deployment requirements. Furthermore, this work reveals a new direction for building more efficient, robust and explainable artificial intelligence systems for DOFS technologies.</description>

      <title>Fundamental diagram constrained dynamic optimal transport via proximal splitting methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport has recently been brought forward as a tool for modeling and efficiently solving a variety of flow problems, such as origin-destination problems and multi-commodity flow problems. Although the framework has shown to be effective for many large scale flow problems, the formulations typically lack dynamic properties used in common traffic models, such as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. In this work, we propose an optimal transport framework that includes dynamic constraints specified by the fundamental diagram for modeling macroscopic traffic flow. The problem is cast as a convex variant of dynamic optimal transport, with additional nonlinear temporal-spatial inequality constraints of momentum, modeled after the fundamental diagram from traffic theory. This constraint imposes a density-dependent upper bound on the admissible flux, capturing flow saturation and congestion effects, and thus leaves space for kinetic optimization. The formulation follows the Benamou-Brenier transportation rationale, whereby kinetic energy over density and momentum fields is optimized subject to the mass conservation law. We develop proximal splitting methods, namely the Douglas-Rachford and Chambolle-Pock algorithms, which exploit the separable structure of the constraint set and require only simple proximal operations, and can accommodate additional (time-varying) spatial restrictions or obstacles. Numerical experiments illustrate the impact of the constraint on transport behavior, including congestion-aware spreading, rerouting, and convergence. The framework establishes a connection between optimal transport and macroscopic traffic flow theory and provides a scalable, variational tool for modeling congestion-constricted (or saturation-aware) Wasserstein gradient flow.</description>

      <title>VArsity: Can Large Language Models Keep Power Engineering Students in Phase?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an educational case study regarding our experience in deploying ChatGPT Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Spring 2025 and Fall 2023 offerings of ECE 4320: Power System Analysis and Control at Georgia Tech. As part of course assessments, students were tasked with identifying, explaining, and correcting errors in the ChatGPT outputs corresponding to power factor correction problems. While most students successfully identified the errors in the outputs from the GPT-4 version of ChatGPT used in Fall 2023, students found the errors from the ChatGPT o1 version much more difficult to identify in Spring 2025. As shown in this case study, the role of LLMs in pedagogy, assessment, and learning in power engineering classrooms is an important topic deserving further investigation.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach to approximate the dynamics of a nonlinear time-varying system (NTVS) by a linear time-varying system (LTVS), which is resulted from the Koopman operator and deep neural networks. Analysis of the approximation error between states of the NTVS and the resulting LTVS is presented. Simulations on a representative NTVS show that the proposed method achieves small approximation errors, even when the system changes rapidly. Furthermore, simulations in an example of quadcopters demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Aggregate Flexibility of Electric Vehicles Charging Stations for Dependable Congestion Management Products -- A Dutch Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by increased charging needs and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it quantifies the collective ability to provide dependable congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probabilistic ability to offer different flexibility products, namely, redispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed for different categories of charging stations (CS) and dispatch strategies. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. Further, it is shown how machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the day-ahead consumption, followed by operationally predicting redispatch flexibility. The findings demonstrate that the timing of EV arrivals, departures, and connections plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of product offerings, and dependable services can generally be delivered using a sufficiently large number of CSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript considers the problem of ensuring stability and safety during formation control with distributed multi-agent systems in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the dynamics and limited communication. We propose an integrative approach that combines Adaptive Control, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and connected graphs. The main elements employed in the integrative approach are an adaptive control design that ensures stability, a CBF-based safety filter that generates safe commands based on a reference model dynamics, and a reference model that ensures formation control with multi-agent systems when no uncertainties are present. The overall control design is shown to lead to a closed-loop adaptive system that is stable, avoids unsafe regions, and converges to a desired formation of the multi-agents. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Leaning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for massive-scale systems consisting of large populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments has witnessed a significant surge in recent years across diverse scientific domains. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often results in high computational costs or compromised performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture along with the derivation of effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such a system as a parameterized control system defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform to map the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, which are organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. We further enhance the efficiency of the algorithm by exploiting early stopping at each hierarchy, which demonstrates the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, an input-output economic model with multiple interactive economic systems is considered. The model captures the multi-dimensional nature of the economic sectors or industries in each economic system, the interdependencies among industries within an economic system and across different economic systems, and the influence of demand. To determine the equilibrium price structure of the model, a matrix-weighted updating algorithm is proposed. The equilibrium price structure is proved to be globally asymptotically achieved when certain joint conditions on the matrix-weighted graph and the input-output matrices are satisfied. The theoretical results are then supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective parking management is essential for ensuring safety and convenience in master-planned communities, particularly in active adult neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth. Accurately assessing parking utilization is a crucial first step in planning for future demand, but data collection methods can be costly and labor-intensive. This paper presents a low-cost yet highly accurate methodology for measuring parking utilization using pneumatic road tubes connected to portable traffic counters from JAMAR Technologies, Inc. By integrating results from JAMAR's analysis tool with custom Python scripting, the methodology enables precise parking lot counts through automated parameter optimization and error correction. The system's efficiency allows for scalable deployment without significant manual observation, reducing both costs and disruptions to daily operations. Using Tellico Village as a case study, this effort demonstrates that community planners can obtain actionable parking insights on a limited budget, empowering them to make informed decisions about capacity expansion and facility scheduling.</description>

      <title>Restoring Feasibility in Power Grid Optimization: A Counterfactual ML Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric power grids are essential components of modern life, delivering reliable power to end-users while adhering to a multitude of engineering constraints and requirements. In grid operations, the Optimal Power Flow problem plays a key role in determining cost-effective generator dispatch that satisfies load demands and operational limits. However, due to stressed operating conditions, volatile demand profiles, and increased generation from intermittent energy sources, this optimization problem may become infeasible, posing risks such as voltage instability and line overloads. This study proposes a learning framework that combines machine learning with counterfactual explanations to automatically diagnose and restore feasibility in the OPF problem. Our method provides transparent and actionable insights by methodically identifying infeasible conditions and suggesting minimal demand response actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on IEEE 30-bus and 300-bus systems, demonstrating its capability to recover feasibility with high success rates and generating diverse corrective options, appropriate for real-time decision-making. These preliminary findings illustrate the potential of combining classical optimization with explainable AI techniques to enhance grid reliability and resilience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel state estimation approach integrating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE). This is a shift from using traditional physics-based models within MHE towards data-driven techniques. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based DNN is trained using synthetic data derived from a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM), applied within a thermal derating torque control strategy for battery electric vehicles. The trained DNN is directly embedded within an MHE formulation, forming a discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP) solved via the acados optimization framework. Model-in-the-Loop simulations demonstrate accurate temperature estimation even under noisy sensor conditions and simulated sensor failures. Real-time implementation on embedded hardware confirms practical feasibility, achieving computational performance exceeding real-time requirements threefold. By integrating the learned LSTM-based dynamics directly into MHE, this work achieves state estimation accuracy, robustness, and adaptability while reducing modeling efforts and complexity. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness of combining model-based and data-driven methods in safety-critical automotive control systems.</description>

      <title>Conformal Safety Shielding for Imperfect-Perception Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in local safety. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Mean Field Framework for Aggregators Participating in Wholesale Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.</description>

      <title>Learning Koopman Models From Data Under General Noise Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel identification approach of Koopman models of nonlinear systems with inputs under rather general noise conditions. The method uses deep state-space encoders based on the concept of state reconstructability and an efficient multiple-shooting formulation of the squared loss of the prediction error to estimate the dynamics and the lifted state from input-output data. Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an innovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise. It is shown that the proposed approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient due to the multiple-shooting formulation where, on subsections of the data, multi-step prediction errors can be calculated in parallel. The latter allows for efficient batch optimization of the network parameters and, at the same time, excellent long-term prediction capabilities of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by nonlinear benchmark examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is an expository paper which discusses an approach to the LQG/LTR design problem for finite-dimensional SISO control systems. The approach is based on the utilisation of weighting augmentation for incorporating design specifications into the framework of the LTR technique for LQG compensator design. The LQG compensator is to simultaneously meet given analytical low- and high-frequency design specifications expressed in terms of desirable sensitivity and controller noise sensitivity functions. The paper is aimed at nonspecialists and, in particular, practitioners in finite-dimensional LQG theory interested in the design of feedback compensators for closed-loop performance and robustness shaping of SISO control systems in realistic situations. The proposed approach is illustrated by a detailed numerical example: the torque control of a current-controlled DC motor with an elastically mounted rotor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic Nash equilibrium problems subject to heterogeneous uncertainty on the expected valued cost functions of the individual agents, where we assume no prior knowledge of the underlying probability distributions of the uncertain variables. To account for this lack of knowledge, we consider an ambiguity set around the empirical probability distribution under the Wasserstein metric. We then show that, under mild assumptions, finite-sample guarantees on the probability that any resulting distributionally robust Nash equilibrium is also robust with respect to the true probability distributions with high confidence can be obtained. Furthermore, by recasting the game as a distributionally robust variational inequality, we establish asymptotic consistency of the set of data-driven distributionally robust equilibria to the solution set of the original game. Finally, we recast the distributionally robust Nash game as a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We illustrate the proposed distributionally robust reformulation via numerical experiments of stochastic peer-to-peer electricity markets and Nash-Cournot games.</description>

      <title>Competency-Aware Planning for Probabilistically Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06111v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>Safe and Real-Time Consistent Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in Partially Observed Environments via Parallel Consensus Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and driving consistency is a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles operating in partially observed environments. This work introduces a consistent parallel trajectory optimization (CPTO) approach to enable safe and consistent driving in dense obstacle environments with perception uncertainties. Utilizing discrete-time barrier function theory, we develop a consensus safety barrier module that ensures reliable safety coverage within the spatiotemporal trajectory space across potential obstacle configurations. Following this, a bi-convex parallel trajectory optimization problem is derived that facilitates decomposition into a series of low-dimensional quadratic programming problems to accelerate computation. By leveraging the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parallel optimization, each generated candidate trajectory corresponds to a possible environment configuration while sharing a common consensus trajectory segment. This ensures driving safety and consistency when executing the consensus trajectory segment for the ego vehicle in real time. We validate our CPTO framework through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines across multiple driving tasks in partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate improved safety and consistency using both synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponential stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and diffusion policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</description>

      <title>Ordering and refining path-complete Lyapunov functions through composition lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fruitful approach to study stability of switched systems is to look for multiple Lyapunov functions. However, in general, we do not yet understand the interplay between the desired stability certificate, the template of the Lyapunov functions and their mutual relationships to accommodate switching. In this work we elaborate on path-complete Lyapunov functions: a graphical framework that aims to elucidate this interplay. In particular, previously, several preorders were introduced to compare multiple Lyapunov functions. These preorders are initially algorithmically intractable due to the algebraic nature of Lyapunov inequalities, yet, lifting techniques were proposed to turn some preorders purely combinatorial and thereby eventually tractable. In this note we show that a conjecture in this area regarding the so-called composition lift, that was believed to be true, is false. This refutal, however, points us to a beneficial structural feature of the composition lift that we exploit to iteratively refine path-complete graphs, plus, it points us to a favourable adaptation of the composition lift.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AI System Resiliency: Formulation and Guarantee for LSTM Resilience Based on Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for guaranteeing and evaluating the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in control systems. We introduce "recovery time" as a new metric of resilience in order to quantify the time required for an LSTM to return to its normal state after anomalous inputs. By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>BEAVER: Building Environments with Assessable Variation for Evaluating Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy learning process.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning in Continuous Action Spaces: Mitigating Compounding Error without Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning. When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e., predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered in isolation.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20\%, 1.28\%, and 8\% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>

      <title>A Step-by-step Guide on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Safe Mobile Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements. Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC (LMPC), NMPC, and their applications in various domains, including robotics. This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation. The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations and real-world robotic applications.
