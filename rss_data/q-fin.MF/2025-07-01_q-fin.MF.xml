      <title>Explicit local volatility formula for Cheyette-type interest rate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytical approximation for the local volatility function in the Cheyette interest rate model, extending the classical Dupire framework to fixed-income markets. The result expresses local volatility in terms of time and strike derivatives of the Bachelier implied variance, naturally generalizes to multi-factor Cheyette models, and provides a practical tool for model calibration.</description>

      <title>Robust No-Arbitrage under Projective Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on set theory, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the structural condition of mathematical finance under Knightian uncertainty. We adopt a projective framework in which all components of the model -- prices, priors and trading strategies -- are treated uniformly in terms of measurability. This contrasts with the quasi-sure setting of Bouchard and Nutz, in which prices are Borel-measurable and graphs of local priors are analytic sets, while strategies and stochastic kernels inherit only universal measurability. In our projective framework, we establish several characterizations of the robust no-arbitrage condition, already known in the quasi-sure setting, but under significantly more elegant and consistent assumptions. These characterisations have important applications, in particular, the existence of solutions to the robust utility maximization problem. To do this, we work within the classical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), augmented by the axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD). The (PD) axiom, a well-established axiom of descriptive set theory, guarantees strong regularity properties for projective sets and projective functions.</description>

      <title>Relative portfolio optimization via a value at risk based constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $n$ agents who invest in a general financial market that is free of arbitrage and complete. The aim of each investor is to maximize her expected utility while ensuring, with a specified probability, that her terminal wealth exceeds a benchmark defined by her competitors' performance. This setup introduces an interdependence between agents, leading to a search for Nash equilibria. In the case of two agents and CRRA utility, we are able to derive all Nash equilibria in terms of terminal wealth. For $n&gt;2$ agents and logarithmic utility we distinguish two cases. In the first case, the probabilities in the constraint are small and we can characterize all Nash equilibria. In the second case, the probabilities are larger and we look for Nash equilibria in a certain set. We also discuss the impact of the competition using some numerical examples. As a by-product, we solve some portfolio optimization problems with probability constraints.</description>
