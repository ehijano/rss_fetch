      <title>On Weighted Arboricity: Conductance-Resistance Bounds and Monoid Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a conductance-weighted Nash--Williams density for a finite simple undirected graph $G=(V,E,c)$ with a conductance assignment $c:E\to[0,\infty)$: \[ A_c(G):=\max\bigl\{ D_c(H): H\subseteq G\text{ connected}, |V(H)|\ge 2 \bigr\},\qquad D_c(H):=\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)}{|V(H)|-1}. \] This functional reduces to the classical Nash--Williams density when $c\equiv 1$, isomorphism invariant, monotone under subgraphs and edge additions, positively homogeneous, and convex. We prove sharp global bounds \[ \max_{e\in E}c(e)\le A_c(G)\le\sum_{e\in E}c(e), \] with attainment by some connected subgraph. On the analytic side, we introduce a local variant and derive conductance--resistance inequalities using effective resistances in the ambient network. If $R_G(e)$ denotes the effective resistance between the endpoints of $e$ in $G$, we show that every connected $H\subseteq G$ satisfies \[ \sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)\,R_G(e)\le |V(H)|-1, \] which in turn yields the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality \[ D_c(H)\le\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)/R_G(e)}{|V(H)|-1}} \] and hence an explicit resistance-based upper bound on $A_c(G)$. On the structural side, we describe the algebraic behavior of $A_c(G)$. We show that under edge-disjoint union, $A_c(G)$ behaves as a max invariant: for a finite disjoint union of weighted graphs one has $A_c(G)= \max_i A_{c_i}(G_i)$. In particular, disjoint union induces a commutative idempotent monoid structure at the level of isomorphism classes, with $A_c(G)$ idempotent with respect to this operation.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n x n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. This reveals a connection between magic square constraints and statistical structure: we prove that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We introduce a covariance energy functional -- the sum of squared covariances with row, column, and diagonal indicator variables -- and prove for n=3 (via exhaustive enumeration) that its zeros are precisely the magic squares. Large-scale sampling for n=4,5 (460+ million arrangements) provides strong numerical evidence that this characterization extends to larger orders. Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D_4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>On the analogue of Esperet's conjecture: Characterizing hereditary classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper [J. Graph Theory (2023) 102:458-471, the Esperet's conjecture has been posed: Every $\chi$-bounded hereditary class is poly-$\chi$-bounded]. This conjecture was first posed in [Habilitation Thesis, Universit\'e Grenoble Alpes, 24, 2017]. This is adapted from the Gy\'arf\'as--Sumner's conjecture which has been asserted in [The Theory and Applications of Graphs, (G. Chartrand, ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981, pp. 557-576].
  Although the Esperet's conjecture is false in general, in this study we consider an analogue of Esperet's conjecture as follows: Let $C$ be a hereditary class of graphs, and $d \ge 1$. Suppose that there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(G) \le f(\tau_d(G))$ for each $G \in C$. Can we always choose $f$ to be a polynomial? We investigate this conjecture by focusing on specific classes of graphs. This work identifies hereditary graph classes that do not contain specific induced subdivisions of claws and confirms that they adhere to the stated conjecture.</description>

      <title>Towards Esperet's Conjecture: Polynomial $\chi$-Bounds for Structured Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the class of $\{P_6, (2,2)\text{-broom}\}$-free graphs contains a subclass $\mathcal{L}_i$, defined by certain cutset conditions, whose chromatic number admits a linear $\chi$-bound. Building on recent results showing that broom-free graphs excluding $K_d(t)$ as a subgraph admit a polynomial bound in~$t$ on their chromatic number (A broom is obtained from a path with one end $v$ by adding leaves adjacent to $v$), we extend this result to the hereditary class $\mathcal{H}$ of $C_4$-free and \emph{$p$-flag}-free graphs (where a \emph{$p$-flag} is a triangle with an attached $p$-path). We show that if $G \in \mathcal{H}$ is $B^{+}(p+2, t-1)$-free (for $p \ge 2$ and $t \ge 3$, that is, if it excludes a generalized broom with an additional leaf), and does not contain $K_d(t)$ as a subgraph, then $\chi(G)$ is polynomially bounded in $t$. Furthermore, for the subclass of $\mathcal{H}$ excluding $K_3(t)$ as a subgraph, we prove that $\chi(G)$ is linearly $\chi$-bounded in $\omega(G)$.</description>

      <title>Oriented Hamiltonian Paths in Tournaments: Stability under Arc Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Havet and Thomass\'{e} proved that every tournament of order $n\geq 8$ contains every oriented Hamiltonian path, which was conjectured by Rosenfeld. Recently, it was shown that in any tournament $T$ of order $n\geq 8$, there exists an arc $e$ such that $T-e$ contains any oriented Hamiltonian path. A natural extension of this problem is to study the stability of this property under arbitrary arc deletion. In this paper, we prove that every arc $e$ in a tournament $T$ of order $n\geq 8$ satisfies that $T-e$ contains every oriented Hamiltonian path, except for some explicitly described exceptions.</description>

      <title>Coloring Geometric Hypergraphs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{chromatic number} of a hypergraph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no edge of at least two vertices is monochromatic. Given a family of geometric objects $\mathcal{F}$ that covers a subset $S$ of the Euclidean space, we can associate it with a hypergraph whose vertex set is $\mathcal F$ and whose edges are those subsets ${\mathcal{F}'}\subset \mathcal F$ for which there exists a point $p\in S$ such that ${\mathcal F}'$ consists of precisely those elements of $\mathcal{F}$ that contain $p$. The question whether $\mathcal F$ can be split into 2 coverings is equivalent to asking whether the chromatic number of the hypergraph is equal to 2.
  There are a number of competing notions of the chromatic number that lead to deep combinatorial questions already for abstract hypergraphs. In this paper, we concentrate on \emph{geometrically defined} (in short, \emph{geometric}) hypergraphs, and survey many recent coloring results related to them. In particular, we study and survey the following problem, dual to the above covering question. Given a set of points $S$ in the Euclidean space and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of geometric objects of a fixed type, define a hypergraph ${\mathcal H}_m$ on the point set $S$, whose edges are the subsets of $S$ that can be obtained as the intersection of $S$ with a member of $\mathcal F$ and have at least $m$ elements. Is it true that if $m$ is large enough, then the chromatic number of ${\mathcal H}_m$ is equal to 2?</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Complexes of induced $k$-independent graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the neighborhood complexes of the induced $k$-independent graphs. Inspired by the surprising correspondence between total $k$-cut complex of $n$-cycle $C_n$ and neighborhood complex of stable Kneser graph $SG(n,k)$, we anticipate that the homotopy type of total cut complexes may have some relationships with the neighborhood complexes of induced $k$-independent graphs. We investigated the homotopy type of some total cut complexes and neighborhood complexes of some other graphs, using techniques from algebraic topology and discrete Morse theory.</description>

      <title>The non-existence of some Moore polygons and spectral Moore bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum order $v(k,\theta)$ of a connected $k$-regular graph whose second largest eigenvalue is at most $\theta$. From Alon-Boppana and Serre, we know that $v(k,\theta)$ is finite when $\theta &lt; 2\sqrt{k-1}$ while the work of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava implies that $v(k,\theta)$ is infinite if $\theta\geq 2\sqrt{k-1}$. Cioab\u{a}, Koolen, Nozaki, and Vermette obtained a general upper bound on $v(k, \theta)$ via Nozaki's linear programming bound and determined many values of $v(k,\theta)$. The graphs attaining this bound are distance-regular and are called Moore polygons. Damerell and Georgiacodis proved that there are no Moore polygons of diameter $6$ or more. For smaller diameters, there are infinitely many Moore polygons.
  We complement these results by proving two nonexistence results for Moore polygons with specific parameters. We also determine new values of $v(k,\theta)$: $v(4, \sqrt{2}) = 14$ and $v(5, \sqrt{2}) = v(5,\sqrt{5}-1)=16$. The former is achieved by the co-Heawood graph, and the latter by the folded $5$-cube. We verify that any connected $5$-regular graph with second eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ exceeding $1$ satisfies $\lambda_2 \geq \sqrt{5} - 1$, and that the unique $5$-regular graph attaining equality in this bound has $10$ vertices. We prove a stronger form of a 2015 conjecture of Kolokolnikov related to the second eigenvalue of cubic graphs of given order, and observe that other recent results on the second eigenvalue of regular graphs are consequences of the general upper bound theorem on $v(k,\theta)$ mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Minuscule Coxeter Dressians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this extended abstract, we study special tropical prevarieties which we call Coxeter Dressians. They arise from equations capturing a generalization of valuated symmetric basis exchange for Coxeter matroids. In particular, we study subdivisions of the associated Coxeter matroid polytopes. We show that the subdivisions induced by points of the Coxeter Dressian consist of cells which are strong Coxeter matroidal. This generalizes well-known results in type $A$ to other Lie types. Finally, we implement explicit computations of Coxeter Dressians in OSCAR.</description>

      <title>Anti-Ramsey Number of Stars in 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored hypergraph is called \emph{a rainbow hypergraph} if all the colors on its edges are distinct. Given two positive integers $n,r$ and an $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{G}$, the anti-Ramsey number $ar_r(n,\mathcal{G})$ is defined to be the minimum number of colors $t$ such that there exists a rainbow copy of $\mathcal{G}$ in any exactly $t$-edge-coloring of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph of order $n$. Let $ \mathcal{F}_k $ denote the 3-graph ($k$-star) consisting of $k$ edges sharing exactly one vertex. Tang, Li and Yan \cite{YTG} determined the value of $ar_3(n,\mathcal{F}_3)$ when $n\geq 20$. In this paper, we determine the anti-Ramsey number $ar_3(n,\mathcal{F}_{k+1})$, where $k\geq 3$ and $n&gt; \frac{5}{2}k^3+\frac{15}{2}k^2+26k-3$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity Bounds for Arbitrary Eigenvalues of Connected Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of eigenvalue multiplicities plays a central role in the spectral theory of signed graphs, extending several classical results from the unsigned setting. While most existing work focuses on the nullity of a signed graph (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $0$), much less is known for arbitrary eigenvalues. In this paper, we establish a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity $m(G_\sigma, \lambda)$ of any real eigenvalue $\lambda$ of a connected signed graph $G_\sigma$ in terms of its girth. Our main result shows that \[ m(G_\sigma, \lambda) \le n - g(G_\sigma) + 2, \] where $n$ is the number of vertices and $g(G_\sigma)$ is the girth. We prove that equality holds if and only if $G_\sigma$ is switching equivalent to one of the following extremal families: \begin{itemize}
  \item[(i)] a balanced complete graph with $\lambda = -1$;
  \item[(ii)] an antibalanced complete graph with $\lambda = 1$; or
  \item[(iii)] a balanced complete bipartite graph with $\lambda = 0$. \end{itemize} This fully extends and generalizes the known result for the nullity case ($\lambda = 0$), originally due to Wu et al.\ (2022), to the entire eigenvalue spectrum. Our approach combines Cauchy interlacing, switching equivalence, and a structural analysis of induced cycles in signed graphs. We also provide a characterization of eigenvalues with multiplicity $1$ and $2$ for signed cycles, and include examples illustrating the sharpness and spectral behavior of the extremal families.</description>

      <title>Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, i.e., graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Random Walk on graphs, loop processes and graphings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the Uniform Random Walk (URW) on a connected, locally finite graph as the weak limit of the uniform walk of length $n$ starting at a fixed vertex. When the limit exists, it is necessarily Markovian and is independent of the starting point. For a finite graph, URW equals the Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW).
  We investigate the existence and phase transitions of URW for loop perturbed regular graphs and their limits. It turns out that for a sequence of finite graphs, it is the global spectral theory of the limiting graphing that governs the behavior of the finite MERWs.
  In the delocalized phase, we use a "membrane argument", showing that the principal eigenfunction of an expander graphing is stable under a small diagonal perturbation. This gives us: 1) The existence of URW on leaves; 2) The URW is a unique entropy maximizer; 3) The MERW of a finite graph sequence Benjamini-Schramm converges to the URW of the limiting graphing.
  In the localized phase, the environment seen by the particle takes the role of a finite stationary measure. We show that for canopy trees, the URW exists, is transient and maximizes entropy. We also show that for large finite graphs where most vertices have a fixed degree, localization of MERW is governed by the adjacency norm.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for the moduli space of genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weil-Petersson volume of genus-g hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundaries is known since work of Mirzakhani to be polynomial in the boundary lengths. We provide a bijective proof of this fact in the genus-0 case in the presence of a distinguished cusp. It is based on a generalization of a recent tree bijection, by the first author and Curien, to the setting with geodesic boundaries, requiring an extension of the Bowditch-Epstein-Penner spine construction. As an application of our tree bijection we establish an explicit formula for the distance-dependent three-point function, which records an exact metric statistic measuring the difference of two geodesic distances among a triple of distinguished cusps in a Weil-Petersson random surface. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance of this function to the topological recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes and metric properties of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with many boundaries or cusps.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via matrix projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with angle $\arccos(\alpha)$ and gave a partial answer in the regime $r \leq 1/\alpha^2 - 2$. At the other extreme where $r$ is at least exponential in $1/\alpha$, recent breakthroughs have led to an almost complete resolution of this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new method for obtaining upper bounds which unifies and improves upon previous approaches, thereby yielding bounds which bridge the gap between the aforementioned regimes and are best possible either exactly or up to a small multiplicative constant. Our approach relies on orthogonal projection of matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product and as a byproduct, it yields the first extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs, with equality for strongly regular graphs corresponding to $\binom{r+1}{2}$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$. Applications of our method in the complex setting will be discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the Fourier entropy of an $n$-dimensional boolean function $f$ can be upper-bounded by $O(I(f)+ \sum\limits_{k\in[n]}I_k(f)\log \frac{1}{I_k(f)})$, where $I(f)$ is its total influence and $I_k(f)$ is the influence of the $k$-th coordinate. The proof is elementary and uses iterative bounds on moments of Fourier coefficients over different levels.</description>

Abstract: For affine Coxeter groups of affine types $\tilde D$ and $\tilde B$, we model the interval $[1,c]_T$ in the absolute order by symmetric noncrossing partitions of an annulus with one or two double points. In type $\tilde B$ (and \emph{almost} in type $\tilde D$), the diagrams also model the larger lattice defined by McCammond and Sulway.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the principal minors of the distance matrix of a tree satisfy a combinatorial expression involving counts of rooted spanning forests of the underlying tree. This generalizes a result of Graham and Pollak, and refines a result of Graham and Lov\'asz on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the distance matrix. We also give such an expression for the case of trees with edge lengths. We use arguments motivated by potential theory on graphs. Our formulas can be expressed in terms of evaluations of Symanzik polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $GQ$ functions are symmetric functions indexed by strict partitions that represent $K$-theoretic Schubert classes in the Lagrangian Grassmannian. Buch and Ravikumar proved a Pieri rule for expanding $GQ_{\lambda}\cdot GQ_p$ in terms of $GQ$s via certain shifted skew tableaux. In this paper we identify an alternative family of shifted tableaux that enumerates this Pieri rule. This partially resolves a conjecture from previous work that these tableaux enumerate the expansion of $GQ_{\lambda} \cdot GQ_{\tau}$ in terms of $GQ$s where $\tau$ is a trapezoid shape.</description>

Abstract: For a real number $c &gt; 4$, we prove that every graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) \leq 2$ and $|V(G)| \geq ct$ has a matching $M$ with $|M| = t$ such that the number of non-adjacent pairs of edges in $M$ is at most: \begin{equation*}
  \left( \frac{1}{c\left(c-1\right)^2} + O_c\left(t^{-1/3} \right) \right) \binom{t}{2}. \end{equation*} This is related to an open problem of Seymour (2016) about Hadwiger's Conjecture, who asked if there is a constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that every graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) \leq 2$ has $\text{had}(G) \geq (\frac{1}{3} + \varepsilon) |V(G)|$.</description>

      <title>A dimer view on Fox's trapezoidal conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, M\'esz\'aros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an (2024). In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's aforementioned beautiful result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view.</description>

Abstract: In this article we will introduce a central problem in additive combinatorics, which arised from the famous van der Waerden theorem and an early conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n. The first important theorem was due to Roth in 1953. There were a number of generalized or improved results afterwards, which we call Roth-type theorems. We will list them and try to give concise expositions to the ideas in some of the proofs without much prior knowledge.</description>

As a consequence, we show that a hereditary class of relational structures is NIP (resp. stable) if and only if it is monadically NIP (resp. monadically stable). As another consequence, we show that if such a class is not monadically NIP, then it has superexponential growth rate.</description>

      <title>Entropy Functions on Two-Dimensional Faces of Polymatroidal Region of Degree Four: Part I: Problem Formulation and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06250v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the 2-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region of degree 4. In Part I, we formulate the problem, enumerate all 59 types of 2-dimensional faces of the region by an algorithm, and fully characterize entropy functions on 49 types of them. Among them, those non-trivial cases are mainly characterized by the graph-coloring technique. The entropy functions on the remaining 10 types of faces will be characterized in Part II, among which 8 types are fully characterized, and 2 types are partially characterized.</description>

      <title>Flexible realizations existence: NP-completeness on sparse graphs and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the questions in Rigidity Theory is whether a realization of the vertices of a graph in the plane is flexible, namely, if it allows a continuous deformation preserving the edge lengths. A flexible realization of a connected graph in the plane exists if and only if the graph has a NAC-coloring, which is a surjective edge coloring by two colors such that for each cycle, either all the edges have the same color, or there are at least two edges of each color. The question whether a graph has a NAC-coloring, and hence also the existence of a flexible realization, has been proven to be NP-complete. We show that this question is also NP-complete on graphs with maximum degree five and on graphs with the average degree at most $4+\varepsilon$ for every fixed $\varepsilon &gt;0$. We also show that NAC-colorings can be counted in linear time for graphs with bounded treewidth. Since the only existing implementation of checking the existence of a NAC-coloring is rather naive, we propose new algorithms along with their implementation, which is significantly faster. We also focus on searching all NAC-colorings of a graph, since they provide useful information about its possible flexible realizations.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fuss-Catalan thresholds in graph bootstrap percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graph bootstrap percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$. For all $r \ge 5$, we locate the sharp $K_r$-percolation threshold $p_c \sim (\gamma n)^{-1/\lambda}$, solving a problem of Balogh, Bollob\'as and Morris. The case $r=3$ is the classical graph connectivity threshold, and the threshold for $r=4$ was found using strong connections with the well-studied $2$-neighbor dynamics from statistical physics. When $r \ge 5$, such connections break down, and the process exhibits much richer behavior. The constants $\lambda=\lambda(r)$ and $\gamma=\gamma(r)$ in $p_c$ are determined by a class of $\left({r\choose2}-1\right)$-ary tree-like graphs, which we call $K_r$-tree witness graphs. These graphs are associated with the most efficient ways of adding a new edge in the $K_r$-dynamics, and they can be counted using the Fuss-Catalan numbers. Also, in the subcritical setting, we determine the asymptotic number of edges added to ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$, showing that the edge density increases only by a constant factor, whose value we identify.</description>
