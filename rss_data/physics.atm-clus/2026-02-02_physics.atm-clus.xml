      <title>A Cross-Domain Graph Learning Protocol for Single-Step Molecular Geometry Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate molecular geometries are a prerequisite for reliable quantum-chemical predictions, yet density functional theory (DFT) optimization remains a major bottleneck for high-throughput molecular screening. Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-\AA{} all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\% under loose and 33.4\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows.</description>

      <title>The two-positron gluonic bond as a manifestation of "super" van der Waals interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been demonstrated theoretically that the interaction of two PsH atoms, each being a stable bound state of a hydrogen atom and a positronium atom, is attractive, leading to the formation of a molecular complex denoted as (PsH)2. However, the physical nature of this interaction has remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations. Notably, the interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects. Accordingly, the bond formed between PsH units, termed here a two-positron gluonic bond to emphasize its fundamentally distinct character from the two-positron covalent bonds present in pure antimatter molecules, emerges only when matter and antimatter particles form a common bound state. When classified within the framework of known bonding mechanisms, this gluonic bond falls into the category of stabilizing dispersion interactions, giving rise to a van der Waals complex. However, its remarkably large bond dissociation energy, compared with those of strongly bonded van der Waals complexes of similar size, reveals an anomalously strong interaction. For this reason, we propose that (PsH)2 is most appropriately described as a "super" van der Waals complex stabilized by a "super" van der Waals bond.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced Coulomb explosion of the LiI molecule and of its dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A gas-phase sample consisting of lithium iodide, $\mathrm{LiI}$, molecules and their dimer $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, are Coulomb exploded by an intense 25 femtosecond laser pulse. In the case of $\mathrm{LiI}$, we focus on the double ionization that creates a pair of $\mathrm{Li}^+$ and $\mathrm{I}^+$ recoil ions. From the kinetic energy distribution of the $\mathrm{Li}^+$ ions, extracted using coincidence filtering, we determine the distribution of internuclear distances $P(R)$ via the ground state potential curve of $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$ obtained from an ab initio calculation that accounts for non-Coulombic effects. We find that the center of $P(R)$ is close to the expected internuclear separation based on the three vibrational states of $\mathrm{LiI}$ populated, whereas the width of $P(R)$ exceeds the theoretical value by $\sim$ 52 %. We discuss if fragmentation via excited $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$ potential curves affects the determination of $P(R)$. In the case of the dimer, $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, we observe kinetic energies and relative emission directions of $\mathrm{Li}^+$, $\mathrm{I}^+$, and $\mathrm{I}^{2+}$ recoil ions consistent with Coulomb explosion of the parallelogram-shaped dimer after removing up to six electrons by the laser pulse.</description>
