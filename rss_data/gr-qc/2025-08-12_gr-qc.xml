      <title>Inverse Hamiltonian Reconstruction from Gravitational Energy Density in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for reconstructing effective Hamiltonians from known gravitational energy density profiles in curved spacetime. Starting from local thermal equilibrium and Liouville dynamics, we establish an inverse procedure that relates the macroscopic energy density \( \rho(x) \) to a distribution function \( f(x,p) \sim e^{-\beta H(x,p)} \), and recovers the underlying Hamiltonian \( H(x,p) \) via functional inversion. This approach synthesizes tools from relativistic kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and covariant gravitational thermodynamics, offering a systematic way to extract microscopic dynamics from coarse-grained energy observables. Applications include FLRW cosmology, Loop Quantum Gravity corrections, AdS/CFT holography, and the SYK model. Our results provide a novel route for probing emergent spacetime dynamics through observable densities, bridging geometry, entropy, and Hamiltonian flow in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Refined Thermodynamic Analysis of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter Black Holes in a Phantom Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the thermodynamics of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) by employing the Misner-Sharp energy framework. We extend the analysis to include the thermal fluctuations of these black holes when size reduces to small size, redefining key thermodynamic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, and entropy within the context of PFDM. Using these newly defined variables, we systematically calculate the enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat of PFDM black holes, incorporating perturbative thermal corrections. To assess the stability of these black holes, we perform a detailed graphical analysis of the specific heat as a function of the horizon radius, providing insights into the thermal stability of PFDM black holes. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the thermodynamic properties and stability of black holes in the presence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Cosmic Evolution: Insights from Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary aim of this work is to explore feasible bouncing cosmological solutions in the framework of $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{C})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}$ denotes non-metricity and $\mathcal{C}$ indicates the boundary term. To achieve this, we analyze the dynamics of a Bianchi type-I spacetime with perfect fluid distribution. We consider various functional forms of $f(\mathcal{Q,C})$ theory to assess how this modified gravity framework influences cosmic evolution. Additionally, we examine the dynamics of different cosmological parameters to explore non-singular bounce solutions. We also use linear perturbation to study the stability analysis. Our findings reveal the breach of the null energy conditions, which is required for the existence of viable bounce solutions. The equation of state parameter demonstrates either a quintessence phase or a phantom regime of the universe, demonstrating that the cosmos is undergoing accelerating expansion. This gravitational framework presents a promising alternative to the standard cosmological model, presenting an innovative viewpoint on gravitational interactions and the dynamics of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Hysteresis in Reconstructed \textit{f(R)} Bounce Models: A Thermodynamic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing universes within the framework of analytically reconstructed $f(R)$ gravity. Using exact bouncing scale factor solutions of exponential and power-law forms, we reconstruct the corresponding $f(R)$ models and investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a minimally coupled scalar field in these geometries. The pressure evolution during expansion and contraction phases is shown to be asymmetric, leading to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral over each cycle, defined by $\oint p_\phi\, dV$. We identify closed hysteresis loops in the equation-of-state space and quantify the net energy transfer per cycle. Our results reveal that such reconstructed $f(R)$ models generically support irreversible evolution, demonstrating a natural emergence of the thermodynamic arrow of time. These findings provide new insight into the dissipative features of modified gravity and the long-term dynamics of cyclic cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Conditional non-linear stability of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in the full subextremal range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the stability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes, in the full subextremal range, as solutions of the vacuum Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant under the assumption that mode stability holds for these spacetimes. The method is similar to the (unconditional) proof in the slowly rotating case by Hintz and Vasy. The key novelties are the implementation of constraint damping in the full subextremal range as well as the verification of a subprincipal symbol condition at the trapped set.</description>

      <title>Deflection of Light and Thermodynamics of Einstein-Dyonic-ModMax Black Holes under GUP and Plasma Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Dyonic-ModMax (EDM) black holes (BHs) incorporating quantum gravity corrections and plasma effects. The ModMax theory promotes the classical Maxwell theory to a non-linear electrodynamics with a larger symmetry structure (electromagnetic duality plus conformal invariance), and provides dyonic BH solutions characterized by both electric and magnetic charges modulated by the nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism, we derive the Hawking radiation spectrum and demonstrate how the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) modifies the thermal emission, potentially leading to stable remnants. Our analysis of gravitational lensing employs the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to compute light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, revealing strong dependencies on the ModMax parameter and plasma density. We extend this to axion-plasmon environments, uncovering frequency-dependent modifications that could serve as dark matter signatures. The photon motion analysis in plasma media shows how the exponential damping term $e^{-\gamma}$ affects electromagnetic backreaction on spacetime geometry. We compute quantum-corrected thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, pressure, and heat capacity, using exponentially modified entropy models. The heat capacity exhibits second-order phase transitions with critical points shifting as functions of $\gamma$, indicating rich thermodynamic phase structures. Energy condition analysis reveals violations in near-horizon regions, characteristic of exotic matter supporting these geometries.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Inflation with Hubble Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been persistent suggestions, based on several diverse data sets, that the cosmic expansion is not exactly isotropic. It is not easy to develop a coherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard General Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of the very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm basis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which Inflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\,$ this, of course, includes the vast majority of such theories -- $\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that spacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is completely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the ``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be confirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from the outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly metric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far the most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm predictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the degree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Pantheon+ supernova data suggests evidence of sign-changing pressure of the cosmological fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit/reinterpret/extend the model-independent analysis method (which we now call spread - luminosity distance fitting, spread-LDF) from our previous work. We apply it to the updated supernova type Ia catalogue, Pantheon+ and recent GRB compilations. The procedure allows us, using only FLRW assumption, to construct good approximations for expansion history of the universe, re-confirming its acceleration to be a robust feature. When we also assume General Relativity ("GR"), we can demonstrate, without any matter/energy model in mind, the need for (possibly nonconstant) dark energy ("GDE"). We find hints for positive pressure of GDE at z&gt;1 with implications on either the complexity of dark energy, or the validity of one of the cosmological principle, interpretation of SN Ia data, or GR.</description>

      <title>Confronting General Relativity with Principal Component Analysis: Simulations and Results from GWTC-3 Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational wave signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Ringdowns as Sources and Detectors of Quantum Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is gravity quantum mechanical? If so, we argue that nonlinear effects in black hole ringdowns - notably second harmonic generation - generates gravitational waves in non-classical states. While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures and polarized images of rotating charged black holes in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the shadow images of rotating charged black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, using an accretion disk that is both optically and geometrically thin and located on the equatorial plane as the light source model. The results show that, compared to Sgr A*, the observational data of M87* impose stronger constraints on the charge parameter Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter G. Under the thin accretion disk model, a larger observer inclination theta_o deforms the inner shadow into a hat-like structure. The parameters (a, Q, G) mainly affect the size of the inner shadow and the brightness of the critical curve, where increasing these parameters reduces the shadow size and enhances the distinguishability of the critical curve. In the retrograde accretion disk case, the gravitational redshift significantly reduces the observed brightness of the image. In addition, we compute the distribution of the redshift factor on the projection screen. The results indicate that the Doppler effect induced by large theta_o enhances the blueshift in the image, while the light emitted by particles plunging into the black hole leads to strong redshift near the inner shadow. Finally, we study the polarization images under synchrotron radiation and find that the polarization intensity P_o reaches its maximum around the lensed image and higher-order images, whereas no polarization vectors appear within the inner shadow. This stands in sharp contrast to horizonless compact objects. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the shadow properties of charged black holes within Lorentz-violating gravity.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild-AdS Black Holes with Cloud of Strings and Quintessence: Geodesics, Thermodynamic Topology, and Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a Schwarzschild-anti de-Sitter black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CoS) possessing both electric- and magnetic-like components of the string bivector, embedded in a Kiselev-type quintessence fluid (QF). We analyze the dynamics of photons and test particles, focusing on trajectories, photon spheres, BH shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), highlighting how CoS and QF parameters affect these features. We then examine the thermodynamic topology of the system by analyzing vector field zeros, showing that varying CoS leads to distinct topological configurations with total charges of either $0$ or $+1$, corresponding to known classes like RN and AdS-RN. Additionally, we study scalar field dynamics via the massless Klein-Gordon equation, reformulated into a Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger-like form to derive the effective potential. We compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar perturbations, showing how CoS and QF influence oscillation frequencies and damping rates, with implications for gravitational confinement and thermalization in the AdS/CFT context.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Mass Shell Model for Compact Binaries with Observed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study modeled coalescing compact binaries as a spinning and contracting mass shell geometry, reinterpreting the effective one-body model. Besides obtaining the respective waveform profiles that include rates of change in binary separation and orbital frequency, an expression for the mass-shell surface energy was derived to compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves. In this study, we revisit the surface energy derivation using a variational method that was recently used, and we recover the energy's dependence on the compact binary's reduced mass, symmetric mass ratio, and the normalized rotational speed at merger. For 31 out of 93 cataloged GW events within the O1, O2 and O3 observation runs, we compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves and compare these values with the observed energy, either directly measured or extracted from the total-minus-remnant mass difference. It is shown that the model presented in this work agrees well with observed energy measurements, within the error range and via 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ across 29 example events (the mean value of these 29 ratios being $0.941$), with GW190403_051519 serving as an outlier with the 1:1 ratio of $0.462$, demonstrating the precision and universality of the energy expression to be applied to current and future detections.</description>

      <title>Conditions for positivity of energy in superrenormalizable polynomial gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the quantum level, the polynomial models of gravity with six and eight derivatives are superrenormalizable, but suffer from higher derivative ghost and/or tachyonic ghost states. On the other hand, these models may have advantages in the control of negative effects of ghosts, compared to the more common fourth-derivative theory. We explore the positiveness of energy of the individual plane wave solutions in the general models with six and eight derivatives. Different from the fourth-order gravity, the part of the energy which may be seen as the leading one in the UV, is positively defined in the tensor sector. We extend this investigation to the scalar sectors of the free theory.</description>

Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing effects of black holes with quantum hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, stationary black holes are uniquely characterized by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. In this paper, we explore quantum hair by deriving the quantum-corrected black hole metric within the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky formalism. The quantum-corrected metric is obtained perturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity between the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal Gauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this metric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute the associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular separation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum hair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the nonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong deflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the angular separation decreases. In addition, the role of quantum hair is discussed in the weak and strong naked singularities. As a result, we demonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but also its strong gravitational lensing effects.</description>

      <title>Interior instability of naked singularities of a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $k$-self-similar naked singularity solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Scalar field system are unstable to black hole formation under perturbations that are totally supported in the interior region, in all regularities strictly below the threshold. The instability below the threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that general naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV perturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on the exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface formation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel approach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming null cones becoming more and more singular.</description>

      <title>Memory Effects and Entanglement Dynamics of Finite time Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a smooth trajectory in Minkowski spacetime that is inertial in the asymptotic past and future but undergoes approximately uniform acceleration for a finite duration. In a suitable limit, this trajectory reduces to the standard Rindler trajectory, reproducing the expected Bogoliubov transformations and results consistent with the thermal time hypothesis. We analyze the behavior of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector following such a trajectory and explore the dependence of complete positivity (CP) divisibility on the detector's frequency, acceleration, and the duration of acceleration. Notably, we find that the detector exhibits a memory effect due to the finite duration of acceleration, which is also quantified by the Fisher information. We further examine two UDW detectors along various trajectory combinations and show that, unlike the transition rate, both the total correlation and the entanglement harvested return smoothly to their initial values after the acceleration/deceleration phase. These correlation measures behave similarly in both accelerating and decelerating segments. Interestingly, negativity and mutual information remain unaffected by the memory effect. We also discuss the physical significance of the sign of the flux of acceleration-induced radiation.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents, Phase Transitions, and Chaos Bound of ModMax AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic phase transition of ModMax anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes using Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular orbits. Our results demonstrate that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent serves as an efficient probe of the black hole's phase structure. We calculate the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent across the transition and show that it acts as an order parameter, exhibiting a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$ in the vicinity of the critical point. Furthermore, we explore the violation of the chaos bound, finding that the bound is violated when the horizon radius falls below a threshold value. We also examine how the ModMax parameter and the particle's angular momentum modify this threshold, revealing their role in controlling the onset of chaos bound violation.</description>

      <title>Inflation and Dark Energy from Loop Quantum Kaluza-Klein Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The five-dimensional loop quantum Kaluza-Klein cosmology is constructed based on the symmetric reduction of the connection formulation of the full theory. Through semiclassical analysis, the effective scalar constraint for the cosmological model coupled with a dust field is derived, incorporating the quantum fluctuations of geometry as a subleading order correction. It demonstrates that the quantum model has the correct classical limit. The explicit solutions to the equations of motion show that the classical big bang and past big rip singularities in the classical model are avoided by a quantum bounce and a quantum collapse respectively in the effective model. In a particular scenario, the dynamical compactification of the extra dimension is realized, while the observable four-dimensional universe transitions through three distinct epochs: (i) a super-inflationary phase generating 55 e-folds with particular choices of the initial value, (ii) a decelerated expansion era, and (iii) a late-time accelerated expansion phase driven by quantum fluctuations. These results suggest that both cosmic inflation and dark energy may originate from the interplay between the compactified extra dimension and quantum geometric effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08006v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Critical Collapse in Infinite Dimensions: Continuous Self-Similar Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10590v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of black hole critical collapse in the limit of a large number of spacetime dimensions, $D$. In particular, we study the spherical gravitational collapse of a massless, scale-invariant scalar field with continuous self-similarity (CSS). The large number of dimensions provides a natural separation of scales, simplifying the equations of motion at each scale where different effects dominate. With this approximation scheme, we construct matched asymptotic solutions for this family, including the critical solution. We then compute the mass critical exponent of the black hole for linear perturbations that break CSS, finding that it asymptotes to a constant value in infinite dimensions. Additionally, we present a link between these solutions and closed Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) cosmologies with a dimension-dependent equation of state and cosmological constant. The critical solution corresponds to an unstable Einstein-like universe, while subcritical and supercritical solutions correspond to bouncing and crunching cosmologies respectively. Our results provide a proof of concept for the large-$D$ expansion as a powerful analytic tool in gravitational collapse and suggest potential extensions to other self-similar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian holography is a framework for flat space holography, suggesting that gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime in $D$ dimensions is dual to a conformal Carrollian field theory in $D - 1$ dimensions living at null infinity. In this work, we elaborate on the definition of Carrollian amplitudes for massless scalar fields in general dimensions and provide explicit expressions for the two-, three-, and four-point functions. We show that these amplitudes naturally arise from Lorentzian holographic correlators in AdS/CFT through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Finally, we use the relation between Carrollian and celestial holography to derive explicit expressions for celestial amplitudes in $D$ dimensions, which are reinterpreted as correlators of the celestial CFT in $D - 2$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein Telescope is the next-generation gravitational wave interferometer which, compared to current detectors, will enable the observation of gravitational signals at lower frequencies with a sensitivity improved by approximately two orders of magnitude. Achieving such exceptional sensitivity requires minimizing all sources of noise. In the low-frequency regime, magnetic noise is one of the dominant. This article examines the effectiveness and limitations of a passive mitigation technique: ferromagnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Parity-violating Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of parity-violating (PV) extensions of symmetric teleparallel gravity by applying this PV gravity theory to axion inflation. The presence of PV terms induces velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently, the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum, exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV gravity theory.</description>

      <title>The 300 TeV photon from GRB 221009A: a Hint at Non-linear Lorentz Invariance Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum correlations through information-theoretic measures is fundamental to developments in quantum field theory, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. A central feature in a plethora of systems is the area law, under which information scales with the size of the boundary of the system, rather than volume. Whilst many systems and regimes exhibiting an area law have been identified theoretically, experimental verification remains limited, particularly in continuous systems. We present a methodology for measuring mutual information in an experimental simulator of non-interacting quantum fields, and propose using the analogue $(2 + 1)$-dimensional spacetime offered by thin films of superfluid helium. We provide numerical predictions incorporating the natural thermal state of the helium sample that exemplify an area-law scaling of mutual information, and characterise deviations attributable to the inherent finite system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Preheating and gravitational waves in large-field hilltop inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined Planck, BICEP/Keck Array and BAO measurements of the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the cosmic microwave background observations severely constrain or completely rule out several models of inflationary potentials. On the other hand, the data seems to favor concave potentials over convex ones. In this paper, we study preheating and gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton, $\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\chi$, through a quartic coupling. After inflation ends, $\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a lattice simulation. The lattice simulations demonstrate that, although the initial inhomogeneities generate a stochastic gravitational wave background that remains below the present observational limit, the fluctuations do not grow exponentially, and the occupation numbers of $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$ remain close to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the special extremal slice inside an AdS black hole is dual to an absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. We demonstrate this by confirming the $n$-independence of holographic $n$-th Renyi entropies for any bi-partite subsystems. Our result gives an AME state in an infinite-volume system, where the local bond dimension is set by the black hole entropy. In particular, our construction provides concrete support from the gravity side for the emergence of random structures and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in recent non-isometric holographic codes.</description>

      <title>Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.</description>

      <title>Information Transport in Classic-Quantum Hybrid System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing gravity beyond general relativity with bispectrum multipoles of cosmological tracers: I. Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bispectrum, being sensitive to non-Gaussianity and mode coupling of cosmological fields induced by non-linear gravitational evolution, serves as a powerful probe for detecting deviations from General Relativity (GR). The signatures of modified gravity in the bispectrum are even more pronounced in redshift space, where anisotropies from peculiar velocities provide unbiased information on higher-order properties of gravity. We investigate the potential of all non-zero angular multipoles $B_l^m$ of redshift space bispectrum across all possible triangle configurations to probe degenerate higher-order scalar tensor (DHOST) theory. We show that the higher-order multipoles of the bispectrum with $l=2,4,6$ are more sensitive to the modifications in gravity than the spherically averaged monopole moment $l=0$. These multipoles demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to the higher-order growth history, which varies across triangle configurations, with acute triangles generally being the most sensitive to modification in GR. The values of various multipoles exhibit opposite signs in modified gravity compared to those predicted in GR, which serves as a robust indicator of the deviation from GR. We demonstrate that, unlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\leq 4$ are not affected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters, emphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses. The $(l=6, m &gt; 4)$ multipoles fail to capture the second-order growth, while all $l=8$ multipoles lack any independent information regarding modified gravity in both linear and nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Parametrizing the Hubble function instead of dark energy: Many possibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we propose a very simple parametrization of the Hubble function without parametrizing the dark components of the Universe. One of the novelties of the parametrization is that it may include a wide variety of the cosmological models, such as dark energy (both noninteracting and interacting fluids), modified gravity, cosmological matter creation and other known scenarios. The model is constrained with the latest astronomical probes from Hubble parameter measurements, three distinct versions of Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+, DESY5, Union3) and baryon acoustic oscillations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data releases 1 and 2. Our results suggest a mild deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for most of the combined datasets. We also find that our model is thermodynamically consistent and performs well in the model comparison tests.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Strongly Magnetized Eccentric Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations indicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the range of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields as high as $ \sim 10^{17-18}\,\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable magnetic fields, $10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For extreme fields of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be sensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO is limited to galactic distances: $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\sim 100\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}\,\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable at Gpc distances. In highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon. These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories may be capable of identifying magnetized binary systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Horizon Collisions around Near-Extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes have sometimes been described as astrophysical particle accelerators because finite energy particles can collide near the horizon with divergent center-of-mass (CM) energy. The collisions are classified by the radial motion of the constituent particles at the moment of collision, with each class exhibiting a distinct near-horizon behavior. Divergence in the CM energy is sourced by the difference in the rate at which the collision radius approaches the horizon and the rate at which a particle's angular momentum is tuned to a critical value set by the superradiant bound. To produce a high energy collision around a near-extremal BH, at least one particle must approach criticality slower than the collision radius approaches the horizon. When both particles are ingoing or outgoing, it is additionally required that the particles approach criticality at different rates. Using a novel multi-scaling limit, we calculate the explicit form for the divergent CM energy. The angular momentum of some circular orbiters -- including those at the innermost stable circular orbit radius and innermost bound circular orbit radius -- approach criticality as the BH approaches extremality, indicating near-extremal BHs may be a natural environment for these high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Regularity and temperature of stationary black hole event horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Available proofs of the regularity of stationary black hole event horizons rely on certain assumptions on the existence of sections that imply a $C^1$ differentiability assumption. By using a quotient bundle approach, we remedy this problem by proving directly that, indeed, under the null energy condition event horizons of stationary black holes are totally geodesic null hypersurfaces as regular as the metric. Only later, by using this result, we show that the cross-sections, whose existence was postulated in previous works, indeed exist.These results hold true under weak causality conditions. Subsequently, we prove that under the dominant energy condition stationary black hole event horizons indeed admit constant surface gravity, a result that does not require any non-degeneracy assumption, requirements on existence of cross-sections or a priori smoothness conditions. We are able to make sense of the angular velocity and of the value (not just sign) of surface gravity as quantities related to the horizon, without the need of assuming Einstein's vacuum equations and the Killing extension. Physically, this implies that under very general conditions every stationary black hole has indeed a constant temperature (the zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics).</description>

Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping compact-binary-coalescence signals. For the first time, in order to aid rapid and robust estimation, we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events. This framework is highly extensible, allowing analytical calculation for more complicated scenarios, such as multi-signal overlaps, overlaps between different types of sources, and source-dependent thresholds. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from highly deformed compact objects with DECIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for continuous gravitational waves from isolated compact objects and those in binary systems aim to detect non-axisymmetric, deformed neutron stars at particular locations in the Galaxy or all-sky. However, a large fraction of known pulsars have rotational frequencies that lie outside the audio frequency band, rendering current detectors insensitive to these pulsars. In this work, we show that DECIGO, a future space-based deci-hertz gravitational-wave interferometer, will be sensitive to severely deformed compact objects, e.g. hybrid stars, neutron stars, or magnetars. We estimate the number of possible compact objects that could be detected with such high deformations, both via their individual continuous gravitational-wave emission and the stochastic gravitational-wave background created by a superposition of gravitational waves from the $\sim 10^8$ compact objects in the Galaxy. Furthermore, we show that the existence of such compact objects could be probed across a wide parameter space at a fraction of the computational cost of current searches for isolated compact objects and those in binary systems. For known pulsars, we will be able to both beat the spin-down limit and probe the Brans-Dicke modified theory of gravity parameter $\zeta&lt;1$ for approximately 85% of known pulsars with $f_{\rm gw}&lt;10$ Hz, the latter of which is currently only possible for $O(10)$ pulsars. DECIGO will thus open a new window to probe highly deformed compact objects and over half of the known pulsars, both of which are currently inaccessible to ground-based detectors.</description>

Abstract: A regular black hole, unconstrained by the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, can exceed its critical spin limit and transition into a superspinar. In this paper, we investigate the observational appearance of a rotating regular black hole, specifically the Ghosh black hole and its superspinar counterpart, when surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal distinct features: the black hole closely resembles its Kerr counterpart with slight deviations, while the superspinar configuration exhibits an inner photon ring structure. Furthermore, we explore the image transition of the Ghosh black hole that has been recently destroyed by the capture of a test particle. The results show that the inner photon ring undergoes gradual transitions over time, and these transition times are largely insensitive to the additional angular momentum acquired by the black hole. Our findings also suggest that the transition timescale becomes relevant for supermassive black holes with masses approximately twice that of M87*, making these effects potentially observable with future high-resolution instruments.</description>

Abstract: A candidate for relativistic MOND with successful cosmology was proposed recently by using a Lorentz-violating vector field in Einstein's gravity. We show that the dynamic nature of the vector field makes it challenging to realize the MOND. Only in the stationary limit, thus excluding cosmological situations, one can achieve the MOND limit. We study the evolution of density perturbations in the baryon-vector field system using both post-Newtonian approximation and relativistic perturbation theory. Our results show that, considering the dynamic nature of the vector field, the faster growth of structures expected in the low-acceleration MOND regime is not recovered in the relativistic MOND.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring quasinormal modes (QNMs) during the ringdown phase of binary black hole coalescences provides key insights into merger dynamics and enables tests of the no-hair theorem. The QNM rational filter has recently been introduced as a technique to identify specific QNMs in ringdown signals without sampling over mode amplitudes and phases. In this work, we extend the QNM rational filter framework to quantify the statistical confidence of subdominant mode detections in real gravitational wave (GW) observations. We employ a frequentist approach to estimate false-alarm probabilities and propose a workflow for robust identification of specific QNMs. We first validate our methodology using synthetic signals generated from numerical relativity waveforms. We then reanalyze the first GW event, GW150914, finding a marginal detection of an overtone, but at time when the applicability of constant amplitude QNM fits is not fully understood. This extended methodology provides a systematic approach to improving the reliability of QNM detections, paving the way for more precise tests of strong-field gravity with current and future GW observations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum effective dynamics of Papapetrou spacetime by using methods from loop quantum gravity. The Papapetrou spacetime is an extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with an extra coupled anti-scalar field. By solving the equations of motion generated by the Hamiltonian constraint for Papapetrou spacetime, we can construct the quantum effective metric. The resulting effective metric for the quantum-corrected Papapetrou spacetime demonstrates the quantum effects will give rise to a new wormhole throat, while the classical wormhole throat disappear in the case of extremely small mass.</description>

      <title>Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>Extending unified gravity to account for graviton-graviton interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] has been developed to extend the Standard Model to include gravity. Here we present unified gravity using the ordinary four-vector and tensor field notation of the Standard Model. The main goal of the present work is to extend the original Minkowski spacetime formulation of the theory to account for graviton-graviton interaction. This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.</description>

      <title>Potential science with GW250114 -- the loudest binary black hole merger detected to date</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On January 14, 2025 the LIGO interferometers detected a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, GW250114. Using publicly available information, we estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of GW250114 was $\sim 80$. This would make it three to four times louder than any other gravitational wave detected to date. GW250114 therefore offers a unique opportunity to make precise measurements of its source parameters and to test general relativity. In anticipation of its public data release, we analyze a set of simulated signals that have parameters similar to what we estimate for GW250114 and explore what new insights may be gained from this significant event. We investigate how well the component spins may be constrained, whether any eccentricity may be measured, what quasi-normal modes (QNMs) may be detected in the post-merger signal, how well the black hole area theorem may be constrained, and what constraints may be expected on sub-dominant inspiral-merger-ringdown modes. We find that it should be possible to measure a non-zero eccentricity at $20\,$Hz ($e_{20}$) if GW250114 has $e_{20} \gtrsim 0.05$. We also find that at least one overtone of the dominant QNM should be detectable in the ringdown of GW250114, with a Bayes factor of $O(10^3)$ after marginalizing over all timing uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at the past timelike boundary point for spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = t^{\alpha}$, and spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = a_0 t^{\alpha}$. We employ the spacetime inextendibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce their inextendibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there exists at least one critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the VDR asymptote along the $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic equals the Minkowski value.</description>

      <title>Classifying the unknown: discovering novel gravitational-wave detector glitches using similarity learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.04058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences by LIGO and Virgo has begun a new era in astronomy. A critical challenge in making detections is determining whether loud transient features in the data are caused by gravitational waves or by instrumental or environmental sources. The citizen-science project Gravity Spy has been demonstrated as an efficient infrastructure for classifying known types of noise transients (glitches) through a combination of data analysis performed by both citizen volunteers and machine learning. We present the next iteration of this project, using similarity indices to empower citizen scientists to create large data sets of unknown transients, which can then be used to facilitate supervised machine-learning characterization. This new evolution aims to alleviate a persistent challenge that plagues both citizen-science and instrumental detector work: the ability to build large samples of relatively rare events. Using two families of transient noise that appeared unexpectedly during LIGO's second observing run (O2), we demonstrate the impact that the similarity indices could have had on finding these new glitch types in the Gravity Spy program.</description>

      <title>Inverted Oscillators for Testing Gravity-induced Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the quest for quantum gravity, we have lacked experimental verification, hampered by the weakness of gravity and decoherence. Recently, various experiments have been proposed to verify quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravitational interactions. However, they are not yet certainly feasible with existing techniques. To search for a new setup, we compute the logarithmic negativity of two oscillators with arbitrary quadratic potential coupled by gravity. We find that unstable inverted oscillators generate gravity-induced entanglement most quickly and are most resistant to decoherence from environmental fluctuations. As an experimental realization, we propose a setup of the optical levitation of mirrors with the anti-spring effect. To avoid decoherence due to photon shot noise, a sandwich configuration that geometrically creates the anti-spring is promising.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. Different classes of FRBs require different physical mechanisms. If some empirical relations are found for different classes of FRBs, they might justify the classifications scenario and help us to reveal the physical mechanisms behind. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe for cosmology, since their redshifts could be $z\sim 3$ or even higher. Similar to the cosmology of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some empirical relations might also play an important role in the FRB cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were proposed recently. In particular, it was suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young stellar populations, and some empirical relations have also been found for them, respectively. One of these empirical relations (namely $L_\nu-E$ relation) without dispersion measure (DM) has been used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. So, it is of interest to check the empirical relations with the actual data of current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm. This is beneficial to the FRB cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymptote to the Bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This stress tensor, the null Brown-York tensor, yields a Carrollian stress tensor at null infinity from the bulk. Furthermore, we establish that the canonical phase space on finite-distance null hypersurfaces asymptotes to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of a charged scalar field against a charged black hole background, leading to an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at small but finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy within the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, new superparticle models have been proposed in the $\mathcal{N}$-extended four and five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces, AdS$^{4|4\mathcal{N}}$ and AdS$^{5|8\mathcal{N}}$, making use of a unique quadratic deformation to the AdS supersymmetric interval. In this paper we extend these considerations to the three and two-dimensional cases, and propose new two-derivative models for superparticles propagating in these AdS superspaces.</description>

      <title>New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \&amp; ACT \&amp; SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \&amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</description>

Abstract: A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim T_0\sim 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ black holes with primary Proca hair from regularized Gauss-Bonnet coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge. As special cases, we find a regular black hole solution in addition to charged and uncharged stealth BTZ black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>
