      <title>Weighted Birkhoff Averages Accelerate Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Ni\~no data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</description>

      <title>Relative topological entropy and relative mean dimension of induced factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation of relative topological entropy and relative mean dimension between a factor map and its induced factor map for amenable group actions. On the one hand, we prove that a factor map has zero relative topological entropy if and only if so does the induced factor map. On the other hand, we prove that a factor map has positive relative topological entropy if and only if the induced factor map has infinite relative mean dimension.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov-Based Distri buted Framework for Complete and Phase Synchronization in Chaotic Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed Lyapunov-based control framework for achieving both complete and phase synchronization in a class of leader-follower multi-agent systems composed of identical chaotic agents. The proposed approach introduces a novel nonlinear coupling mechanism and utilizes Lyapunov stability theory combined with matrix measure analysis to derive explicit synchronization conditions. In contrast to traditional LMI-based or adaptive methods, the present approach guarantees synchronization under limited topological information and reduced computational complexity. Three classical chaotic systems - Roessler, Lu, and Chen - are used to validate the theoretical results, confirming the superior convergence rate and robustness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of inertial manifolds for stochastic differential equations driven by non-Gaussian Levy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the limiting behavior for stochastic differential equations driven by non-Gaussian alpha-stable Levy noise as alpha approaches 2. We first prove the convergence of solutions for system driven by alpha-stable Levy noise to those of the system driven by Brownian motion. Then we construct the C^1 inertial manifolds for both systems and show that these inertial manifolds converge in probability as alpha rightarrow2.</description>

      <title>Physical measures for asymptotically sectional expanding flows in higher co-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of physical/SRB measures for asymptotically sectionally hyperbolic attracting sets with any finite co-dimension, extending the co-dimension two case.
  We provide examples of such attractors, either with non-sectional hyperbolic equilibria, or with sectional-hyperbolic equilibria of mixed type, i.e., with a Lorenz-like singularity together with a Rovella-like singularity in a transitive set. These are higher-dimensional versions of contracting Lorenz-like attractors (also known as Rovella-like attractors) to which we apply our criteria to obtain a physical/SRB measure with full ergodic basin.
  We also adapt the previous examples to obtain higher co-dimensional non-uniformly sectional expanding attractors; and also asymptotical $p$-sectional hyperbolic attractors which are \emph{not} non-uniformly $(p-1)$-expanding, for any finite $p&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy, topological pressure and variational principle for locally compact sofic group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally compact sofic group continuously acting on a compact metric space, we first study the relative sofic entropy and prove an additive inequality relating sofic entropy and relative sofic entropy. Moreover, it is shown that the relative variational principle remains valid in this paper. Secondly, the topological pressure for locally compact sofic group actions is investigated and the variational principle for topological pressure in this sofic context is established. As an application, we show a sufficient condition for a signed measure to be a $G$-invariant measure. These contributions generalize the classical results for countable sofic groups on such spaces.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of random products of weighted shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study the dynamics of random products of weighted shifts on a separable Fr\'echet sequence space. That is, given a Polish measure-preserving dynamical system $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu, \tau)$ equipped with its Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ and a Borel probability measure $\mu$, a Fr\'echet sequence space $X$ with a basis $(e_n)_{n \geq 0}$, and a strongly measurable map $T : \Omega \to \mathcal{B}(X)$ taking values in a finite set of weighted shifts on $X$, we study the dynamics of the sequence $(T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega))_{n \geq 1}$ for almost every $\omega \in \Omega$. After proving criteria to determine whether this sequence is universal, weakly mixing or mixing for almost every $\omega \in \Omega$, we study some examples on the spaces $X = \ell_p$, $X = c_0$ and $X = H(\mathbb{C})$ involving two shifts, first in the commuting case and then in the non-commuting one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of chaotic trajectories for the two body problem on a sphere. The trajectories we construct encounter near-collisions and are similar to the second species solutions of Poincar\'e of the classical 3 body problem. The construction uses a general result on Lagrangian systems with Newtonian singularities of the potential which is based on the method of anti-integrable limit of Serge Aubry.</description>

      <title>Another billiard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold, $\Omega\subset M$ a domain with boundary $\Gamma$, and $\phi$ a smooth function such that $\phi|_\Omega &gt; 0$, $\ph|_\Gamma = 0$, and $\nabla\phi|_\Gamma\ne 0$. We study the geodesic flow of the metric $G=g/\phi$. The $G$-distance from any point of $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$ is finite, hence the geodesic flow is incomplete. Regularization of the flow in a neighborhood of $\Gamma$ establishes a natural reflection law from $\Gamma$. This leads to a certain billiard problem in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>A note on two Collatz evolution flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two evolution models based on the generalized Collatz operator are introduced. These models are characterized by coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the Collatz dynamics, and are suitably defined. Here, $\alpha=\beta=1$, and $\alpha=3$, $\beta=1$ correspond to the Nollatz and classical Collatz operators, respectively. In general, the first evolution model is a continuum, Fourier side based, motivated by the Cubic Szeg\H{o} operator of G\'erard and Grellier. The second evolution considers discrete time derivatives of the Collatz orbits. In this paper we describe the evolution of both models, with particular emphasis on dynamical properties. For the first one, it is proved local and global existence in the space $L^2(\mathbb T)$, and a one-to-one characterization of the existence of nontrivial periodic and unbounded orbits of the Collatz mapping in terms of particular set of solutions of this continuous Collatz flow. For the discrete part, a sort of discrete energy is introduced. This energy has the property of being conserved by the discrete flow. An estimate of each term in this energy is given, proving suitable growth bounds. Finally, the meaning of the discrete time derivative for the generalized Collatz orbits is discussed. It is proved that, except for the Nollatz and Collatz operators, the sum of coefficients related to this discrete time derivative is an increasing sequence in $n$ as the iteration parameter $n$ evolves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining functional phenotypes despite genetic and environmental perturbations. Discrete dynamical models, such as Boolean networks, provide systems biologists with a tractable framework to explore the mathematical underpinnings of this robustness. A key mechanism conferring stability is canalization. This perspective synthesizes historical insights, formal definitions of canalization in discrete dynamical models, quantitative measures of stability, illustrative applications, and emerging challenges at the interface of theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>SEIR models with host heterogeneity: theoretical aspects and applications to seasonal influenza dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population heterogeneity is a key factor in epidemic dynamics, influencing both transmission and final epidemic size. While heterogeneity is often modeled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR-models, which are widely used for influenza and other respiratory infections. We derive the model equations under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness. Analytical results show that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $\Ro$. In the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility, we obtain stronger results on the epidemic final size. The resulting model captures population heterogeneity through a single parameter, which makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by applying it to seasonal influenza in Italy.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Opinion Dynamics with Application to Vaccine Denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public health outcomes can be heavily influenced by the landscape of public opinion; hence, it is important to understand how that landscape changes over time. For one, opinions on public health issues are responsive to official pronouncements, whether from the governmental or professional medical establishments. Additionally, in today's world of high speed communication, opinion can also be highly responsive to the broadcast opinions of "influencers" whose large numbers of followers assure them of a broad reach. To understand the opinion landscape in a general sense, we develop an ordinary differential equation model for opinion change that is based primarily on attraction to the opinions of prominent sources. The individual opinion change model is then used to develop a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation model for the overall opinion landscape. This model is shown to have a stable equilibrium solution, and the dependence of the equilibrium solution on key model parameters is illustrated with examples based on opinion regarding vaccination.</description>

      <title>Explicit Bounds on the Hausdorff Distance for Truncated mRPI Sets via Norm-Dependent Contraction Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the first explicit and closed-form upper bound on the Hausdorff distance between the truncated minimal robust positively invariant (mRPI) set and its infinite-horizon limit. While existing mRPI approximations guarantee asymptotic convergence through geometric or norm-based arguments, none provides a computable expression that quantifies the truncation error for a given horizon. We show that the error satisfies \( d_H(\mathcal{E}_N,\mathcal{E}_\infty) \le r_W\,\gamma^{N+1}/(1-\gamma), \) where $\gamma&lt;1$ is the induced-norm contraction factor and $r_W$ depends only on the disturbance set. The bound is fully analytic, requires no iterative set computations, and directly characterizes the decay rate of the truncated Minkowski series. We further demonstrate that the choice of vector norm serves as a design parameter that accelerates convergence, enabling substantially tighter horizon selection for robust invariant-set computations and tube-based MPC. Numerical experiments validate the sharpness, scalability, and practical relevance of the proposed bound.</description>

      <title>The planar Lanchester model of insurgent warfare: Intricate Collateral Damage Functions and Global Bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most notable aspects of mathematical modeling is that it sheds light on the complexities arising from changes in parameters and their real-world implications, thus gaining better insight into the dynamics of economic, political, and security phenomena. Moreover, modifications to mathematical modeling will set the stage for embedding new features into the system and enriching the assessment of our analysis. In the case of the Lanchester model of warfare, the introduction of the collateral damage function was an attempt to turn the model into a more realistic framework for understanding counter-insurgencies and irregular battles. In this article, we focus on addressing the impact of sophisticated collateral damage functions in a modified Lanchester model of combat, which reflects the multifaceted nature of warfare. This analysis shows the possibility of global bifurcations and their repercussions for the combat situation between two players. Finally, we assess the codimension two bifurcation analysis of our system based on the interaction between collateral damage and the effectiveness of targeting insurgents.</description>

Abstract: We consider the continuum limit of some products of random matrices in $\text{SL}(d,{\mathbb R})$ that arise as discretisations of incompressible renewing flows -- that is, of flows corresponding to a divergence-free velocity field that takes independent, identically-distributed values in successive time intervals of duration proportional to $\tau$. The statistical properties of the product are encoded in its generalised Lyapunov exponent whose computation reduces to finding the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator. In the continuum (Kraichnan--Kazantsev) limit obtained by neglecting the terms of order $o(\tau^2)$, the transfer operator becomes a partial differential operator and, for a certain type of disorder which we call ``symmetric'', some calculations are feasible. For $d=2$, we compute the growth rate of the product in terms of complete elliptic integrals. By letting the elliptic modulus vary, we obtain a spectral problem, corresponding to a modulus-dependent random renewing flow, which may be viewed as a perturbation of the spectral problem for the angular Laplacian. In this way, we deduce expansions for the generalised Lyapunov exponent in ascending powers of the modulus. These expansions generalise to the case $d \ge 2$, and we compute the first few terms explicitly for $d \in \{2,3\}$.</description>

      <title>L\'evy noise drives an exponential acceleration in transition rates within metastable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: L\'evy noise influences diverse non-equilibrium systems across scales, including quantum devices, active biological matter, and financial markets. While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for L\'evy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that L\'evy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak L\'evy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties.</description>

      <title>A joint optimization approach to identifying sparse dynamics using least squares kernel collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an all-at-once modeling framework for learning systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from scarce, partial, and noisy observations of the states. The proposed methodology amounts to a combination of sparse recovery strategies for the ODE over a function library combined with techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory for estimating the state and discretizing the ODE. Our numerical experiments reveal that the proposed strategy leads to significant gains in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise, both in terms of learning the equation and estimating the unknown states. This work demonstrates capabilities well beyond existing and widely used algorithms while extending the modeling flexibility of other recent developments in equation discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper a forward-backward-forward dynamical system for solving a mixed variational inequality problem in a real Hilbert space. For the convergence analysis of our proposed system, we apply the Lyapunov analysis to obtain the weak convergence of the generated trajectories when the associated operator is Lipschitz continuous and satisfies the general monotonicity condition. We also assume that the involved real-valued convex function satisfies some mild assumptions. Furthermore, the Lipschitz continuous operator is taken to be $h-$strongly pseudomonotone to establish the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of the system for all the orbits generated. Finally, we present some numerical examples which illustrate how the trajectories of the proposed system converge to the equilibrium point of the proposed dynamical system.</description>

      <title>From discrete iteration in the unit disc to continuous semigroups of holomorphic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to bring together the theories of holomorphic iteration in the unit disc and semigroups of holomorphic functions. We develop a technique that allows us to partially embed the orbit of a holomorphic self-map $f$ of the disc, into a semigroup which captures the asymptotic behaviour of the orbit. This extends the semigroup-fication procedure introduced by Bracci and Roth to non-univalent functions. We use our technique in order to obtain sharp estimates for the rate with which the orbits of $f$ converge to the attracting fixed point; a fundamental, yet underdeveloped, concept in discrete iteration. Moreover, our semigroup-fication allows us to evaluate the slope of the orbits of $f$, and prove that they behave similarly to quasi-geodesic curves precisely when they converge non-tangentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider linear, time-dependent and skew-adjoint perturbations of periodic transport equations on the one-dimensional torus. We describe the long-time behavior of solutions for all non-degenerate perturbations in resonant regime, proving that either there exist solutions whose Sobolev norms explode exponentially fast, provoking energy transfer phenomena, or all solutions remain stable for arbitrarily long time scales. The proof combines pseudodifferential tools with dynamical systems results: we perform a resonant normal form procedure to reduce our analysis to the classical dynamics for the resonant equation. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the instability result, for which we explicitly construct an escape function associated to the dynamics. This is obtained by means of a positive commutator estimate on the operator associated with the escape function, exploiting microlocal analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of spectral stability of traveling wave solutions $u=\gamma(x-Wt)$ for a system of viscous conservation laws $\partial_t u + \partial_x F(u) = \partial^2_x u$. Such solutions correspond to heteroclinic trajectories $\gamma$ of a system of ODE. In general conditions of stability can be obtained only numerically. We propose a model class of piece-wise linear (discontinuous) vector fields $F$ for which the stability problem is reduced to a linear algebra problem. We show that the stability problem makes sense in such low regularity and construct several examples of stability loss. Every such example can be smoothed to provide a smooth example of the same phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Disc Game Dynamics: A Latent Space Perspective on Selection and Learning in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory studies populations that change in response to an underlying game. Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincar\'e recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that the Cuntz--Pimsner algebras associated to minimal homeomorphisms twisted by line bundles, along with their orbit-breaking subalgebras, are $\mathcal{Z}$-stable whenever the underlying dynamical system has the small boundary property. This entails that this class is classified by the Elliott invariant. Furthermore, we show that the tensor product of two such $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras is always $\mathcal{Z}$-stable, without assuming the small boundary property. In particular this applies to $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras arising from systems with positive mean dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes several sharp spectral results for analytic quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators. Key contributions include: (1) exact exponential decay rates for spectral gaps of the almost Mathieu operator, addressing a question raised by Goldstein; (2) sharp arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic operators on higher-dimensional lattices, which in particular resolves and generalizes Jitomirskaya's phase transition conjecture; and (3) stratified growth patterns for extended eigenfunctions revealing universal partial hierarchical structures for subcritical quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators.
  The proofs are based on novel frameworks-structured quantitative almost reducibility and sharp quantitative duality-to overcome the longstanding challenge of taming infinitely many rotation-number resonances, which enables us to obtain optimal arithmetic reducibility results for analytic SL(2,R)-cocycles, thereby solving another Jitomirskaya's conjecture. These methods enable a first comprehensive treatment of resonance-driven dynamical asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of pullback attractors in recurrent neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks trained via the reservoir computing paradigm have demonstrated remarkable success in learning and reconstructing attractors from chaotic systems, often replicating quantities such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions. It has recently been conjectured that this is because the reservoir computer embeds the dynamics of the chaotic system in its state space before learning. This conjecture has been established for reservoir computers with linear activation functions and remains open for more general reservoir systems. In this work, we employ a non-autonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the box-counting dimension of the pullback attractor, a subset of the reservoir state space that is approximated during training and prediction phases. We prove that the box-counting dimension of the pullback attractor is bounded above by the box-counting dimension of the space of input sequences with respect to the product topology. In particular, for input sequences originating from an Nin-dimensional smooth dynamical system or their generic continuously differentiable observations, the box-counting dimension of the pullback attractor is bounded above by Nin. The results obtained here highlight the fact that, while a reservoir computer may possess a very high-dimensional state space, it exhibits effective low-dimensional dynamics. Our findings also partly explain why reservoir computers are successful in tasks such as attractor reconstruction and the computation of dynamic invariants like Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis of an HIV infection model with latent reservoir, immune impairment and delayed CTL immune response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of HIV infection that incorporates latent hosts, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity, saturated incidence rates, and two transmission mechanisms: virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell transmission. The model has three kinds of delays: intracellular delay, replication of viruses delay, immune response delay. Initially, the model's solutions are confirmed to be both nonnegative and bounded for nonnegative initial values. Subsequently, two biologically critical parameters were identified: the virus reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the immune reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_1$. Thereafter, by invoking LaSalle's principle of invariance alongside Lyapunov functionals, we establish stability criteria for each equilibrium. The results indicate that the stability of the endemic equilibrium may be altered by a positive immune delay, whereas intracellular and viral replication delays do not affect the equilibria. By considering the delay in the immune response as a bifurcation-inducing threshold, we derive the exact conditions necessary for these stability transitions. Further analysis shows that increasing the immune delay destabilizes the endemic equilibrium, inducing a Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, using the center manifold theorem and normal form theory, we explored the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcations in detail. To corroborate these theoretical results, numerical simulations are systematically conducted.</description>

Abstract: A simple criterion of the existence of (type-I) blow-up solutions for nonautonomous ODEs is provided. In a previous study [Matsue, SIADS, 24(2025), 415-456], geometric criteria for characterizing blow-up solutions for nonautonomous ODEs are provided by means of dynamics at infinity. The basic idea towards the present aim is to correspond such criteria to leading-term equations associated with blow-up ansatz characterizing multiple-order asymptotic expansions, which originated from the corresponding study developed in the framework of autonomous ODEs. Restricting our attention to constant coefficients of leading terms of blow-ups, results involving the simple criterion of blow-up characterizations in autonomous ODEs can be mimicked to nonautonomous ODEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove power Fourier decay for equilibrium states of nonlinear $C^{1+\alpha}$ iterated function systems, giving first examples of truly $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs with attractors of positive Fourier dimension that are not conjugated to a linear IFS previously out of reach of existing techniques. The key new ingredient is a Measure Non-Linearity (MNL) criterion tailored to $C^{1+\alpha}$ IFSs, coupling oscillations in geometric and symbolic directions and allowing us to prove the necessary multiscale non-linearity condition for Fourier decay via an induction-on-scales scheme. This bypasses the classical obstructions that require either large dimension enabling stationary phase comparisons (Kaufman measures), or smoothness or cohomological conditions on the roof function $\tau$ such as $\tau \in C^1$ (Dolgopyat's method), $\tau \in C^\alpha$ but with smooth underlying dynamics (Tsujii--Zhang strategy), or non-flat $C^\alpha$ conjugacy to a constant (fractal van der Corput lemma). The method also applies to parabolic systems including limit sets of geometrically finite groups, Manneville-Pommeau maps, and Lorenz-type maps.</description>

Abstract: Developing methods for detecting tipping phenomena at an early stage is an important problem in various fields such as ecology, medicine, and economics. A tipping phenomenon is characterized by a rapid transition resulting from the accumulation of small parameter changes and is known to be related to bifurcations of dynamical systems. However, few studies have examined how nonlinear properties near bifurcation points affect early warning signal (EWS) performance. In this study, we apply the Koopman operator, which describes the time evolution of dynamical systems in an infinite-dimensional function space, to generalize stochastic resilience the theoretical basis of EWSs such as variance-based ones. As a result, we develop a novel signal capable of more accurately predicting tipping events by separately isolating stochastic fluctuations induced by noise and contributions from a continuous spectrum emerging immediately above tipping points. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach detects early signs of tipping phenomena more robustly than conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of three, about (relatively)free profinite semigroups and S-adic representations of minimal
  shift spaces. We associate to each primitive S-adic directivesequence ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ a $\textit{profinite image}$ in the free profinite
  semigroup over the alphabet of the induced minimal shift space. When this profinite image contains a $\mathcal{J}$-maximal maximal subgroup
  of the free profinite semigroup (which, up to isomorphism, is called the $\textit{Sch\"utzenberger group}$ of the shift space), we say that
  ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is $\textit{saturating}$. We show that if ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is recognizable, then it is saturating. Conversely, we use the notion
  of saturating sequence to obtain several sufficient conditions for ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ to be recognizable: ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ consists of pure encodings;
  or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, saturating and consists of encodings; or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, recurrent,
  bounded and consists of encodings. For the most part, we do not assume that ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ has finite alphabet rank although we establish
  that this combinatorial property has important algebraic consequences, namely that the rank of the Sch\"utzenberger group is
  also finite, whose maximum possible value we also determine. We also show that for every minimal shift space of finite topological rank,
  the rank of its Sch\"utzenberger group is a lower bound of the topological rank.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Parameter $\alpha$ in the Simplified Bardina Model through Continuous Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a continuous data assimilation algorithm to recover the parameter $\alpha$ in the simplified Bardina model. Our method utilizes the observations of finitely many Fourier modes by using a nudging framework that involves recursive parameter updates. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that the approximate parameter approaches the true value under suitable conditions, while the approximate solution also converges to the true solution.</description>

      <title>Universal Averaging for Ergodic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies homothetic and more general weighted averages for flows. Absolutely continuous convolutions of singular weights are considered, thereby strengthening Kozlov-Treshchev's result on nonuniform averages for ergodic flows. The concept of almost mixing, formulated in terms of weighted average convergences, is proposed. An example of a non-mixing almost mixing flow is given. It is proven that rigid flows do not have the property of almost mixing.</description>

      <title>Normal distribution of Lyapunov exponents of periodic orbits for expanding circle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth expanding circle map, we show that the empirical distribution of Lyapunov exponents of periodic points of any fixed period is close to normal, with an error that decreases as the period grows. This establishes a version of the Central Limit Theorem for such finite periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a functional-analytic framework for approximating the push-forward induced by an analytic map from finitely many samples. Instead of working directly with the map, we study the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals and identify it, via the Fourier--Borel transform, with an operator on the space of entire functions of exponential type. This yields finite-dimensional approximations of the push-forward together with explicit error bounds expressed in terms of the smallest eigenvalues of certain Hankel moment matrices. Moreover, we obtain sample complexity bounds for the approximation from i.i.d.~sampled data. As a consequence, we show that linear algebraic operations on the finite-dimensional approximations can be used to reconstruct analytic vector fields from discrete trajectory data. In particular, we prove convergence of a data-driven method for recovering the vector field of an ordinary differential equation from finite-time flow map data under fairly general conditions.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <title>Rotation sets and axes in the fine curve graph for torus homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the dictionary between the action of a torus homeomorphism on the fine curve graph and its rotation set. More precisely, we show that the fixed points at infinity of a loxodromic element determine the rotation set up to scale. A key ingredient is a metric version of the classical WPD property from geometric group theory.
  As a consequence we find new stable criteria for positive scl, and for two homeomorphisms to generate a free group, and we provide a Tits alternative for groups of torus homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of Markov shifts: part II-LLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Local Central Limit Theorems (LLT) for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is a Markov chains with equicontinuous conditional probabilities satisfying contraction conditions close in spirit to Dobrushin's, and some ``physicality" assumptions and $f_j$ are equicontinuous functions. Our conditions will always be in force when the chain takes values on a metric space and have uniformly bounded away from $0$ backward transition densities with respect to a measure which assigns uniform positive mass to certain ``balls".
  This paper complements \cite{MarShif1} where Berry-Esseen theorems, were proven for (not necessarily continuous) functions satisfying certain approximation conditions. Our results address a question posed by D. Dolgopyat and O. Sarig in \cite[Section 1.5]{DS}.</description>
