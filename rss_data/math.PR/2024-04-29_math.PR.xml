      <title>A stochastic model for immune response with mutations and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two simple stochastic models for a pathogen population in the presence of an immune response, where we assume that the immune system must first get rid of the pathogen type with the lowest fitness in each ancestral lineage of pathogen types present in the host. In the first model, the pathogens reproduce independently at rate $\lambda$ without spatial restrictions. The second model is similar but evolves on a graph. In this case, each pathogen occupies a site and can only place offspring on adjacent empty sites. In both models, when a new pathogen is born, it has the same type as its parent with probability $1-r$. Conversely, with probability $r$, a beneficial mutation occurs, generating a new pathogen type with a higher fitness than its parent's type. We assume that the immune system develops an effective immune response, independently at rate 1, for each pathogen type without ancestral types that are still alive, which simultaneously kills all pathogens of that type. Our main results are a complete characterization of the survival-extinction phase diagram of the first model, and sufficient conditions for survival and extinction of the second model on $\mathbb{Z}^d.$ A comparison with similar models introduced by Schinazi and Schweinsberg (2008), where mutations are not necessarily beneficial and the immune response for each pathogen type occurs independently at rate 1, reveals that the first and second models exhibit more complex and comparable behaviors, respectively.</description>

      <title>Branching random walk and log-slowly varying tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a branching random walk with independent and identically distributed, heavy tailed displacements. The offspring law is supercritical and satisfies the Kesten-Stigum condition. We treat the case when the law of the displacements does not lie in the max-domain of attraction of an extreme value distribution. Hence, the classical extreme value theory, which is often deployed in this kind of models, breaks down. We show that if the tails of the displacements are such that the absolute value of the logarithm of the tail is a slowly varying function, one can still effectively analyse the extremes of the process. More precisely, after a non-linear transformation the extremes of the branching random walk process converge to a cluster Cox process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider the decay property of stopped $M^X/M/1$-queueing networks with $d (\geq 2)$ nodes. The exact value of the decay parameter $\lambda_{\mathcal{C}}$ is obtained by using a new method. Then, the corresponding $\lambda_{\mathcal{C}}$-invariant measures and quasi-distributions are presented.</description>

      <title>Empirical approximation to invariant measures of mean-field Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the approximation to invariant measures for Langevin dynamics of McKean--Vlasov type. Under dissipativity and Lipschitz conditions, we prove that the empirical measures of both the mean-field and self-interacting Langevin dynamics converge to the invariant measure in the Wasserstein distance. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Uniform in time bounds for a stochastic hybrid system with fast periodic sampling and small white-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior, uniform-in-time, of a nonlinear dynamical system under the combined effects of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small white noise of size $\varepsilon,\thinspace 0&lt;\varepsilon,\delta \ll 1$. The dynamics depend on both the current and recent measurements of the state, and as such it is not Markovian. Our main results can be interpreted as Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type results. LLN type result shows that the resulting stochastic process is close to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) uniformly in time as $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0.$ Further, in regards to CLT, we provide quantitative and uniform-in-time control of the fluctuations process. The interaction of the small parameters provides an additional drift term in the limiting fluctuations, which captures both the sampling and noise effects. As a consequence, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process along with time-independent estimates on the remainder. The zeroth- and first-order terms in the expansion are given by an ODE and SDE, respectively. Simulation studies that illustrate and supplement the theoretical results are also provided.</description>

      <title>The $\ell_r$-Levy-Grothendieck problem and $r\rightarrow p$ norms of Levy matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $n\times n$ matrix $A_n$ and $1\leq r, p \leq\infty$, consider the following quadratic optimization problem referred to as the $\ell_r$-Grothendieck problem: \begin{align}M_r(A_n)\coloneqq\max_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n:\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_r\leq1}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top} A_n \boldsymbol{x},\end{align} as well as the $r\rightarrow p$ operator norm of the matrix $A_n$, defined as \begin{align}\|A_n\|_{r \rightarrow p}\coloneqq \sup _{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n:\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_r \leq 1}\|A_n \boldsymbol{x}\|_p,\end{align} where $\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_r$ denotes the $\ell_r$-norm of the vector $\boldsymbol{x}$. This work analyzes high-dimensional asymptotics of these quantities when $A_n$ are symmetric random matrices with independent and identically distributed heavy-tailed upper-triangular entries with index $\alpha$. When $1\leq r\leq 2$ (respectively, $1\leq r\leq p$) and $\alpha\in(0,2)$, suitably scaled versions of $M_r(A_n)$ and $\|A_n\|_{r\rightarrow p}$ are shown to converge to a Fr\'echet distribution as $n\rightarrow\infty$. In contrast, when $2&lt; r&lt;\infty$ (respectively, $1\leq p&lt; r$), it is shown that there exists $\alpha_*\in(1,2)$ such that for every $\alpha\in(0,\alpha_*)$, suitably scaled versions of $M_r(A_n)$ and $\|A_n\|_{r\rightarrow p}$ converge to the power of a stable distribution. Furthermore, it is shown that there exists $\bar\alpha_*&gt;\alpha_*$ such that when $\alpha\in(\alpha_*,\bar\alpha_*)$, the latter convergence result holds only when the matrix entries are centered; when the entries have non-zero mean, a different limit arises after additional centering and scaling. As a corollary, these results yield a characterization of the limiting ground state of the Levy spin glass when $\alpha \in (0,1)$. The analysis uses a combination of tools from the theory of heavy-tailed distributions, the nonlinear power method and concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Interface motion from Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics of non-gradient type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on a $d$-dimensional periodic lattice of size $N$, that is, a stochastic time evolution of particles performing random walks with interaction subject to the exclusion rule (Kawasaki part), in general, of non-gradient type, together with the effect of the creation and annihilation of particles (Glauber part) whose rates are set to favor two levels of particle density, called sparse and dense. We then study the limit of our dynamics under the hydrodynamic space-time scaling, that is, $1/N$ in space and a diffusive scaling $N^2$ for the Kawasaki part and another scaling $K=K(N)$, which diverges slower, for the Glauber part in time. In the limit as $N\to\infty$, we show that the particles autonomously make phase separation into sparse or dense phases at the microscopic level, and an interface separating two regions is formed at the macroscopic level and evolves under an anisotropic curvature flow.
  In the present article, we show that the particle density at the macroscopic level is well approximated by a solution of a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear diffusion term of divergence form and a large reaction term. Furthermore, by applying the results of Funaki, Gu and Wang [arXiv:2404.12234] for the convergence rate of the diffusion matrix approximated by local functions, we obtain a quantitative hydrodynamic limit as well as the upper bound for the allowed diverging speed of $K=K(N)$.
  The above result for the derivation of the interface motion is proved by combining our result with that in a companion paper by Funaki and Park [arXiv:2403.01732], in which we analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reaction-diffusion equation obtained in the present article and derived an anisotropic curvature flow in the situation where the macroscopic reaction term determined from the Glauber part is bistable and balanced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concentrates on the limit behavior of discrete-time branching process with circular mechanism. Three types of limit behaviour of discrete-time branching process with circular mechanism are given explicitly under various moment conditions on branching rates. It is shown that the rate of the first one is geometric, while the other two are supergeometric.</description>

      <title>Peeling the Brownian half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new spatial Markov property of the Brownian half-plane. According to this property, if one removes a hull centered at a boundary point, the remaining space equipped with an intrinsic metric is still a Brownian half-plane, which is independent of the part that has been removed. This is an analog of the well-known peeling procedure for random planar maps. We also investigate several distributional properties of hulls centered at a boundary point, and we provide a new construction of the Brownian half-plane giving information about distances from a half-boundary.</description>

      <title>The link between hyperuniformity, Coulomb energy, and Wasserstein distance to Lebesgue for two-dimensional point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between three possible properties of stationary point processes: i) Finite Coulomb energy with short-scale regularization, ii) Finite $2$-Wasserstein transportation distance to the Lebesgue measure and iii) Hyperuniformity. In dimension $2$, we prove that i) implies ii), which is known to imply iii), and we provide simple counter-examples to both converse implications. However, we prove that ii) implies i) for processes with a uniformly bounded density of points, and that i) - finiteness of the regularized Coulomb energy - is equivalent to a certain property of quantitative hyperuniformity that is just slightly stronger than hyperuniformity itself.
  Our proof relies on the classical link between $H^{-1}$-norm and $2$-Wasserstein distance between measures, on the screening construction for Coulomb gases (of which we present an adaptation to $2$-Wasserstein space which might be of independent interest), and on recent necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary "electric" fields compatible with a given stationary point process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the stochastic reconstruction theorem to a setting where the underlying family of distributions satisfies some natural conditions involving rectangular increments. This allows us to prove the well-posedness of a new class of mixed stochastic partial differential of hyperbolic type which combines standard Walsh stochastic integration and Young products.</description>

      <title>On the determination of path signature from its unitary development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an explicit, constructive approach to determine any element $X$ in the tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)^{\otimes n}$ from its moment generating function. The only assumption is that $X$ has a nonzero radius of convergence, which relaxes the condition of having an infinite radius of convergence in the literature. The key building block of our approach is tridiagonal antisymmetric matrices, whose sparsity offers a considerable advantage for dimension reduction in applications. In particular, specialising $X$ to the signature space of bounded $p$-variation paths in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $1\leq p &lt;2$, we show that the developments of such sparse matrices are sufficient to separate points over the space of signatures, which yields a refined answer to the "moment problem" concerning the signature. Based on the above theoretical investigations, we propose a new distance function for probability measures on the path space, termed as the "Restricted Path Characteristic Function Distance" (RPCFD), and validate its effectiveness via numerical experiments on hypothesis testing for examples of fractional Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>On Approximating the Potts Model with Contracting Glauber Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Potts model on a graph can be approximated by a sequence of independent and identically distributed spins in terms of Wasserstein distance at high temperatures. We prove a similar result for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model on the complete graph, conditioned on being close enough to any of its equilibrium macrostates, in the low-temperature regime. Our proof technique is based on Stein's method for comparing the stationary distributions of two Glauber dynamics with similar updates, one of which is rapid mixing and contracting on a subset of the state space. Along the way, we obtain new upper bounds on the mixing times of the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model on a general bounded-degree graph, and for the conditional measure of the Curie-Weiss-Potts model near an equilibrium macrostate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general black box theorem that ensures convergence of a sequence of stationary Markov processes, provided a few assumptions are satisfied. This theorem relies on a control of the resolvents of the sequence of Markov processes, and on a suitable characterization of the resolvents of the limit. One major advantage of this approach is that it circumvents the use of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: in particular, we deduce in a rather simple way that the stationary fluctuations of the one-dimensional zero-range process converge to the stochastic heat equation. It also allows to establish results that were probably out of reach of existing methods: using the black box result, we are able to prove that the stationary fluctuations of a discrete model of ordered interfaces, that was considered previously in the statistical physics literature, converge to a system of reflected stochastic PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_\star(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs associated to a class of degenerate Fokker-Planck equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the nondegenerate case is well-known, there are only few results on the existence of strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs with coefficients of Nemytskii-type in the degenerate case. We consider a broad class of degenerate nonlinear Fokker-Planck(-Kolmogorov) equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type. This includes, in particular, the classical porous medium equation perturbed by a first-order term with initial datum in a subset of probability densities, which is dense with respect to the topology inherited from $L^1$, and, in the one-dimensional setting, the classical porous medium equation with initial datum in an arbitrary point $x\in\mathbb{R}$. For these kind of equations the existence of a Schwartz-distributional solution $u$ is well-known. We show that there exists a unique strong solution to the associated degenerate McKean-Vlasov SDE with time marginal law densities $u$. In particular, every weak solution to this equation with time marginal law densities $u$ can be written as a functional of the driving Brownian motion.
  Moreover, plugging any Brownian motion into this very functional yields a weak solution with time marginal law densities $u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [HHL+17] the authors showed existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlinear one-dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by a Gaussian noise that is white in time and rougher than white in space (in particular, its covariance is not a measure). Here we present a simple alternative to derive such results by considering the equations in the analytically weak sense, using either the variational approach or Krylov's $L^p$-theory. Various improvements are obtained as corollaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not utilize the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our novel algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. This is achieved by passing information from a cache of constant size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on an example problem.</description>

      <title>On the Rashomon ratio of infinite hypothesis sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a classification problem and a family of classifiers, the Rashomon ratio measures the proportion of classifiers that yield less than a given loss. Previous work has explored the advantage of a large Rashomon ratio in the case of a finite family of classifiers. Here we consider the more general case of an infinite family. We show that a large Rashomon ratio guarantees that choosing the classifier with the best empirical accuracy among a random subset of the family, which is likely to improve generalizability, will not increase the empirical loss too much. We quantify the Rashomon ratio in two examples involving infinite classifier families in order to illustrate situations in which it is large. In the first example, we estimate the Rashomon ratio of the classification of normally distributed classes using an affine classifier. In the second, we obtain a lower bound for the Rashomon ratio of a classification problem with a modified Gram matrix when the classifier family consists of two-layer ReLU neural networks. In general, we show that the Rashomon ratio can be estimated using a training dataset along with random samples from the classifier family and we provide guarantees that such an estimation is close to the true value of the Rashomon ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of efficiently computing the stationary distribution of general classes of structured Markov processes. In strong contrast with previous work, we consider this problem within the context of quantum computational environments from a mathematical perspective and devise the first quantum algorithms for computing the stationary distribution of structured Markov processes. We derive a mathematical analysis of the computational properties of our quantum algorithms together with related theoretical results, establishing that our quantum algorithms provide the potential for significant computational improvements over that of the best-known classical algorithms in various settings of both theoretical and practical importance. Although motivated by structured Markov processes, our quantum algorithms have the potential for being exploited to address a much larger class of numerical computation problems.</description>

      <title>On a Stochastic Differential Equation with Correction Term Governed by a Monotone and Lipschitz Continuous Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our pursuit of finding a zero for a monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator $M : \R^n \rightarrow \R^n$ amidst noisy evaluations, we explore an associated differential equation within a stochastic framework, incorporating a correction term. We present a result establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the stochastic differential equations under examination. Additionally, assuming that the diffusion term is square-integrable, we demonstrate the almost sure convergence of the trajectory process $X(t)$ to a zero of $M$ and of $\|M(X(t))\|$ to $0$ as $t \rightarrow +\infty$. Furthermore, we provide ergodic upper bounds and ergodic convergence rates in expectation for $\|M(X(t))\|^2$ and $\langle M(X(t), X(t)-x^*\rangle$, where $x^*$ is an arbitrary zero of the monotone operator. Subsequently, we apply these findings to a minimax problem. Finally, we analyze two temporal discretizations of the continuous-time models, resulting in stochastic variants of the Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent and Extragradient methods, respectively, and assess their convergence properties.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. In this note we present an alternative proof to a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>

      <title>Curse of Dimensionality on Persistence Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of persistent homology has led to wide applications of the persistence diagram as a trusted topological descriptor in the presence of noise. However, with the increasing demand for high-dimension and low-sample-size data processing in modern science, it is questionable whether persistence diagrams retain their reliability in the presence of high-dimensional noise. This work aims to study the reliability of persistence diagrams in the high-dimension low-sample-size data setting. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of persistence diagrams for high-dimensional random data, we show that persistence diagrams are no longer reliable descriptors of low-sample-size data under high-dimensional noise perturbations. We refer to this loss of reliability of persistence diagrams in such data settings as the curse of dimensionality on persistence diagrams. Next, we investigate the possibility of using normalized principal component analysis as a method for reducing the dimensionality of the high-dimensional observed data to resolve the curse of dimensionality. We show that this method can mitigate the curse of dimensionality on persistence diagrams. Our results shed some new light on the challenges of processing high-dimension low-sample-size data by persistence diagrams and provide a starting point for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>A Note on Asynchronous Challenges: Unveiling Formulaic Bias and Data Loss in the Hayashi-Yoshida Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hayashi-Yoshida (\HY)-estimator exhibits an intrinsic, telescoping property that leads to an often overlooked computational bias, which we denote,formulaic or intrinsic bias. This formulaic bias results in data loss by cancelling out potentially relevant data points, the nonextant data points. This paper attempts to formalize and quantify the data loss arising from this bias. In particular, we highlight the existence of nonextant data points via a concrete example, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the telescoping property to induce this type of formulaic bias.Since this type of bias is nonexistent when inputs, i.e., observation times, $\Pi^{(1)} :=(t_i^{(1)})_{i=0,1,\ldots}$ and $\Pi^{(2)} :=(t_j^{(2)})_{j=0,1,\ldots}$, are synchronous, we introduce the (a,b)-asynchronous adversary. This adversary generates inputs $\Pi^{(1)}$ and $\Pi^{(2)}$ according to two independent homogenous Poisson processes with rates a&gt;0 and b&gt;0, respectively. We address the foundational questions regarding cumulative minimal (or least) average data point loss, and determine the values for a and b. We prove that for equal rates a=b, the minimal average cumulative data loss over both inputs is attained and amounts to 25\%. We present an algorithm, which is based on our theorem, for computing the exact number of nonextant data points given inputs $\Pi^{(1)}$ and $\Pi^{(2)}$, and suggest alternative methods. Finally, we use simulated data to empirically compare the (cumulative) average data loss of the (\HY)-estimator.</description>

      <title>Tensor cumulants for statistical inference on invariant distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems in high-dimensional statistics appear to have a statistical-computational gap: a range of values of the signal-to-noise ratio where inference is information-theoretically possible, but (conjecturally) computationally intractable. A canonical such problem is Tensor PCA, where we observe a tensor $Y$ consisting of a rank-one signal plus Gaussian noise. Multiple lines of work suggest that Tensor PCA becomes computationally hard at a critical value of the signal's magnitude. In particular, below this transition, no low-degree polynomial algorithm can detect the signal with high probability; conversely, various spectral algorithms are known to succeed above this transition. We unify and extend this work by considering tensor networks, orthogonally invariant polynomials where multiple copies of $Y$ are "contracted" to produce scalars, vectors, matrices, or other tensors. We define a new set of objects, tensor cumulants, which provide an explicit, near-orthogonal basis for invariant polynomials of a given degree. This basis lets us unify and strengthen previous results on low-degree hardness, giving a combinatorial explanation of the hardness transition and of a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms that work below it, and proving tight lower bounds against low-degree polynomials for recovering rather than just detecting the signal. It also lets us analyze a new problem of distinguishing between different tensor ensembles, such as Wigner and Wishart tensors, establishing a sharp computational threshold and giving evidence of a new statistical-computational gap in the Central Limit Theorem for random tensors. Finally, we believe these cumulants are valuable mathematical objects in their own right: they generalize the free cumulants of free probability theory from matrices to tensors, and share many of their properties, including additivity under additive free convolution.</description>

      <title>A pure dual approach for hedging Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a new dual approach to compute the hedging portfolio of a Bermudan option and its initial value. It gives a "purely dual" algorithm following the spirit of Rogers (2010) in the sense that it only relies on the dual pricing formula. The key is to rewrite the dual formula as an excess reward representation and to combine it with a strict convexification technique. The hedging strategy is then obtained by using a Monte Carlo method, solving backward a sequence of least square problems. We show convergence results for our algorithm and test it on many different Bermudan options. Beyond giving directly the hedging portfolio, the strength of the algorithm is to assess both the relevance of including financial instruments in the hedging portfolio and the effect of the rebalancing frequency.</description>

Abstract: The spatially dependent wave speed of a stochastic wave equation driven by space-time white noise is estimated using the local observation scheme. Given a fixed time horizon, we prove asymptotic normality for an augmented maximum likelihood estimator as the resolution level of the observations tends to zero. We show that the expectation and variance of the observed Fisher information are intrinsically related to the kinetic energy within an associated deterministic wave equation and prove an asymptotic equipartition of energy principle using the notion of asymptotic Riemann-Lebesgue operators.</description>

      <title>Learning Mixtures of Gaussians Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new algorithm for learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians (with identity covariance in $\mathbb{R}^n$) to TV error $\varepsilon$, with quasi-polynomial ($O(n^{\text{poly log}\left(\frac{n+k}{\varepsilon}\right)})$) time and sample complexity, under a minimum weight assumption. Unlike previous approaches, most of which are algebraic in nature, our approach is analytic and relies on the framework of diffusion models. Diffusion models are a modern paradigm for generative modeling, which typically rely on learning the score function (gradient log-pdf) along a process transforming a pure noise distribution, in our case a Gaussian, to the data distribution. Despite their dazzling performance in tasks such as image generation, there are few end-to-end theoretical guarantees that they can efficiently learn nontrivial families of distributions; we give some of the first such guarantees. We proceed by deriving higher-order Gaussian noise sensitivity bounds for the score functions for a Gaussian mixture to show that that they can be inductively learned using piecewise polynomial regression (up to poly-logarithmic degree), and combine this with known convergence results for diffusion models. Our results extend to continuous mixtures of Gaussians where the mixing distribution is supported on a union of $k$ balls of constant radius. In particular, this applies to the case of Gaussian convolutions of distributions on low-dimensional manifolds, or more generally sets with small covering number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.01800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new percolation model, inspired by recent works on jigsaw percolation, graph bootstrap percolation, and percolation in polluted environments. Start with an oriented graph $G_0$ of initially occupied edges on $n$ vertices, and iteratively occupy additional (oriented) edges by transitivity, with the constraint that only open edges in a certain random set can ever be occupied. All other edges are closed, creating a set of obstacles for the spread of occupied edges. When $G_0$ is an unoriented linear graph, and leftward and rightward edges are open independently with possibly different probabilities, we identify three regimes in which the set of eventually occupied edges is either all open edges, the majority of open edges in one direction, or only a very small proportion of all open edges. In the more general setting where $G_0$ is a connected unoriented graph of bounded degree, we show that the transition between sparse and full occupation of open edges occurs when the probability of open edges is $(\log n)^{-1/2+o(1)}$. We conclude with several conjectures and open problems.</description>

Abstract: We derive a new representation of the Brownian disk in terms of a forest of labeled trees, where labels correspond to distances from a subset of the boundary. We then use this representation to obtain a spatial Markov property showing that the complement of a hull centered at a boundary point of a Brownian disk is again a Brownian disk, with a random perimeter, and is independent of the hull conditionally on its perimeter. Our proofs rely in part on a study of the peeling process for triangulations with a boundary, which is of independent interest. The results of the present work will be applied to a continuous version of the peeling process for the Brownian half-plane in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: We construct a fast exact algorithm for the simulation of the first-passage time, jointly with the undershoot and overshoot, of a tempered stable subordinator over an arbitrary non-increasing absolutely continuous function. We prove that the running time of our algorithm has finite exponential moments and provide bounds on its expected running time with explicit dependence on the characteristics of the process and the initial value of the function. The expected running time grows at most cubically in the stability parameter (as it approaches either $0$ or $1$) and is linear in the tempering parameter and the initial value of the function. Numerical performance, based on the implementation in the dedicated GitHub repository, exhibits a good agreement with our theoretical bounds. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the performance of our algorithm in Monte Carlo estimation.</description>

This is based on the notion of weak Dirichlet process, and extends the $C^1$-It\^o's formula in Gozzi and Russo (2006) to this context. As the first application, we study a class of McKean-Vlasov optimal control problems, and establish a verification theorem which only requires $C^1$-regularity of its value function, which is equivalently the (viscosity) solution of the associated HJB master equation. It goes together with a novel duality result.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the well-posedness of exponential growth backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) driven by a marked point process (MPP) under unbounded terminal conditions. Our analysis utilizes a fixed-point argument, the $\theta$-method, and an approximation procedure. Additionally, we establish the solvability of mean-reflected exponential growth BSDEs driven by the MPP using the $\theta$-method.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional state space collapse in non-complete resource pooling scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper establishes an explicit multi-dimensional state space collapse (SSC) for parallel-processing systems with arbitrary compatibility constraints between servers and job types. This breaks major new ground beyond the SSC results and queue length asymptotics in the literature which are largely restricted to complete resource pooling (CRP) scenarios where the steady-state queue length vector concentrates around a line in heavy traffic. The multi-dimensional SSC that we establish reveals heavy-traffic behavior which is also far more tractable than the pre-limit queue length distribution, yet exhibits a fundamentally more intricate structure than in the one-dimensional case, providing useful insight into the system dynamics. In particular, we prove that the limiting queue length vector lives in a $K$-dimensional cone of which the set of spanning vectors is random in general, capturing the delicate interplay between the various job types and servers. For a broad class of systems we provide a further simplification which shows that the collection of random cones constitutes a fixed $K$-dimensional cone, resulting in a $K$-dimensional SSC. The dimension $K$ represents the number of critically loaded subsystems, or equivalently, capacity bottlenecks in heavy-traffic, with $K=1$ corresponding to conventional CRP scenarios. Our approach leverages probability generating function (PGF) expressions for Markovian systems operating under redundancy policies.</description>

      <title>A note on weak compactness of occupation measures for an absorbing Markov decision process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an absorbing Markov decision process with Borel state and action spaces. We study conditions under which the MDP is uniformly absorbing and the set of occupation measures of the MDP is compact in the usual weak topology. These include suitable continuity requirements on the transition kernel and conditions on the dynamics of the system at the boundary of the absorbing set. We generalize previously known results and give an answer to some conjectures that have been mentioned in the related literature.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the colored ASEP and stochastic six-vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the colored asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and stochastic six vertex (S6V) model with fully packed initial conditions; the states of these models can be encoded by 2-parameter height functions. We show under Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that these height functions converge to the Airy sheet.
  Several corollaries follow. (1) For ASEP and the S6V model under the basic coupling, we consider the 4-parameter height function at position $y$ and time $t$ with a step initial condition at position $x$ and time $s &lt; t$, and prove that under KPZ scaling it converges to the directed landscape. (2) We prove that ASEPs under the basic coupling, with multiple general initial data, converge to KPZ fixed points coupled through the directed landscape. (3) We prove that the colored ASEP stationary measures converge to the stationary horizon. (4) We prove a strong form of decoupling for the colored ASEP height functions, as well as for the stationary two-point function, as broadly predicted by the theory of non-linear fluctuating hydrodynamics.
  The starting point for our Airy sheet convergence result is an embedding of these colored models into a larger structure -- a color-indexed family of coupled line ensembles with an explicit Gibbs property, i.e., a colored Hall-Littlewood line ensemble. The core of our work then becomes to develop a framework to analyze the edge scaling limit of these ensembles.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet heat kernel estimates of subordinate diffusion processes with diffusive components in $C^{1, \alpha}$ open sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive explicit sharp two-sided estimates of the Dirichlet heat kernels for a class of symmetric subordinate diffusion processes with diffusive components in $C^{1, \alpha}(\alpha\in (0, 1])$ open sets in $\mathbb R^d$ when the scaling order of the Laplace exponent of purely discontinuous part of the subordinator is between $0$ and $1$ including $1.$ The main result of this paper shows the stability of Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for such processes in $C^{1, \alpha}$ open sets in the sense that the estimates depend on the divergence elliptic operator only via its uniform ellipticity constant and the Dini continuity modulus of the diffusion coefficients. As a corollary, we obtain the sharp two-sided estimates for Green functions of those processes in bounded $C^{1, \alpha}$ open sets.</description>

      <title>On the size of temporal cliques in subcritical random temporal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \emph{random temporal graph} is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$, together with a random ordering of its edges. A path in the graph is called \emph{increasing} if the edges on the path appear in increasing order. A set $S$ of vertices forms a \emph{temporal clique} if for all $u,v \in S$, there is an increasing path from $u$ to $v$. \cite{Becker2023} proved that if $p=c\log n/n$ for $c&gt;1$, then, with high probability, there is a temporal clique of size $n-o(n)$. On the other hand, for $c&lt;1$, with high probability, the largest temporal clique is of size $o(n)$. In this note we improve the latter bound by showing that, for $c&lt;1$, the largest temporal clique is of \emph{constant} size with high probability.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the effective population size in a branching particle system in the moderate mutation-selection regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of particles performing a one-dimensional dyadic branching Brownian motion with positive drift $\beta\in(0,1)$, branching rate 1/2, killed at $L(\beta)&gt;0$, and reflected at 0. The killing boundary $L(\beta)$ is chosen so that the total population size is approximately constant, proportional to $N\in\mathbb{N}$. This branching system is interpreted as a population accumulating deleterious mutations.
  We prove that, when the typical width of the cloud of particles is of order $c\log(N)$, $c\in(0,1)$, the demographic fluctuations of the system converge to a Feller diffusion on the time scale $N^{1-c}$. In addition, we show that the limiting genealogy of the system comprises only binary mergers and that these mergers are concentrated in the vicinity of the reflective boundary. This model is a version of the branching Brownian motion with absorption studied by Berestycki, Berestycki and Schweinsberg to describe the effect of natural selection on the genealogy of a population accumulating beneficial mutations. In the latter case, the genealogical structure of the system is described by a Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent on a logarithmic time scale. In this work, we show that, when the population size in the fittest class is mesoscopic, namely of order $N^{1-c}$, the genealogy of the system is given by a Kingman coalescent on a polynomial time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.00601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random integers, sampled uniformly from $[1,x]$, share similarities with random permutations, sampled uniformly from $S_n$. These similarities include the Erd\H{o}s--Kac theorem on the distribution of the number of prime factors of a random integer, and Billingsley's theorem on the largest prime factors of a random integer. In this paper we extend this analogy to non-uniform distributions.
  Given a multiplicative function $\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, one may associate with it a measure on the integers in $[1,x]$, where $n$ is sampled with probability proportional to the value $\alpha(n)$. Analogously, given a sequence $\{ \theta_i\}_{i \ge 1}$ of non-negative reals, one may associate with it a measure on $S_n$ that assigns to a permutation a probability proportional to a product of weights over the cycles of the permutation. This measure is known as the generalized Ewens measure.
  We study the case where the mean value of $\alpha$ over primes tends to some positive $\theta$, as well as the weights $\alpha(p) \approx (\log p)^{\gamma}$. In both cases, we obtain results in the integer setting which are in agreement with those in the permutation setting.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the ELBO to Entropy Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03077v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variational lower bound (a.k.a. ELBO or free energy) is the central objective for many established as well as many novel algorithms for unsupervised learning. During learning such algorithms change model parameters to increase the variational lower bound. Learning usually proceeds until parameters have converged to values close to a stationary point of the learning dynamics. In this purely theoretical contribution, we show that (for a very large class of generative models) the variational lower bound is at all stationary points of learning equal to a sum of entropies. For standard machine learning models with one set of latents and one set of observed variables, the sum consists of three entropies: (A) the (average) entropy of the variational distributions, (B) the negative entropy of the model's prior distribution, and (C) the (expected) negative entropy of the observable distribution. The obtained result applies under realistic conditions including: finite numbers of data points, at any stationary point (including saddle points) and for any family of (well behaved) variational distributions. The class of generative models for which we show the equality to entropy sums contains many well-known generative models. As concrete examples we discuss Sigmoid Belief Networks, probabilistic PCA and (Gaussian and non-Gaussian) mixture models. The result also applies for standard (Gaussian) variational autoencoders, a special case that has been shown previously (Damm et al., 2023). The prerequisites we use to show equality to entropy sums are relatively mild. Concretely, the distributions of a given generative model have to be of the exponential family, and the model has to satisfy a parameterization criterion (which is usually fulfilled). Proving the equality of the ELBO to entropy sums at stationary points (under the stated conditions) is the main contribution of this work.</description>

      <title>Cores of partitions in rectangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $t \geq 2$, the $t$-core of a partition plays an important role in modular representation theory and combinatorics. We initiate the study of $t$-cores of partitions contained in an $r \times s$ rectangle. Our main results are as follows. We first give a simple formula for the number of partitions in the rectangle that are themselves $t$-cores and compute its asymptotics for large $r,s$. We then prove that the number of partitions inside the rectangle whose $t$-cores are a fixed partition $\rho$ is given by a product of binomial coefficients. Finally, we use this formula to compute the distribution of the $t$-core of a uniformly random partition inside the rectangle extending our previous work on all partitions of a fixed integer $n$ (Ann. Appl. Prob. 2023). In particular, we show that in the limit as $r,s \to \infty$ maintaining a fixed aspect ratio, we again obtain a Gamma distribution with the same shape parameter $\alpha = (t-1)/2$ and rate parameter $\beta$ that depends on the aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online SGD in High-dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has emerged as the quintessential method in a data scientist's toolbox. Using SGD for high-stakes applications requires, however, careful quantification of the associated uncertainty. Towards that end, in this work, we establish a high-dimensional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for linear functionals of online SGD iterates for overparametrized least-squares regression with non-isotropic Gaussian inputs. Our result shows that a CLT holds even when the dimensionality is of order exponential in the number of iterations of the online SGD, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such result. In order to use the developed result in practice, we further develop an online approach for estimating the expectation and the variance terms appearing in the CLT, and establish high-probability bounds for the developed online estimator. Furthermore, we propose a two-step fully online bias-correction methodology which together with the CLT result and the variance estimation result, provides a fully online and data-driven way to numerically construct confidence intervals, thereby enabling practical high-dimensional algorithmic inference with SGD. We also extend our results to a class of single-index models, based on the Gaussian Stein's identity. We also provide numerical simulations to verify our theoretical findings in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of a run and tumble model which is a kinetic-transport equation describing bacterial movement under the effect of a chemical stimulus. The experiments suggest that the non-uniform tumbling kernels are physically relevant ones as opposed to the uniform tumbling kernel which is widely considered in the literature to reduce the complexity of the mathematical analysis. We consider two cases: (i) the tumbling kernel depends on the angle between pre- and post-tumbling velocities, (ii) the velocity space is unbounded and the post-tumbling velocities follow the Maxwellian velocity distribution. We prove that the probability density distribution of bacteria converges to an equilibrium distribution with explicit (exponential for (i) and algebraic for (ii)) convergence rates, for any probability measure initial data. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first results concerning the long-time behaviour of run and tumble equations with non-uniform tumbling kernels.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

Abstract: We consider periodic homogenisation problems for gPAM, $\Phi^{4}_{3}$ and modified KPZ equations. Using Littlewood-Paley blocks, we establish para-products and commutator estimates for generalised Besov spaces associated with self-adjoint elliptic operators. With this, we show that, the homogenisation and renormalisation procedures commute in aforementioned models under suitable assumptions.</description>
