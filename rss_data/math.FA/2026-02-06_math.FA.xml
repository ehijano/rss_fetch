      <title>On complex structures and uniqueness of algebra norms in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $X$ an infinite dimensional Banach space, we contribute to the study of the Banach algebra $L(X)/S(X)$, where $S(X)$ is the ideal of strictly singular operators. We extend results of Ferenczi-Galego (2007) by proving that $\|I-J\|_S \geq 2$, whenever $I$ is a complex structure on a real space $X$ and $J$ extends a complex structure on a hyperplane of $X$, and where $\|.\|_S$ denotes a certain algebra norm on $L(X)/S(X)$ dominated by the usual quotient norm $\|.\|$. We solve two questions of Kalton-Swanson (1982) by proving that if $X=Z_2$ the Kalton-Peck space, then $L(Z_2)/S(Z_2)$ a) is not complete for $\|.\|_S$ and b) that it is not *-isomorphic to a $C^*$-algebra for $\|.\|$. In particular $L(Z_2)/S(Z_2)$ admits two inequivalent *-algebra norms.</description>

      <title>Relaxation in infinite convex programming under Slater-type regularity conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to close the gap between the optimal values of an infinite convex program and that of its biconjugate relaxation. It is shown that Slater and continuity-type conditions guarantee such a zero-duality gap. The approach uses calculus rules for the conjugation and biconjugation of the sum and pointwise supremum operations. A second important objective of this work is to exploit these results on relaxation by applying them in the context of duality theory.</description>

      <title>On the Resistance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the resistance conjecture on characterization of parabolic Harnack inequalities in terms of volume doubling, upper capacity bounds and a Poincar\'e inequalities. The key step is to show that these three assumptions imply the so called cutoff Sobolev inequality, an important inequality in the study of anomalous diffusions, Dirichlet forms and re-scaled energies in fractals. This implication is shown in the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet Spaces introduced by the author and Murugan, and thus a unified treatment becomes possible to proving Harnack inequalities and stability phenomena in both analysis on metric spaces and fractals and for graphs and manifolds for all exponents $p\in (1,\infty)$. As an application, we also show that a Dirichlet space satisfying volume doubling, Poincar\'e and upper capacity bounds has finite martingale dimension and admits a type of differential structure similar to the work of Cheeger. In the course of the proof, we establish methods of extension and characterizations of Sobolev functions by Poincar\'e-inequalities, and extend the methods of Jones and Koskela to the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet spaces.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Accelerated Neural Network Interpolation Operators on Irregular Grids with Higher Order Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of \emph{Taylor-accelerated neural network interpolation operators} is introduced on quasi-uniform irregular grids. These operators improve existing neural network interpolation operators by incorporating Taylor polynomials at the sampling nodes, thereby exploiting the higher smoothness of the target function. The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Direct approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular partitions, including Lagrange-based schemes.</description>

      <title>The sharp Whitney extension theorem for convex $C^1$ Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an arbitrary set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and functions $f:E \to \mathbb{R}$, $G: E\to \mathbb{R}^n$ with $G$ bounded, we construct $C^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ convex extensions $(F, \nabla F)$ of $(f,G)$ with the sharp Lipschitz constant
  $$
  \mathrm{Lip}(F) = \sup_{x\in E} |G(x)|,
  $$
  provided that $(f,G)$ satisfies the pertinent necessary and sufficient conditions for $C^1$ convex, and Lipschitz extendability. Also, these extensions can be constructed with prescribed global behavior in terms of directions of coercivity.</description>

      <title>Nehari's Theorem and Hardy's inequality for Paley--Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it was proven that for a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that has infinitely many extreme vectors, the Nehari theorem fails, that is, there exists a bounded Hankel operator $\Ha_{\phi}$ on the Paley--Wiener space $\PW(\Omega)$ that does not admit a bounded symbol. In this paper we examine whether Nehari's theorem can hold under the stronger assumption that the Hankel operator $\Ha_{\phi}$ is in the Schatten class $S^{p}(\PW(\Omega))$. We prove that this fails for $p&gt;4$ for any convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\geq2$, of boundary with a $C^{2}$ neighborhood of nonzero curvature. Furthermore we prove that for a polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the inequality $$\int_{2P}\dfrac{|\widehat{f}(x)|}{m(P\cap (x-P))}dx\leq C(P)\|f\|_{L^{1}},$$ holds for all $f\in \PW^{1}(2P)$, and consequently any Hilbert--Schmidt Hankel operator on a Paley--Wiener space of a polytope is generated by a bounded function.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that weak quasistability does not imply power boundedness, but coercive power unbounded operators cannot be weakly quasistable.\ Although a finite measure over the unit disc is a Rajchman measure if and only if the position operator is weakly stable, it is shown that the position operator is weakly quasistable for every finite continuous measure over the unit disc.\ Corollaries linking Rajchman measures with weak stability and weak quasistability follow the above results.\</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the well-known Birkhoff-Kellogg invariant-direction Theorem in product spaces. Our results concern operator systems and give the existence of component-wise eigenvalues, instead of scalar eigenvalues as in the classical case, that have corresponding eigenvectors with all components nontrivial and localized by their norm. We also show that, when applied to nonlinear eigenvalue problems for differential equations, this localization property of the eigenvectors provides, in turn, qualitative properties of the solutions. This is illustrated in two contexts of systems of PDEs and ODEs. We show the applicability of our theoretical results with two explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Extending wavelet regularity beyond Gevrey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a smooth orthonormal wavelet $\psi$ such that both $\psi$ and its Fourier transform $\widehat{\psi}$ belong to the extended Gevrey class $\mathcal{E}_{\sigma}(\mathbb{R})$ for $\sigma &gt; 1$, providing an example that lies beyond all classical Gevrey classes. Our approach uses the idea of invariant cycles to extend the initial Lemari\'e-Meyer support of the low-pass filter $m_0$ from $ [-\frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{2\pi}{3}]$ to $ [-\frac{4\pi}{5}, \frac{4\pi}{5}]$. This extension allows us to control the decay rate of $m_0$ near $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, which yields global decay estimates for $\psi$ and $\hat\psi$. In addition, the decay rates are described using special functions involving the Lambert W function, which plays an important role in our construction.</description>

      <title>Baire-type properties of topological vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burzyk, Kli\'{s} and Lipecki proved that every topological vector space (tvs) $E$ with the property $(K)$ is a Baire space. K\c{a}kol and S\'{a}nchez Ruiz proved that every sequentially complete Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn locally convex space (lcs) is Baire. Being motivated by the property $(K)$ and the notion of a Mackey null sequence we introduce a property $(MK)$ which is strictly weaker than the property $(K)$, and show that any locally complete lcs has the property $(MK)$. We prove that any $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn tvs with the property $(MK)$ is a Baire space; consequently, each locally complete $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn lcs is a Baire space. This generalizes both the aforementioned results. We construct a feral Baire space $E$ with the property $(K)$ and which is not $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn. Although a $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn lcs $E$ can be not a Baire space, we show that $E$ is always $b$-Baire-like in the sense of Ruess. Applications to spaces of Baire functions and $C_k$-spaces are given.</description>

      <title>Bourgain-Morrey sequence spaces: structural properties, relations to classical $\ell^{p}$ spaces and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete Bourgain-Morrey sequence spaces $\ell^{p}_{q,r}(\mathbb{Z})$, recently introduced as discrete counterparts of Morrey-type spaces. We show that $c_{00}$ is dense in $\ell^{p}_{q,r}$, hence the spaces are separable. We establish embeddings $\ell^{1}\hookrightarrow \ell^{p}_{q,r}\hookrightarrow \ell^{r}$ for $r&gt;1$, while for $r=1$ one has $\ell^{p}_{q,1}=\ell^{1}$. For each $p$, the identity $\ell^{p}_{q,p}=\ell^{p}$ yields uncountably many equivalent norms on $\ell^{p}$. We also introduce a block space as a natural predual of $\ell^{p}_{q,r}$ and prove the duality $(\ell^{p}_{q,r})^{*}=\mathrm{h}^{p'}_{q',r'}$, from which reflexivity follows for $1&lt;p&lt;q&lt;\infty$ and $1&lt;r&lt;\infty$. This work completes the foundational stage of the discrete Bourgain-Morrey theory by fully characterizing its structure and duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Neural Network that approximates the matrix multiplication operator for any activation function such that there exists a Neural Network which can approximate the scalar multiplication function. In particular, we use the Strassen algorithm to reduce the number of weights and layers needed for such Neural Networks. This allows us to define another Neural Network for approximating the inverse matrix operator. Also, by relying on the Galerkin method, we apply those Neural Networks to solve parametric elliptic PDEs for a whole set of parameters. Finally, we discuss improvements with respect to the prior results.</description>

      <title>Estimating the spectral radius of Bell-type operator via finite dimensional approximation of orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a new decomposition formula for two orthogonal projections P and Q on a separable Hilbert space V. This formula yields an orthogonal direct sum decomposition of V into invariant subspaces under P and Q, each of which is either at most two dimensional or infinite dimensional. On every infinite dimensional component, the pair (P,Q) admits a matrix representation that we call the "one-shifted form". This representation diagonalizes both P and Q into blocks of size at most two, and moreover, both projections can be explicitly approximated by orthogonal projections on finite dimensional subspaces. This approximation scheme offers a way to derive infinite dimensional results from their finite dimensional counterparts and is also useful in numerical computations.
  This decomposition provides a useful framework for analyzing a wide range of problems involving two orthogonal projections in infinite dimensions. In particular, several spectral problems for operators generated by P and Q (including polynomials in P and Q) can be reduced to the case where the pair admits a one-shifted form.
  More concretely, we can estimate the spectral radius of [P,Q], which is equivalent to estimating the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator, a quantity of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics. We provide an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral radius of [P,Q], which become exact when the matrix representations of P and Q are in "constant-angle one-shifted form".</description>

      <title>$K$-theory of ghostly ideals for $\ell^p$-coarsely embeddable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ghostly ideals are among the most mysterious objects in coarse index theory. In this paper, we show that if a metric space $X$ with bounded geometry admits a coarse embedding into an $\ell^p$-space ($1 \le p &lt; \infty$), then the canonical inclusion from any geometric ideal to the corresponding ghostly ideal induces an isomorphism in $K$-theory. As consequences, we deduce that such spaces satisfy the relative coarse Baum-Connes conjectures, as well as the operator norm localization property for finite rank projections ($ONL_{\mathcal P_{Fin}}$).</description>
