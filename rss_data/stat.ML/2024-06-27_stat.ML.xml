      <title>Distribution Learnability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relationship between learnability and robust (or agnostic) learnability for the problem of distribution learning. We show that, contrary to other learning settings (e.g., PAC learning of function classes), realizable learnability of a class of probability distributions does not imply its agnostic learnability. We go on to examine what type of data corruption can disrupt the learnability of a distribution class and what is such learnability robust against. We show that realizable learnability of a class of distributions implies its robust learnability with respect to only additive corruption, but not against subtractive corruption.
  We also explore related implications in the context of compression schemes and differentially private learnability.</description>

      <title>Treatment of Statistical Estimation Problems in Randomized Smoothing for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a popular certified defense against adversarial attacks. In its essence, we need to solve a problem of statistical estimation which is usually very time-consuming since we need to perform numerous (usually $10^5$) forward passes of the classifier for every point to be certified. In this paper, we review the statistical estimation problems for randomized smoothing to find out if the computational burden is necessary. In particular, we consider the (standard) task of adversarial robustness where we need to decide if a point is robust at a certain radius or not using as few samples as possible while maintaining statistical guarantees. We present estimation procedures employing confidence sequences enjoying the same statistical guarantees as the standard methods, with the optimal sample complexities for the estimation task and empirically demonstrate their good performance. Additionally, we provide a randomized version of Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals resulting in strictly stronger certificates.</description>

      <title>Learning for Bandits under Action Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel multi-arm bandit (MAB) setup, where a learner needs to communicate the actions to distributed agents over erasure channels, while the rewards for the actions are directly available to the learner through external sensors. In our model, while the distributed agents know if an action is erased, the central learner does not (there is no feedback), and thus does not know whether the observed reward resulted from the desired action or not. We propose a scheme that can work on top of any (existing or future) MAB algorithm and make it robust to action erasures. Our scheme results in a worst-case regret over action-erasure channels that is at most a factor of $O(1/\sqrt{1-\epsilon})$ away from the no-erasure worst-case regret of the underlying MAB algorithm, where $\epsilon$ is the erasure probability. We also propose a modification of the successive arm elimination algorithm and prove that its worst-case regret is $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT}+K/(1-\epsilon))$, which we prove is optimal by providing a matching lower bound.</description>

      <title>Sparse deep neural networks for nonparametric estimation in high-dimensional sparse regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization theory has been established for sparse deep neural networks under high-dimensional regime. Beyond generalization, parameter estimation is also important since it is crucial for variable selection and interpretability of deep neural networks. Current theoretical studies concerning parameter estimation mainly focus on two-layer neural networks, which is due to the fact that the convergence of parameter estimation heavily relies on the regularity of the Hessian matrix, while the Hessian matrix of deep neural networks is highly singular. To avoid the unidentifiability of deep neural networks in parameter estimation, we propose to conduct nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives with respect to inputs. We first show that model convergence of sparse deep neural networks is guaranteed in that the sample complexity only grows with the logarithm of the number of parameters or the input dimension when the $\ell_{1}$-norm of parameters is well constrained. Then by bounding the norm and the divergence of partial derivatives, we establish that the convergence rate of nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$, a rate which is slower than the model convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$. To the best of our knowledge, this study combines nonparametric estimation and parametric sparse deep neural networks for the first time. As nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives is of great significance for nonlinear variable selection, the current results show the promising future for the interpretability of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Boundary Detection Algorithm Inspired by Locally Linear Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of high-dimensional data, it is often assumed that the data set possesses an underlying lower-dimensional structure. A practical model for this structure is an embedded compact manifold with boundary. Since the underlying manifold structure is typically unknown, identifying boundary points from the data distributed on the manifold is crucial for various applications. In this work, we propose a method for detecting boundary points inspired by the widely used locally linear embedding algorithm. We implement this method using two nearest neighborhood search schemes: the $\epsilon$-radius ball scheme and the $K$-nearest neighbor scheme. This algorithm incorporates the geometric information of the data structure, particularly through its close relation with the local covariance matrix. We discuss the selection the key parameter and analyze the algorithm through our exploration of the spectral properties of the local covariance matrix in both neighborhood search schemes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the algorithm's performance with simulated examples.</description>

      <title>What type of inference is planning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple types of inference are available for probabilistic graphical models, e.g., marginal, maximum-a-posteriori, and even marginal maximum-a-posteriori. Which one do researchers mean when they talk about "planning as inference"? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weightings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, and that planning corresponds _exactly_ to a _different_ set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space. The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed in the International Planning Competition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Document Ranking with Learnable Late Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Encoder (CE) and Dual-Encoder (DE) models are two fundamental approaches for query-document relevance in information retrieval. To predict relevance, CE models use joint query-document embeddings, while DE models maintain factorized query and document embeddings; usually, the former has higher quality while the latter benefits from lower latency. Recently, late-interaction models have been proposed to realize more favorable latency-quality tradeoffs, by using a DE structure followed by a lightweight scorer based on query and document token embeddings. However, these lightweight scorers are often hand-crafted, and there is no understanding of their approximation power; further, such scorers require access to individual document token embeddings, which imposes an increased latency and storage burden. In this paper, we propose novel learnable late-interaction models (LITE) that resolve these issues. Theoretically, we prove that LITE is a universal approximator of continuous scoring functions, even for relatively small embedding dimension. Empirically, LITE outperforms previous late-interaction models such as ColBERT on both in-domain and zero-shot re-ranking tasks. For instance, experiments on MS MARCO passage re-ranking show that LITE not only yields a model with better generalization, but also lowers latency and requires 0.25x storage compared to ColBERT.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Networks with Sparse Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core component present in many successful neural network architectures, is an MLP block of two fully connected layers with a non-linear activation in between. An intriguing phenomenon observed empirically, including in transformer architectures, is that, after training, the activations in the hidden layer of this MLP block tend to be extremely sparse on any given input. Unlike traditional forms of sparsity, where there are neurons/weights which can be deleted from the network, this form of {\em dynamic} activation sparsity appears to be harder to exploit to get more efficient networks. Motivated by this we initiate a formal study of PAC learnability of MLP layers that exhibit activation sparsity. We present a variety of results showing that such classes of functions do lead to provable computational and statistical advantages over their non-sparse counterparts. Our hope is that a better theoretical understanding of {\em sparsely activated} networks would lead to methods that can exploit activation sparsity in practice.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dual Coordinate Descent for Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual Coordinate Descent (DCD) and Block Dual Coordinate Descent (BDCD) are important iterative methods for solving convex optimization problems. In this work, we develop scalable DCD and BDCD methods for the kernel support vector machines (K-SVM) and kernel ridge regression (K-RR) problems. On distributed-memory parallel machines the scalability of these methods is limited by the need to communicate every iteration. On modern hardware where communication is orders of magnitude more expensive, the running time of the DCD and BDCD methods is dominated by communication cost. We address this communication bottleneck by deriving $s$-step variants of DCD and BDCD for solving the K-SVM and K-RR problems, respectively. The $s$-step variants reduce the frequency of communication by a tunable factor of $s$ at the expense of additional bandwidth and computation. The $s$-step variants compute the same solution as the existing methods in exact arithmetic. We perform numerical experiments to illustrate that the $s$-step variants are also numerically stable in finite-arithmetic, even for large values of $s$. We perform theoretical analysis to bound the computation and communication costs of the newly designed variants, up to leading order. Finally, we develop high performance implementations written in C and MPI and present scaling experiments performed on a Cray EX cluster. The new $s$-step variants achieved strong scaling speedups of up to $9.8\times$ over existing methods using up to $512$ cores.</description>

      <title>Boosting Soft Q-Learning by Bounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An agent's ability to leverage past experience is critical for efficiently solving new tasks. Prior work has focused on using value function estimates to obtain zero-shot approximations for solutions to a new task. In soft Q-learning, we show how any value function estimate can also be used to derive double-sided bounds on the optimal value function. The derived bounds lead to new approaches for boosting training performance which we validate experimentally. Notably, we find that the proposed framework suggests an alternative method for updating the Q-function, leading to boosted performance.</description>

      <title>Local Linear Recovery Guarantee of Deep Neural Networks at Overparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether deep neural network (DNN) models can reliably recover target functions at overparameterization is a critical yet complex issue in the theory of deep learning. To advance understanding in this area, we introduce a concept we term "local linear recovery" (LLR), a weaker form of target function recovery that renders the problem more amenable to theoretical analysis. In the sense of LLR, we prove that functions expressible by narrower DNNs are guaranteed to be recoverable from fewer samples than model parameters. Specifically, we establish upper limits on the optimistic sample sizes, defined as the smallest sample size necessary to guarantee LLR, for functions in the space of a given DNN. Furthermore, we prove that these upper bounds are achieved in the case of two-layer tanh neural networks. Our research lays a solid groundwork for future investigations into the recovery capabilities of DNNs in overparameterized scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Explanation Estimation with Distribution Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact computation of various machine learning explanations requires numerous model evaluations and in extreme cases becomes impractical. The computational cost of approximation increases with an ever-increasing size of data and model parameters. Many heuristics have been proposed to approximate post-hoc explanations efficiently. This paper shows that the standard i.i.d. sampling used in a broad spectrum of algorithms for explanation estimation leads to an approximation error worthy of improvement. To this end, we introduce Compress Then Explain (CTE), a new paradigm for more efficient and accurate explanation estimation. CTE uses distribution compression through kernel thinning to obtain a data sample that best approximates the marginal distribution. We show that CTE improves the estimation of removal-based local and global explanations with negligible computational overhead. It often achieves an on-par explanation approximation error using 2-3x less samples, i.e. requiring 2-3x less model evaluations. CTE is a simple, yet powerful, plug-in for any explanation method that now relies on i.i.d. sampling.</description>

      <title>Learning pure quantum states (almost) without regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum state tomography with minimal regret. A learner has sequential oracle access to an unknown pure quantum state, and in each round selects a pure probe state. Regret is incurred if the unknown state is measured orthogonal to this probe, and the learner's goal is to minimise the expected cumulative regret over $T$ rounds. The challenge is to find a balance between the most informative measurements and measurements incurring minimal regret. We show that the cumulative regret scales as $\Theta(\operatorname{polylog} T)$ using a new tomography algorithm based on a median of means least squares estimator. This algorithm employs measurements biased towards the unknown state and produces online estimates that are optimal (up to logarithmic terms) in the number of observed samples.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs dream of elephants (when told not to)? Latent concept association and associative memory in transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capacity to store and recall facts. Through experimentation with open-source models, we observe that this ability to retrieve facts can be easily manipulated by changing contexts, even without altering their factual meanings. These findings highlight that LLMs might behave like an associative memory model where certain tokens in the contexts serve as clues to retrieving facts. We mathematically explore this property by studying how transformers, the building blocks of LLMs, can complete such memory tasks. We study a simple latent concept association problem with a one-layer transformer and we show theoretically and empirically that the transformer gathers information using self-attention and uses the value matrix for associative memory.</description>

Abstract: Supervised learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and vector-valued RKHS (vvRKHS) has been investigated for more than 30 years. In this paper, we provide a new twist to this rich literature by generalizing supervised learning in RKHS and vvRKHS to reproducing kernel Hilbert $C^*$-module (RKHM), and show how to construct effective positive-definite kernels by considering the perspective of $C^*$-algebra. Unlike the cases of RKHS and vvRKHS, we can use $C^*$-algebras to enlarge representation spaces. This enables us to construct RKHMs whose representation power goes beyond RKHSs, vvRKHSs, and existing methods such as convolutional neural networks. Our framework is suitable, for example, for effectively analyzing image data by allowing the interaction of Fourier components.</description>

      <title>STEEL: Singularity-aware Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13152v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Batch reinforcement learning (RL) aims at leveraging pre-collected data to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected total rewards in a dynamic environment. The existing methods require absolutely continuous assumption (e.g., there do not exist non-overlapping regions) on the distribution induced by target policies with respect to the data distribution over either the state or action or both. We propose a new batch RL algorithm that allows for singularity for both state and action spaces (e.g., existence of non-overlapping regions between offline data distribution and the distribution induced by the target policies) in the setting of an infinite-horizon Markov decision process with continuous states and actions. We call our algorithm STEEL: SingulariTy-awarE rEinforcement Learning. Our algorithm is motivated by a new error analysis on off-policy evaluation, where we use maximum mean discrepancy, together with distributionally robust optimization, to characterize the error of off-policy evaluation caused by the possible singularity and to enable model extrapolation. By leveraging the idea of pessimism and under some technical conditions, we derive a first finite-sample regret guarantee for our proposed algorithm under singularity. Compared with existing algorithms,by requiring only minimal data-coverage assumption, STEEL improves the applicability and robustness of batch RL. In addition, a two-step adaptive STEEL, which is nearly tuning-free, is proposed. Extensive simulation studies and one (semi)-real experiment on personalized pricing demonstrate the superior performance of our methods in dealing with possible singularity in batch RL.</description>

      <title>Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized pricing, which involves tailoring prices based on individual characteristics, is commonly used by firms to implement a consumer-specific pricing policy. In this process, buyers can also strategically manipulate their feature data to obtain a lower price, incurring certain manipulation costs. Such strategic behavior can hinder firms from maximizing their profits. In this paper, we study the contextual dynamic pricing problem with strategic buyers. The seller does not observe the buyer's true feature, but a manipulated feature according to buyers' strategic behavior. In addition, the seller does not observe the buyers' valuation of the product, but only a binary response indicating whether a sale happens or not. Recognizing these challenges, we propose a strategic dynamic pricing policy that incorporates the buyers' strategic behavior into the online learning to maximize the seller's cumulative revenue. We first prove that existing non-strategic pricing policies that neglect the buyers' strategic behavior result in a linear $\Omega(T)$ regret with $T$ the total time horizon, indicating that these policies are not better than a random pricing policy. We then establish that our proposed policy achieves a sublinear regret upper bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Importantly, our policy is not a mere amalgamation of existing dynamic pricing policies and strategic behavior handling algorithms. Our policy can also accommodate the scenario when the marginal cost of manipulation is unknown in advance. To account for it, we simultaneously estimate the valuation parameter and the cost parameter in the online pricing policy, which is shown to also achieve an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound. Extensive experiments support our theoretical developments and demonstrate the superior performance of our policy compared to other pricing policies that are unaware of the strategic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Noise: Blind Denoising with Gibbs Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, denoising problems have become intertwined with the development of deep generative models. In particular, diffusion models are trained like denoisers, and the distribution they model coincide with denoising priors in the Bayesian picture. However, denoising through diffusion-based posterior sampling requires the noise level and covariance to be known, preventing blind denoising. We overcome this limitation by introducing Gibbs Diffusion (GDiff), a general methodology addressing posterior sampling of both the signal and the noise parameters. Assuming arbitrary parametric Gaussian noise, we develop a Gibbs algorithm that alternates sampling steps from a conditional diffusion model trained to map the signal prior to the family of noise distributions, and a Monte Carlo sampler to infer the noise parameters. Our theoretical analysis highlights potential pitfalls, guides diagnostic usage, and quantifies errors in the Gibbs stationary distribution caused by the diffusion model. We showcase our method for 1) blind denoising of natural images involving colored noises with unknown amplitude and spectral index, and 2) a cosmology problem, namely the analysis of cosmic microwave background data, where Bayesian inference of "noise" parameters means constraining models of the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based methods for statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimisation libraries and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortised, in the sense that they allow rapid inference through fast feedforward operations. In this article we review recent progress in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, summary-statistic construction, and likelihood approximation. We also cover software, and include a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortised inference and the benefits they offer over Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions.</description>

      <title>Learning with Norm Constrained, Over-parameterized, Two-layer Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies show that a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is not a suitable space to model functions by neural networks as the curse of dimensionality (CoD) cannot be evaded when trying to approximate even a single ReLU neuron (Bach, 2017). In this paper, we study a suitable function space for over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with bounded norms (e.g., the path norm, the Barron norm) in the perspective of sample complexity and generalization properties. First, we show that the path norm (as well as the Barron norm) is able to obtain width-independence sample complexity bounds, which allows for uniform convergence guarantees. Based on this result, we derive the improved result of metric entropy for $\epsilon$-covering up to $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{2d}{d+2}})$ ($d$ is the input dimension and the depending constant is at most linear order of $d$) via the convex hull technique, which demonstrates the separation with kernel methods with $\Omega(\epsilon^{-d})$ to learn the target function in a Barron space. Second, this metric entropy result allows for building a sharper generalization bound under a general moment hypothesis setting, achieving the rate at $O(n^{-\frac{d+2}{2d+2}})$. Our analysis is novel in that it offers a sharper and refined estimation for metric entropy with a linear dimension dependence and unbounded sampling in the estimation of the sample error and the output error.</description>

      <title>Scaling and renormalization in high-dimensional regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a succinct derivation of the training and generalization performance of a variety of high-dimensional ridge regression models using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability. We provide an introduction and review of recent results on these topics, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. Analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors are obtained in a few lines of algebra directly from the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. This allows for a straightforward identification of the sources of power-law scaling in model performance. We compute the generalization error of a broad class of random feature models. We find that in all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. These novel results allow us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to model optimal exercise strategies for option-type products. We pursue the RL avenue in order to learn the optimal action-value function of the underlying stopping problem. In addition to retrieving the optimal Q-function at any time step, one can also price the contract at inception. We first discuss the standard setting with one exercise right, and later extend this framework to the case of multiple stopping opportunities in the presence of constraints. We propose to approximate the Q-function with a deep neural network, which does not require the specification of basis functions as in the least-squares Monte Carlo framework and is scalable to higher dimensions. We derive a lower bound on the option price obtained from the trained neural network and an upper bound from the dual formulation of the stopping problem, which can also be expressed in terms of the Q-function. Our methodology is illustrated with examples covering the pricing of swing options.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04620v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimates are important in sequential model-based decision-making tasks such as Bayesian optimization. However, these estimates can be imperfect if the data violates assumptions made by the model (e.g., Gaussianity). This paper studies which uncertainties are needed in model-based decision-making and in Bayesian optimization, and argues that uncertainties can benefit from calibration -- i.e., an 80% predictive interval should contain the true outcome 80% of the time. Maintaining calibration, however, can be challenging when the data is non-stationary and depends on our actions. We propose using simple algorithms based on online learning to provably maintain calibration on non-i.i.d. data, and we show how to integrate these algorithms in Bayesian optimization with minimal overhead. Empirically, we find that calibrated Bayesian optimization converges to better optima in fewer steps, and we demonstrate improved performance on standard benchmark functions and hyperparameter optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>ReLU Neural Networks with Linear Layers are Biased Towards Single- and Multi-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks often operate in the overparameterized regime, in which there are far more parameters than training samples, allowing the training data to be fit perfectly. That is, training the network effectively learns an interpolating function, and properties of the interpolant affect predictions the network will make on new samples. This manuscript explores how properties of such functions learned by neural networks of depth greater than two layers. Our framework considers a family of networks of varying depths that all have the same capacity but different representation costs. The representation cost of a function induced by a neural network architecture is the minimum sum of squared weights needed for the network to represent the function; it reflects the function space bias associated with the architecture. Our results show that adding additional linear layers to the input side of a shallow ReLU network yields a representation cost favoring functions with low mixed variation - that is, it has limited variation in directions orthogonal to a low-dimensional subspace and can be well approximated by a single- or multi-index model. Such functions may be represented by the composition of a function with low two-layer representation cost and a low-rank linear operator. Our experiments confirm this behavior in standard network training regimes. They additionally show that linear layers can improve generalization and the learned network is well-aligned with the true latent low-dimensional linear subspace when data is generated using a multi-index model.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Learning Method for Estimation of Causal Excursion Effects to Assess Time-Varying Moderation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twin revolutions in wearable technologies and health interventions delivered by smartphones have greatly increased the accessibility of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are designed to assess the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention and introduce a novel class of causal estimands called "causal excursion effects." These estimands enable the evaluation of how intervention effects change over time and are influenced by individual characteristics or context. However, existing analysis methods for causal excursion effects require prespecified features of the observed high-dimensional history to build a working model for a critical nuisance parameter. Machine learning appears ideal for automatic feature construction, but their naive application can lead to bias under model misspecification. To address this issue, this paper revisits the estimation of causal excursion effects from a meta-learner perspective, where the analyst remains agnostic to the supervised learning algorithms used to estimate nuisance parameters. We present the bidirectional asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and compare them both theoretically and through extensive simulations. The results show relative efficiency gains and support the suggestion of a doubly robust alternative to existing methods. Finally, the proposed methods' practical utilities are demonstrated by analyzing data from a multi-institution cohort of first-year medical residents in the United States (NeCamp et al., 2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists often want to learn about cause and effect from hierarchical data, collected from subunits nested inside units. Consider students in schools, cells in patients, or cities in states. In such settings, unit-level variables (e.g. each school's budget) may affect subunit-level variables (e.g. the test scores of each student in each school) and vice versa. To address causal questions with hierarchical data, we propose hierarchical causal models, which extend structural causal models and causal graphical models by adding inner plates. We develop a general graphical identification technique for hierarchical causal models that extends do-calculus. We find many situations in which hierarchical data can enable causal identification even when it would be impossible with non-hierarchical data, that is, if we had only unit-level summaries of subunit-level variables (e.g. the school's average test score, rather than each student's score). We develop estimation techniques for hierarchical causal models, using methods including hierarchical Bayesian models. We illustrate our results in simulation and via a reanalysis of the classic "eight schools" study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional problems have long been considered the Achilles' heel of Bayesian optimization algorithms. Spurred by the curse of dimensionality, a large collection of algorithms aim to make it more performant in this setting, commonly by imposing various simplifying assumptions on the objective. In this paper, we identify the degeneracies that make vanilla Bayesian optimization poorly suited to high-dimensional tasks, and further show how existing algorithms address these degeneracies through the lens of lowering the model complexity. Moreover, we propose an enhancement to the prior assumptions that are typical to vanilla Bayesian optimization algorithms, which reduces the complexity to manageable levels without imposing structural restrictions on the objective. Our modification - a simple scaling of the Gaussian process lengthscale prior with the dimensionality - reveals that standard Bayesian optimization works drastically better than previously thought in high dimensions, clearly outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple commonly considered real-world high-dimensional tasks.</description>

      <title>Iterated Denoising Energy Matching for Sampling from Boltzmann Densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently generating statistically independent samples from an unnormalized probability distribution, such as equilibrium samples of many-body systems, is a foundational problem in science. In this paper, we propose Iterated Denoising Energy Matching (iDEM), an iterative algorithm that uses a novel stochastic score matching objective leveraging solely the energy function and its gradient -- and no data samples -- to train a diffusion-based sampler. Specifically, iDEM alternates between (I) sampling regions of high model density from a diffusion-based sampler and (II) using these samples in our stochastic matching objective to further improve the sampler. iDEM is scalable to high dimensions as the inner matching objective, is simulation-free, and requires no MCMC samples. Moreover, by leveraging the fast mode mixing behavior of diffusion, iDEM smooths out the energy landscape enabling efficient exploration and learning of an amortized sampler. We evaluate iDEM on a suite of tasks ranging from standard synthetic energy functions to invariant $n$-body particle systems. We show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all metrics and trains $2-5\times$ faster, which allows it to be the first method to train using energy on the challenging $55$-particle Lennard-Jones system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for last layer retraining that aim to optimize worst-group accuracy (WGA) rely heavily on well-annotated groups in the training data. We show, both in theory and practice, that annotation-based data augmentations using either downsampling or upweighting for WGA are susceptible to domain annotation noise, and in high-noise regimes approach the WGA of a model trained with vanilla empirical risk minimization. We introduce Regularized Annotation of Domains (RAD) in order to train robust last layer classifiers without the need for explicit domain annotations. Our results show that RAD is competitive with other recently proposed domain annotation-free techniques. Most importantly, RAD outperforms state-of-the-art annotation-reliant methods even with only 5% noise in the training data for several publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>Robustly estimating heterogeneity in factorial data using Rashomon Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many statistical analyses, in both observational data and randomized control trials, ask: how does the outcome of interest vary with combinations of observable covariates? How do various drug combinations affect health outcomes, or how does technology adoption depend on incentives and demographics? Our goal is to partition this factorial space into "pools" of covariate combinations where the outcome differs across the pools (but not within a pool). Existing approaches (i) search for a single "optimal" partition under assumptions about the association between covariates or (ii) sample from the entire set of possible partitions. Both these approaches ignore the reality that, especially with correlation structure in covariates, many ways to partition the covariate space may be statistically indistinguishable, despite very different implications for policy or science. We develop an alternative perspective, called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). Each item in the RPS partitions the space of covariates using a tree-like geometry. RPSs incorporate all partitions that have posterior values near the maximum a posteriori partition, even if they offer substantively different explanations, and do so using a prior that makes no assumptions about associations between covariates. This prior is the $\ell_0$ prior, which we show is minimax optimal. Given the RPS we calculate the posterior of any measurable function of the feature effects vector on outcomes, conditional on being in the RPS. We also characterize approximation error relative to the entire posterior and provide bounds on the size of the RPS. Simulations demonstrate this framework allows for robust conclusions relative to conventional regularization techniques. We apply our method to three empirical settings: price effects on charitable giving, chromosomal structure (telomere length), and the introduction of microfinance.</description>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flows for Conformal Regression</title>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) algorithms estimate the uncertainty of a prediction model by calibrating its outputs on labeled data. The same calibration scheme usually applies to any model and data without modifications. The obtained prediction intervals are valid by construction but could be inefficient, i.e. unnecessarily big, if the prediction errors are not uniformly distributed over the input space.
  We present a general scheme to localize the intervals by training the calibration process. The standard prediction error is replaced by an optimized distance metric that depends explicitly on the object attributes. Learning the optimal metric is equivalent to training a Normalizing Flow that acts on the joint distribution of the errors and the inputs. Unlike the Error Reweighting CP algorithm of Papadopoulos et al. (2008), the framework allows estimating the gap between nominal and empirical conditional validity. The approach is compatible with existing locally-adaptive CP strategies based on re-weighting the calibration samples and applies to any point-prediction model without retraining.</description>

      <title>General Distribution Learning: A theoretical framework for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05666</link>

Abstract: There remain numerous unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL) within the classical learning theory framework. These include the remarkable generalization capabilities of overparametrized neural networks (NNs), the efficient optimization performance despite non-convexity of objectives, the mechanism of flat minima for generalization, and the exceptional performance of deep architectures in solving physical problems. This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD Learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression and parameter estimation. Departing from traditional statistical machine learning, GD Learning focuses on the true underlying distribution. In GD Learning, learning error, corresponding to the expected error in classical statistical learning framework, is divided into fitting errors due to models and algorithms, as well as sampling errors introduced by limited sampling data. The framework significantly incorporates prior knowledge, especially in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, thereby enhancing performance. Within the GD Learning framework, we demonstrate that the global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the non-uniformity of the eigenvalues of the model's Jacobian matrix. This insight leads to the development of the gradient structure control algorithm. GD Learning also offers fresh insights into the questions on deep learning, including overparameterization and non-convex optimization, bias-variance trade-off, and the mechanism of flat minima.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics for Signed Measures via a Bilevel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17054</link>

Abstract: Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MLFD) is a class of interacting particle methods that tackle convex optimization over probability measures on a manifold, which are scalable, versatile, and enjoy computational guarantees. However, some important problems -- such as risk minimization for infinite width two-layer neural networks, or sparse deconvolution -- are originally defined over the set of signed, rather than probability, measures. In this paper, we investigate how to extend the MFLD framework to convex optimization problems over signed measures. Among two known reductions from signed to probability measures -- the lifting and the bilevel approaches -- we show that the bilevel reduction leads to stronger guarantees and faster rates (at the price of a higher per-iteration complexity). In particular, we investigate the convergence rate of MFLD applied to the bilevel reduction in the low-noise regime and obtain two results. First, this dynamics is amenable to an annealing schedule, adapted from Suzuki et al. (2023), that results in improved convergence rates to a fixed multiplicative accuracy. Second, we investigate the problem of learning a single neuron with the bilevel approach and obtain local exponential convergence rates that depend polynomially on the dimension and noise level (to compare with the exponential dependence that would result from prior analyses).</description>
