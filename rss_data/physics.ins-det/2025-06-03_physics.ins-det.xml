      <title>Dark Matter Haloscope with a Disordered Dielectric Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>In-situ control of the resonant frequency of kinetic inductance detectors with multiplexed readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multiplexing factors are a primary advantage of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), but the implementation of high density arrays still presents significant challenges. Deviations between designed and achieved resonant frequencies are common, and differential loading and responsivity variation across an array may lead to dynamic inter-resonator interactions. It is therefore valuable to be able to both set and maintain the resonant frequency of a KID in situ, using the readout system. We show that it is possible to alter the resonant frequency of the devices by multiple linewidths through the application of readout current, and establish a new stable operational bias point at the driven frequency by making use of the hysteretic bistability commonly seen as bifurcation in frequency-domain measurements. We examine this interaction using a readout tone at fixed frequency positioned near or within the unbiased resonant bandwidth. Development of a control methodology based on this principle remains in an early stage, but a foundational step is understanding the interaction of the readout current with the resonator, in particular its influence on the resonant frequency. In this work, we study conventional KIDs with no physical isolation from the substrate, so we posit that the readout current primarily interacts with the resonator via non-thermal mechanisms, resulting in a predominantly reactive response. This behaviour is reproduced by a simple lumped-element circuit model of the resonance and readout system, providing a straightforward framework for analysis and interpretation. This demonstration is an important early step in the development of techniques which seek to dynamically alter the resonant frequencies of conventional KID arrays, and sets the stage for fast active resonant frequency control under operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Nanoelectrospray ionization coupled to a linear charge detection array ion trap spectrometer for single viral particles analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the implementation of a new charge detection mass spectrometer (CDMS) design that operates in a stand-alone mode, thanks to its integration with nanoelectrospray ionization. More specifically, this innovative CDMS consists of a linear charge detection array ion trap spectrometer that combines an eight-tube detector array with conical electrodes. This configuration allows for recording data in both transmission mode (linear array) and ion trapping mode (ConeArrayTrap), which enables the measurement of time-of-flight (related to the mass-to-charge ratio) along with the charge of individual ions. As a result, this design supports high-throughput metrology of viruses at the single-particle level. The devices and geometry of the instrument have been developed based on ion optics simulations. The performance of the current instrument is demonstrated using human norovirus-like particles (hNoVLP) and Adenovirus Ad(5) (hAdV5).</description>

      <title>A Low Power Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor Prototype for the STCF Inner Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) is a proposed e+e- collider with a peak luminosity 100 times higher than that of the present tau-charm factory. The inner tracker (ITK) of STCF should feature a low material budget and high readout speed. Under these requirements, the monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) is considered as a promising candidate for the ITK. To minimize the power consumption of MAPS (for low material budget), larger-size sensors are proposed to reduce the scale of the readout circuitry while preserving the required position resolution. Multiple sensors with varying dimensions and structures were designed and integrated in several prototype chips for performance comparison, fabricated in a 180~nm CIS process. The in-pixel readout circuit can also provide time of arrival (ToA) and time-over-threshold (ToT) of the hit signal, with a least significant bit (LSB) of 50 ns. The peripheral readout circuit performs operations including timestamp correction, data aggregation, caching, framing, 8b/10b encoding, and serialization. According to simulation, the power consumption for a full-scale chip is about 55.7 mW/cm2. Preliminary measurements have been conducted on the prototype chips.</description>

      <title>Two-colour balanced optical cross-correlator using fibre-coupled PPLN waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-colour fully fibre-coupled balanced optical cross-correlator (BOXC) based on sum-frequency generation (SFG) between 1560 nm and 800 nm laser pulses using waveguides implemented in type-0 phase-matched periodically poled LiNbO$_{3}$ (PPLN) crystals. The interaction has an effective nonlinear coefficient of $d_{eff}$ = 16.1 pm/V, many times higher than comparable nonlinear crystals used for this SFG interaction such as barium borate (BBO). The resulting sensitivity of the cross-correlator is measured to be 5.11 mV/fs, five times greater than current bulk-optic BOXCs after accounting for differences in transimpedance gain and photodetector responsivity, with the potential for significantly higher sensitivity after optimisations to the cross-correlator design.</description>

      <title>Flux Trapping Characterization for Superconducting Electronics Using a Cryogenic Widefield NV-Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping is a significant hurdle limiting reliability and scalability of superconducting electronics, yet tools for imaging flux vortices remain slow or insensitive. We present a cryogenic widefield NV-diamond magnetic microscope capable of rapid, micron-scale imaging of flux trapping in superconducting devices. Using this technique, we measure vortex expulsion fields in Nb thin films and patterned strips, revealing a crossover in expulsion behavior between $10$ and $20~\mu$m strip widths. The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Installation and performance of the 3rd Veto plane at the SND@LHC detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During 2022/2023 the optimal inefficiency of the Veto system of the SND@LHC detector was measured to be $(7.8\pm2.8)\times10^{-8}$. To reduce this inefficiency, a third Veto plane was installed during the 2023-2024 Year End Technical Stop. In addition, the Veto system was lowered to cover the target fully, thereby increasing acceptance. This paper describes how the inefficiency of the Veto system was reduced from $7.8\times10^{-8}$ with an acceptance of about $64\%$ of the target area in 2022-2023 to $(4.9\pm1.9)\times10^{-9}$ on the full area in 2024.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of Slowed Electron ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ Drift for PTOLEMY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10025v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To resolve the effective neutrino mass $m_\beta$ with an energy resolution of 50 meV, the PTOLEMY experiment has proposed a novel transverse electromagnetic filtering process. Perniciously reducing the kinetic energy of tritium $\beta$-decay electrons by counteracting motion from ${\bf E}$ $\times$ ${\bf B}$ and $\nabla{\rm B}$ drift, the PTOLEMY filter requires an input of emitted electron kinematic information to generate a tailored, suitable electric field for each endpoint candidate. The collaboration proposes to extract these quantities by using antennae to observe the relativistic frequency shift of emitted cyclotron radiation as an electron transits by ${\bf E}$ $\times$ ${\bf B}$ drift through a uniform magnetic field region preceding the filter. Electrons must be contained within this region long enough such that an adequate integrated radiated power signal is received to accurately estimate kinematics. This necessitates a controlled, slowed drift speed. However, a demonstration of slowing ${\bf E}$ $\times$ ${\bf B}$ drift for the purpose of increasing containment time has yet to be shown in a physical setup. Actualizing such a system is a crucial milestone in developing the detector, enabling future cyclotron radiation measurements, filter implementation, and source injection. This paper presents the experimental design to vary ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift speed of carbon-14 $\beta$-decay electrons using a custom electrode field cage situated between the pole faces of an electromagnet. Matching our results with high-fidelity simulation, we deduce a capacity to increase particle time of flight by a factor of 5 in the field cage's slow drift region. Limited only by the dimensions of our system, we assert drift speed can be arbitrarily slowed to meet the needs of PTOLEMY's future detector.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are easier to satisfy. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Muon Imaging for Illicit Cargo Detection: A Simulation-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the potential of muon tomography as a non-invasive technique for detecting concealed illicit drugs in cargo, based on detailed simulations performed using the GEANT4 toolkit. A combined analysis of muon scattering and absorption data was employed to enhance material discrimination, with a focus on realistic smuggling scenarios involving cocaine hidden within legitimate cargo. A two-stage inspection protocol is proposed to balance detection speed and resolution. In the first stage, a rapid scan lasting ~ 60 seconds is used to identify anomalous scattering and absorption rates, without requiring full tomographic reconstruction. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of rapid scan data revealed that the Random Forest classifier achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9969, while the multivariate normal likelihood model attained an AUC of 0.9977, both indicating excellent discrimination between benign cargo and smuggled contraband. Upon detection of anomalies, an extended scan ~30 minutes is initiated to enable high-resolution three-dimensional imaging for accurate localization and identification of hidden materials. Simulation results demonstrate that, with a detector spatial resolution of 1~mm (FWHM), concealed contraband such as cocaine can be detected with approximately 3 sigma statistical significance during the rapid scan phase. In extended scans, cocaine packages concealed within banana boxes were successfully visualized and automatically identified using clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN applied to the tomographic reconstruction. These findings confirm the feasibility of cosmic-ray muon tomography as a passive, safe, and effective approach for contraband detection in real-world cargo inspection applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve analysis performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>
