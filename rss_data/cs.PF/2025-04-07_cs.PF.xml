      <title>Enhancing Traffic Sign Recognition On The Performance Based On Yolov8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper Traffic sign recognition plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Despite significant advances in deep learning and object detection, accurately detecting and classifying traffic signs remains challenging due to their small sizes, variable environmental conditions, occlusion, and class imbalance. This thesis presents an enhanced YOLOv8-based detection system that integrates advanced data augmentation techniques, novel architectural enhancements including Coordinate Attention (CA), Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN), and dynamic modules such as ODConv and LSKA, along with refined loss functions (EIoU and WIoU combined with Focal Loss). Extensive experiments conducted on datasets including GTSRB, TT100K, and GTSDB demonstrate marked improvements in detection accuracy, robustness under adverse conditions, and real-time inference on edge devices. The findings contribute actionable insights for deploying reliable traffic sign recognition systems in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>NeRFlex: Resource-aware Real-time High-quality Rendering of Complex Scenes on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a cutting-edge neural network-based technique for novel view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. However, its significant computational demands pose challenges for deployment on mobile devices. While mesh-based NeRF solutions have shown potential in achieving real-time rendering on mobile platforms, they often fail to deliver high-quality reconstructions when rendering practical complex scenes. Additionally, the non-negligible memory overhead caused by pre-computed intermediate results complicates their practical application. To overcome these challenges, we present NeRFlex, a resource-aware, high-resolution, real-time rendering framework for complex scenes on mobile devices. NeRFlex integrates mobile NeRF rendering with multi-NeRF representations that decompose a scene into multiple sub-scenes, each represented by an individual NeRF network. Crucially, NeRFlex considers both memory and computation constraints as first-class citizens and redesigns the reconstruction process accordingly. NeRFlex first designs a detail-oriented segmentation module to identify sub-scenes with high-frequency details. For each NeRF network, a lightweight profiler, built on domain knowledge, is used to accurately map configurations to visual quality and memory usage. Based on these insights and the resource constraints on mobile devices, NeRFlex presents a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently determine configurations for all NeRF representations, despite the NP-hardness of the original decision problem. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets and mobile devices demonstrate that NeRFlex achieves real-time, high-quality rendering on commercial mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of HPC applications on the Aurora Supercomputer: Exploring the Impact of HBM-Enabled Intel Xeon Max CPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aurora supercomputer is an exascale-class system designed to tackle some of the most demanding computational workloads. Equipped with both High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR memory, it provides unique trade-offs in performance, latency, and capacity. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the memory systems on the Aurora supercomputer, with a focus on evaluating the trade-offs between HBM and DDR memory systems. We explore how different memory configurations, including memory modes (Flat and Cache) and clustering modes (Quad and SNC4), influence key system performance metrics such as memory bandwidth, latency, CPU-GPU PCIe bandwidth, and MPI communication bandwidth. Additionally, we examine the performance of three representative HPC applications -- HACC, QMCPACK, and BFS -- each illustrating the impact of memory configurations on performance. By using microbenchmarks and application-level analysis, we provide insights into how to select the optimal memory system and configuration to maximize performance based on the application characteristics. The findings presented in this paper offer guidance for users of the Aurora system and similar exascale systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Modeling of Data Storage Systems using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision modeling of systems is one of the main areas of industrial data analysis. Models of systems, their digital twins, are used to predict their behavior under various conditions. We have developed several models of a storage system using machine learning-based generative models. The system consists of several components: hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) storage pools with different RAID schemes and cache. Each storage component is represented by a probabilistic model that describes the probability distribution of the component performance in terms of IOPS and latency, depending on their configuration and external data load parameters. The results of the experiments demonstrate the errors of 4-10 % for IOPS and 3-16 % for latency predictions depending on the components and models of the system. The predictions show up to 0.99 Pearson correlation with Little's law, which can be used for unsupervised reliability checks of the models. In addition, we present novel data sets that can be used for benchmarking regression algorithms, conditional generative models, and uncertainty estimation methods in machine learning.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Understanding Performances of Two-Class Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properly understanding the performances of classifiers is essential in various scenarios. However, the literature often relies only on one or two standard scores to compare classifiers, which fails to capture the nuances of application-specific requirements. The Tile is a recently introduced visualization tool organizing an infinity of ranking scores into a 2D map. Thanks to the Tile, it is now possible to compare classifiers efficiently, displaying all possible application-specific preferences instead of having to rely on a pair of scores. This hitchhiker's guide to understanding the performances of two-class classifiers presents four scenarios showcasing different user profiles: a theoretical analyst, a method designer, a benchmarker, and an application developer. We introduce several interpretative flavors adapted to the user's needs by mapping different values on the Tile. We illustrate this guide by ranking and analyzing the performances of 74 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models through the perspective of the four scenarios. Through these user profiles, we demonstrate that the Tile effectively captures the behavior of classifiers in a single visualization, while accommodating an infinite number of ranking scores. Code for mapping the different Tile flavors is available in supplementary material.</description>
