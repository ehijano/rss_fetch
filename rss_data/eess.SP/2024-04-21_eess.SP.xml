      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-aided Transmission Design for Energy-efficient Link Optimization in Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for transmission design to optimize the energy efficiency in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links. Considering the dynamic environment of vehicular communications, the optimization problem is non-convex and mathematically difficult to solve. Hence, we propose scenario identification-based double and Dueling deep Q-Network (SI-D3QN), a DRL algorithm integrating both double deep Q-Network and Dueling deep Q-Network, for the joint design of modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection and power control. To be more specific, we employ SI techique to enhance link performance and assit the D3QN agent in refining its decision-making processes. The experiment results demonstrate that, across various optimization tasks, our proposed SI-D3QN agent outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the valid actions and link performance metrics. Particularly, while ensuring significant improvement in energy efficiency, the agent facilitates a 29.6% enhancement in the link throughput under the same energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Spreading Code Optimization for Low-Earth Orbit Satellites via Mixed-Integer Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the correlation properties of spreading codes is critical for minimizing inter-channel interference in satellite navigation systems. By improving the codes' correlation sidelobes, we can enhance navigation performance while minimizing the required spreading code lengths. In the case of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite navigation, shorter code lengths (on the order of a hundred) are preferred due to their ability to achieve fast signal acquisition. Additionally, the relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in LEO systems reduces the need for longer spreading codes to mitigate inter-channel interference. In this work, we propose a two-stage block coordinate descent (BCD) method which optimizes the codes' correlation properties while enforcing the autocorrelation sidelobe zero (ACZ) property. In each iteration of the BCD method, we solve a mixed-integer convex program (MICP) over a block of 25 binary variables. Our method is applicable to spreading code families of arbitrary sizes and lengths, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for a problem with 66 length-127 codes and a problem with 130 length-257 codes.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication enabled Multiple Base Stations Cooperative UAV Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) exhibits notable potential for sensing the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), facilitating real-time monitoring of UAVs for security insurance. Due to the low sensing accuracy of single base stations (BSs), a cooperative UAV sensing method by multi-BS is proposed in this paper to achieve high-accuracy sensing. Specifically, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based symbol-level fusion method is proposed for UAV localization and velocity estimation, consisting of a single-BS preprocessing step and a lattice points searching step. The preprocessing procedure enhances the single-BS accuracy by superposing multiple spectral functions, thereby establishing a reference value for subsequent lattice points searching. Furthermore, the lattice point with minimal error compared to the preprocessing results is determined as the fusion result. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed symbol-level fusion method outperforms the benchmarking methods in localization and velocity estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-centric cell-free (UCCF) wireless networks have a range of distinguished characteristics, which can be exploited for meeting some challenges that the conventional cellular systems are hard to. This chapter is devoted to delivering the fundamentals of wireless communications in UCCF systems, including channel modeling and estimation, uplink (UL) detection, downlink (DL) transmission, and resource optimization. Specifically, the advantages of cell-free networking are examined in contrast to the conventional celluar systems. The global and location-aware distributed UL detection are explored in the principles of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and brief propagation. Correspondingly, the global and distributed DL transmission schemes are designed based on the MMSE precoding. The optimization of both UL and DL is analyzed with respect to system design and resource-allocation. Furthermore, some challenges for the implementation of UCCF systems in practice are identified and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Training Design for Over-the-Air Polynomial Power Amplifier Model Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current evolution towards a massive number of antennas and a large variety of transceiver architectures forces to revisit the conventional techniques used to improve the fundamental power amplifier (PA) linearity-efficiency trade-off. Most of the digital linearization techniques rely on PA measurements using a dedicated feedback receiver. However, in modern systems with large amount of RF chains and high carrier frequency, dedicated receiver per RF chain is costly and complex to implement. This issue can be addressed by measuring PAs over the air, but in that case, this extra signalling is sharing resources with the actual data transmission. In this paper, we look at the problem from an estimation theory point of view so as to minimize pilot overhead while optimizing estimation performance. We show that conventional results in the mathematical statistics community can be used. We find the least squares (LS) optimal training design, minimizing the maximal mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed PA response over its whole input range. As compared to uniform training, simulations demonstrate a factor 10 reduction of the maximal MSE for a L = 7 PA polynomial order. Using prior information, the LMMSE estimator can achieve an additional gain of a factor up to 300 at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Authentication Using Information Reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User authentication in future wireless communication networks is expected to become more complicated due to their large scale and heterogeneity. Furthermore, the computational complexity of classical cryptographic approaches based on public key distribution can be a limiting factor for using in simple, low-end Internet of things (IoT) devices. This paper proposes physical layer authentication (PLA) expected to complement existing traditional approaches, e.g., in multi-factor authentication protocols. The precision and consistency of PLA is impacted because of random variations of wireless channel realizations between different time slots, which can impair authentication performance. In order to address this, a method based on error-correcting codes in the form of reconciliation is considered in this work. In particular, we adopt distributed source coding (Slepian-Wolf) reconciliation using polar codes to reconcile channel measurements spread in time. Hypothesis testing is then applied to the reconciled vectors to accept or reject the device as authenticated. Simulation results show that the proposed PLA using reconciliation outperforms prior schemes even in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Offloading Optimization in MEC and Vehicular-Fog Systems: A Distributed-TD3 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 5G networks has enabled the deployment of a two-tier edge and vehicular-fog network. It comprises Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Vehicular-Fogs (VFs), strategically positioned closer to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, reducing propagation latency compared to cloud-based solutions and ensuring satisfactory quality of service (QoS). However, during high-traffic events like concerts or athletic contests, MEC sites may face congestion and become overloaded. Utilizing offloading techniques, we can transfer computationally intensive tasks from resource-constrained devices to those with sufficient capacity, for accelerating tasks and extending device battery life. In this research, we consider offloading within a two-tier MEC and VF architecture, involving offloading from MEC to MEC and from MEC to VF. The primary objective is to minimize the average system cost, considering both latency and energy consumption. To achieve this goal, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing latency and energy while considering given resource constraints. To facilitate decision-making for nearly optimal computational offloading, we design an equivalent reinforcement learning environment that accurately represents the network architecture and the formulated problem. To accomplish this, we propose a Distributed-TD3 (DTD3) approach, which builds on the TD3 algorithm. Extensive simulations, demonstrate that our strategy achieves faster convergence and higher efficiency compared to other benchmark solutions.</description>

      <title>Transmitter Side Beyond-Diagonal RIS for mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work initiates the study of a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-aided transmitter architecture for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. Deploying BD-RIS at the transmitter side not only alleviates the need for extensive fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains but also enhances both communication and sensing performance. These benefits are facilitated by the additional design flexibility introduced by the fully-connected scattering matrix of BD-RIS. To achieve the aforementioned benefits, in this work, we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to design the digital beamforming of the transmitter and the scattering matrix of the BD-RIS with the aim of jointly maximizing the sum rate for multiple communication users and minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multiple sensing targets. Numerical results show that the transmitter-side BD-RIS-aided mmWave ISAC outperforms the conventional diagonal-RIS-aided ones in both communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Approach to the Parameter Estimation Problem for One-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel algorithm for estimating parameters in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The algorithm takes advantage of the Hankel structure inherent in the Fourier data obtained from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples of the mixture. For GMMs with a unified variance, a singular value ratio functional using the Fourier data is introduced and used to resolve the variance and component number simultaneously. The consistency of the estimator is derived. Compared to classic algorithms such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method, the proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of Gaussian components or good initial guesses. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in estimation accuracy and computational cost. Second, we reveal that there exists a fundamental limit to the problem of estimating the number of Gaussian components or model order in the mixture model if the number of i.i.d samples is finite. For the case of a single variance, we show that the model order can be successfully estimated only if the minimum separation distance between the component means exceeds a certain threshold value and can fail if below. We derive a lower bound for this threshold value, referred to as the computational resolution limit, in terms of the number of i.i.d samples, the variance, and the number of Gaussian components. Numerical experiments confirm this phase transition phenomenon in estimating the model order. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better scores in likelihood, AIC, and BIC when compared to the EM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis of a two-section InP laser as an all-optical spiking neuron: dependency on control and design parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a rate-equation model we numerically evaluate the carrier concentration and photon number in an integrated two-section semiconductor laser, and analyse its dynamics in three-dimensional phase space. The simulation comprises compact model descriptions extracted from a commercially-available generic InP technology platform, allowing us to model an applied reverse-bias voltage to the saturable absorber. We use the model to study the influence of the injected gain current, reverse-bias voltage, and cavity mirror reflectivity on the excitable operation state, which is the operation mode desired for the laser to act as an all-optical integrated neuron. We show in phase-space that our model is capable of demonstrating four different operation modes, i.e. cw, self-pulsating and an on-set and excitable mode under optical pulse injection. In addition, we show that lowering the reflectivity of one of the cavity mirrors greatly enhances the control parameter space for excitable operation, enabling more relaxed operation parameter control and lower power consumption of an integrated two-section laser neuron.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Local CSI in Cell-Free Networks with Channel Aging and Fronthaul Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that downlink cell-free networks perform best under centralized implementations where the local channel state information (CSI) acquired by the access-points (AP) is forwarded to one or more central processing units (CPU) for the computation of the joint precoders based on global CSI. However, mostly due to limited fronthaul capabilities, this procedure incurs some delay that may lead to partially outdated precoding decisions and hence performance degradation. In some scenarios, this may even lead to worse performance than distributed implementations where the precoders are locally computed by the APs based on partial yet timely local CSI. To address this issue, this study considers the problem of robust precoding design merging the benefits of timely local CSI and delayed global CSI. As main result, we provide a novel distributed precoding design based on the recently proposed team minimum mean-square error method. As a byproduct, we also obtain novel insights related to the AP-CPU functional split problem. Our main conclusion, corroborated by simulations, is that the opportunity of performing some local precoding computations at the APs should not be neglected, even in centralized implementations.</description>

      <title>Open Datasets for AI-Enabled Radio Resource Control in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By effectively implementing the strategies for resource allocation, the capabilities, and reliability of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) can be enhanced. This leads to enhance spectrum utilization performance while minimizing the unmet system capacity, meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements and overall system optimization. In turn, a wide range of applications and services in various domains can be supported. However, allocating resources in a multi-constellation system with heterogeneous satellite links and highly dynamic user traffic demand pose challenges in ensuring sufficient and fair resource distribution. To mitigate these complexities and minimize the overhead, there is a growing shift towards utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for its ability to handle such problems effectively. This calls for the development of an intelligent decision-making controller using AI to efficiently manage resources in this complex environment. In this context, real-world open datasets play a pivotal role in the development of AI models addressing radio control optimization problems. As a matter of fact, acquiring suitable datasets can be arduous. Therefore, this paper identifies pertinent real-world open datasets representing realistic traffic pattern, network performances and demand for fixed and dynamic user terminals, enabling a variety of uses cases. The aim of gathering and publishing the information of these datasets are to inspire and assist the research community in crafting the advance resource management solutions. In a nutshell, this paper establishes a solid foundation of commercially accessible data, with the potential to set benchmarks and accelerate the resolution of resource allocation optimization challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1811.09315v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disappearance of flight MH370 is possibly the greatest mystery in aviation history. A large zone in the Southern Indian Ocean was searched unsuccessfully leaving an open case and an unacceptable situation for the family members. We discuss the scientific difficulties with locating the plane through satellite data and develop an improved analysis using least square curve fitting of analytical non-Euclidean route equations providing robust topology-optimization with perturbation theory handling satellite movement. We find four independent solutions with the final part of the flight following a great circle. Two are located in stable minima for the error-function, and two unstable ones agree poorly with most data. One stable solution coincides with the Inmarsat-result, but fails to explain additional data. Our best solution leads to an entirely different location agreeing with other data from debris, acoustics, an eyewitness report, the received microwave power, several contrails, two seismic detectors at Christmas Island, and with a mushroom impact cloud providing the final proof where to find the rest of the airplane and the black boxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering elements of a low-dimensional model from under-determined linear measurements. To perform recovery, we consider the minimization of a convex regularizer subject to a data fit constraint. Given a model, we ask ourselves what is the "best" convex regularizer to perform its recovery. To answer this question, we define an optimal regularizer as a function that maximizes a compliance measure with respect to the model. We introduce and study several notions of compliance. We give analytical expressions for compliance measures based on the best-known recovery guarantees with the restricted isometry property. These expressions permit to show the optimality of the ${\ell}$1-norm for sparse recovery and of the nuclear norm for low-rank matrix recovery for these compliance measures.  We also investigate the construction of an optimal convex regularizer using the examples of sparsity in levels and of  sparse plus low-rank models.</description>

      <title>Companding and Predistortion Techniques for Improved Efficiency and Performance in SWIPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze how the use of companding techniques, together with digital predistortion (DPD), can be leveraged to improve system efficiency and performance in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems based on power splitting. By taking advantage of the benefits of each of these well-known techniques to mitigate non-linear effects due to power amplifier (PA) and energy harvesting (EH) operation, we illustrate how DPD and companding can be effectively combined to improve the EH efficiency while keeping unalterable the information transfer performance. We establish design criteria that allow the PA to operate in a higher efficiency region so that the reduction in peak-to-average power ratio over the transmitted signal is translated into an increase in the average radiated power and EH efficiency. The performance of DPD and companding techniques is evaluated in a number of scenarios, showing that a combination of both techniques allows to significantly increase the power transfer efficiency in SWIPT systems.</description>

      <title>A multi-modal approach for identifying schizophrenia using cross-modal attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on how different modalities of human communication can be used to distinguish between healthy controls and subjects with schizophrenia who exhibit strong positive symptoms. We developed a multi-modal schizophrenia classification system using audio, video, and text. Facial action units and vocal tract variables were extracted as low-level features from video and audio respectively, which were then used to compute high-level coordination features that served as the inputs to the audio and video modalities. Context-independent text embeddings extracted from transcriptions of speech were used as the input for the text modality. The multi-modal system is developed by fusing a segment-to-session-level classifier for video and audio modalities with a text model based on a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) with cross-modal attention. The proposed multi-modal system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art multi-modal system by 8.53% in the weighted average F1 score.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication Signal Processing Based on Compressed Sensing Over Unlicensed Spectrum Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising key technology of 6th generation (6G) mobile communication system, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology aims to make full use of spectrum resources to enable the functional integration of communication and sensing. The ISAC-enabled mobile communication system regularly operate in non-continuous spectrum bands due to crowded licensed frequency bands. However, the conventional sensing algorithms over non-continuous spectrum bands have disadvantages such as reduced peak-to-side lobe ratio (PSLR) and degraded anti-noise performance. Facing this challenge, we propose a high-precision ISAC signal processing algorithm based on compressed sensing (CS) in this paper. By integrating the resource block group (RBG) configuration information in 5th generation new radio (5G NR) and channel information matrices, we can dynamically and accurately obtain power estimation spectra. Moreover, we employ the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) to address the reconstruction problem and utilize K-fold cross validation (KCV) to obtain optimal parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has lower sidelobes or even zero sidelobes compared with conventional sensing algorithms. Meanwhile, compared with the improved 2D FFT algorithm and conventional 2D FFT algorithm, the proposed algorithms in this paper have a maximum improvement of 54.66 % and 84.36 % in range estimation accuracy, and 41.54 % and 97.09 % in velocity estimation accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Blind Federated Learning via Over-the-Air q-QAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate federated edge learning over a fading multiple access channel. To alleviate the communication burden between the edge devices and the access point, we introduce a pioneering digital over-the-air computation strategy employing q-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, culminating in a low latency communication scheme. Indeed, we propose a new federated edge learning framework in which edge devices use digital modulation for over-the-air uplink transmission to the edge server while they have no access to the channel state information. Furthermore, we incorporate multiple antennas at the edge server to overcome the fading inherent in wireless communication. We analyze the number of antennas required to mitigate the fading impact effectively. We prove a non-asymptotic upper bound for the mean squared error for the proposed federated learning with digital over-the-air uplink transmissions under both noisy and fading conditions. Leveraging the derived upper bound, we characterize the convergence rate of the learning process of a non-convex loss function in terms of the mean square error of gradients due to the fading channel. Furthermore, we substantiate the theoretical assurances through numerical experiments concerning mean square error and the convergence efficacy of the digital federated edge learning framework. Notably, the results demonstrate that augmenting the number of antennas at the edge server and adopting higher-order modulations improve the model accuracy up to 60\%.</description>

      <title>UL-DL duality for cell-free massive MIMO with per-AP power and information constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06520v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel uplink-downlink duality principle for optimal joint precoding design under per-transmitter power and information constraints in fading channels. The information constraints model limited sharing of channel state information and data bearing signals across the transmitters. The main application is to cell-free networks, where each access point (AP) must typically satisfy an individual power constraint and form its transmit signal using limited cooperation capabilities. Our duality principle applies to ergodic achievable rates given by the popular hardening bound, and it can be interpreted as a nontrivial generalization of a previous result by Yu and Lan for deterministic channels. This generalization allows us to study involved information constraints going beyond the simple case of cluster-wise centralized precoding covered by previous techniques. Specifically, we show that the optimal joint precoders are, in general, given by an extension of the recently developed team minimum mean-square error method. As a particular yet practical example, we then solve the problem of optimal local precoding design in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO networks subject to per-AP power constraints.</description>

      <title>Inverse Cubature and Quadrature Kalman filters</title>

Abstract: Recent research in inverse cognition with cognitive radar has led to the development of inverse stochastic filters that are employed by the target to infer the information the cognitive radar may have learned. Prior works addressed this inverse cognition problem by proposing inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) and inverse extended KF (I-EKF), respectively, for linear and non-linear Gaussian state-space models. However, in practice, many counter-adversarial settings involve highly non-linear system models, wherein EKF's linearization often fails. In this paper, we consider the efficient numerical integration techniques to address such non-linearities and, to this end, develop inverse cubature KF (I-CKF), inverse quadrature KF (I-QKF), and inverse cubature-quadrature KF (I-CQKF). For the unknown system model case, we develop reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based CKF. We derive the stochastic stability conditions for the proposed filters in the exponential-mean-squared-boundedness sense and prove the filters' consistency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the estimation accuracy of our I-CKF, I-QKF, and I-CQKF with the recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Aware Masked Autoencoders for Multimodal Pretraining on Biosignals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from biosignals is vital for building a comprehensive representation of people's physical and mental states. However, multimodal biosignals often exhibit substantial distributional shifts between pretraining and inference datasets, stemming from changes in task specification or variations in modality compositions. To achieve effective pretraining in the presence of potential distributional shifts, we propose a frequency-aware masked autoencoder ($\texttt{bio}$FAME) that learns to parameterize the representation of biosignals in the frequency space. $\texttt{bio}$FAME incorporates a frequency-aware transformer, which leverages a fixed-size Fourier-based operator for global token mixing, independent of the length and sampling rate of inputs. To maintain the frequency components within each input channel, we further employ a frequency-maintain pretraining strategy that performs masked autoencoding in the latent space. The resulting architecture effectively utilizes multimodal information during pretraining, and can be seamlessly adapted to diverse tasks and modalities at test time, regardless of input size and order. We evaluated our approach on a diverse set of transfer experiments on unimodal time series, achieving an average of $\uparrow$5.5% improvement in classification accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our architecture is robust in modality mismatch scenarios, including unpredicted modality dropout or substitution, proving its practical utility in real-world applications.

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and the measurement of a periodic metasurface that performs anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a parasitic direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the behaviour, in terms of RCS, of such a metasurface. This work will therefore focus the discussion on fabrication and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. The measurement results are extensively discussed as well, enlightening some limitations in the context of metasurface RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface indeed performs the anticipated reduction of the RCS level in the considered Floquet direction. The well-agreeing simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-dense cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology expected to meet the future ubiquitous connectivity requirements and ever-growing data traffic demands in 6G. This article provides a contemporary overview of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO networks, and addresses important unresolved questions on their future deployment. We first present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art research on CF-MMIMO and ultra-dense networks. Then, we discuss the key challenges of CF-MMIMO under ultra-dense scenarios such as low-complexity architecture and processing, low-complexity/scalable resource allocation, fronthaul limitation, massive access, synchronization, and channel acquisition. Finally, we answer key open questions, considering different design comparisons and discussing suitable methods dealing with the key challenges of ultra-dense CF-MMIMO. The discussion aims to provide a valuable roadmap for interesting future research directions in this area, facilitating the development of CF-MMIMO MIMO for 6G.</description>

      <title>EMF Exposure Mitigation via MAC Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: International standards bodies define Electromagnetic field (EMF) emission requirements that can be translated into control of the base station actual Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), i.e., averaged over a sliding time window. In this work we show how to comply with such requirements by designing a water-filling power allocation method operating at the MAC scheduler level. Our method ensures throughput fairness across users while constraining the EIRP to a value that is produced by an outer-loop procedure which is not the focus of our paper. The low computational complexity of our technique is appealing given the tight computational requirements of the MAC scheduler. Our proposal is evaluated against the prior art approaches through massive-MIMO system level simulations that include realistic modeling of physical and MAC level cellular procedures. We conclude that our proposal effectively mitigates EMF exposure with considerably less impact on network performance, making it a standout candidate for 5G and future 6G MAC scheduler implementations.</description>
