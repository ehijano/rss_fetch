      <title>A Deep Learning Earth System Model for Stable and Efficient Simulation of the Current Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for computationally intensive state-of-the-art Earth-system models is to distinguish global warming signals from interannual variability. Recently machine learning models have performed better than state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models for medium-range forecasting. Here we introduce DLESyM, a parsimonious deep learning model that accurately simulates the Earth's current climate over 1000-year periods with negligible drift. DLESyM simulations equal or exceed key metrics of seasonal and interannual variability--such as tropical cyclone genesis and intensity, and mid-latitude blocking frequency--for historical simulations from four leading models from the 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project. DLESyM, trained on both historical reanalysis data and satellite observations, is a key step toward an accurate highly efficient model of the coupled Earth system, empowering long-range sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasts.</description>

      <title>GPTCast: a weather language model for precipitation nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces GPTCast, a generative deep-learning method for ensemble nowcast of radar-based precipitation, inspired by advancements in large language models (LLMs). We employ a GPT model as a forecaster to learn spatiotemporal precipitation dynamics using tokenized radar images. The tokenizer is based on a Quantized Variational Autoencoder featuring a novel reconstruction loss tailored for the skewed distribution of precipitation that promotes faithful reconstruction of high rainfall rates. The approach produces realistic ensemble forecasts and provides probabilistic outputs with accurate uncertainty estimation. The model is trained without resorting to randomness, all variability is learned solely from the data and exposed by model at inference for ensemble generation. We train and test GPTCast using a 6-year radar dataset over the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy, showing superior results compared to state-of-the-art ensemble extrapolation methods.</description>
