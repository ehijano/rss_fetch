      <title>Identification of a Kalman filter: consistency of local solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction error and maximum likelihood methods are powerful tools for identifying linear dynamical systems and, in particular, enable the joint estimation of model parameters and the Kalman filter used for state estimation. A key limitation, however, is that these methods require solving a generally non-convex optimization problem to global optimality. This paper analyzes the statistical behavior of local minimizers in the special case where only the Kalman gain is estimated. We prove that these local solutions are statistically consistent estimates of the true Kalman gain. This follows from asymptotic unimodularity: as the dataset grows, the objective function converges to a limit with a unique local (and therefore global) minimizer. We further provide guidelines for designing the optimization problem for Kalman filter tuning and discuss extensions to the joint estimation of additional linear parameters and noise covariances. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of increasing complexity. The main practical takeaway of this paper is that difficulties caused by local minimizers in system identification are, at least, not attributable to the tuning of the Kalman gain.</description>

      <title>Definition and Formulation of Inertia Service Incorporating Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing concerns over the scarcity of inertia have motivated the procurement of inertia as an ancillary service (AS). Despite numerous academic and practical efforts, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and treatment of inertia service in market operations, particularly the specification of inertia variables and the separation between synchronous inertia (SI) from synchronous generators and virtual inertia (VI) from inverter-based resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a power-oriented (P-oriented) definition based on inertial response, which establishes conceptual consistency between SI and VI and makes the inertia service commensurable with other ASs. This definition explicitly incorporates both positive and negative inertial responses during frequency drop events. We then formulate a security-constrained economic dispatch framework based on this P-oriented definition and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through simulations. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed bidirectional service definition ensures price signals that reflect the economic value of inertial provision.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Valued Passivity Indices: Foundations, Properties, and Stability Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passivity index, a quantitative measure of a system's passivity deficiency or excess, has been widely used in stability analysis and control. Existing studies mostly rely on scalar forms of indices, which are restrictive for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems. This paper extends the classical scalar indices to a systematic matrix-valued framework, referred to as passivity matrices. A broad range of classical results in passivity theory can be naturally generalized in this framework. We first show that, under the matrix representation, passivity indices essentially correspond to the curvature of the dissipativity functional under a second-variation interpretation. This result reveals that the intrinsic geometric structure of passivity consists of its directions and intensities, which a scalar index cannot fully capture. For linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, we examine the structural properties of passivity matrices with respect to the Loewner partial order and propose two principled criteria for selecting representative matrices. Compared with conventional scalar indices, the matrix-valued indices capture the passivity coupling among different input-output channels in MIMO systems and provide a more comprehensive description of system passivity. This richer information leads to lower passivation effort and less conservative stability assessment.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable 6G: A Holistic View of Trade-offs and Enablers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) can play a central role in shaping a sustainable future, the most compelling contemporary challenge. Connecting the unconnected, reducing carbon emissions of vertical sectors, and allowing heterogeneous types of intelligence (including humans) to safely and constructively interact in complex environments, are only a few of the several challenges that can be supported by 6G. However, this requires a careful design that balances positive and negative impacts of 6G, towards a sustainable and sustainability-enabling technology. This paper presents a holistic view that translates the complex interplay between the 6G enabling effects and the sustainability of 6G by design, into concrete trade-offs and research questions. Starting from today's challenges for society and associated key values, we unfold the dilemma into a set of technical trade-offs, whose solutions span from technological innovations to standardization actions towards applicability.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning Beyond Baseline Control: A Hierarchical Framework for Space Triangle Tethered Formation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangular tethered formation system (TTFS) provide a promising platform for deep space exploration and distributed sensing due to its intrinsic spatial-orientation stability and capability of adjusting distances among node satellites through deployment and retrieval of tethers. However, due to the coupled tether-satellite dynamics and disturbance sensitivity of TTFS, traditional control methods struggle to achieve a balanced trade-off among configuration accuracy requirements, tension constraints, and energy efficiency consumption throughout the deployment process.In this paper, a novel model-reference reinforcement learning control framework is proposed for TTFS. By integrating baseline model-based control with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) compensator, the proposed method simultaneously achieves high-precision tracking, fuel efficiency, and compliance with tension limits. A hierarchical training scheme is developed to address the convergence difficulties arising from strongly coupled states in centralized training, while tailored reward functions, reset conditions, and normalization criteria are designed to accelerate training convergence. Closed-loop stability of the overall control law is rigorously proven using Lyapunov methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller reduces steady-state tracking errors by over 96% for tethers and 99% for node satellites, while cutting fuel consumption by two orders of magnitude compared with the baseline method. These results validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach for TTFS deployment control.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dispatch Decisions on Small-Signal Stability of Converter-Dominated Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-signal stability of modern converter-dominated power systems has been the subject of extensive research, particularly from the perspective of device-level control design for grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) converters. However, the influence of power flow variables on system stability has received limited attention. Conventional small-signal stability analyses are typically conducted at a specific operating point, emphasizing the selection of control or system design parameters while neglecting the sensitivity of stability characteristics to operating conditions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by systematically investigating the impact of dispatch decisions on the small-signal stability of converter-based power systems. Our findings are first illustrated on a three-bus system and then validated on the standard IEEE 39-bus test system to demonstrate scalability. Across the test systems, we find that high-voltage capacitive operation of GFL converters limits its active power injection, whereas inductive operation permits higher injections, and it is generally preferable for the GFM converter to supply more active power.</description>

      <title>Online Bayesian Learning of Agent Behavior in Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an online Bayesian game-theoretic method for behavior identification in multi-agent dynamical systems. By casting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman optimality conditions as linear-in-parameter residuals, the method enables fast sequential Bayesian updates, uncertainty-aware inference, and robust prediction from limited, noisy data-without history stacks. The approach accommodates nonlinear dynamics and nonquadratic value functions through basis expansions, providing flexible models. Experiments, including linear-quadratic and nonlinear shared-control scenarios, demonstrate accurate prediction with quantified uncertainty, highlighting the method's relevance for adaptive interaction and real-time decision making.</description>

      <title>Predictive Controlled Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to algorithmic composition, called predictive controlled music (PCM), which combines model predictive control (MPC) with music generation. PCM uses dynamic models to predict and optimize the music generation process, where musical notes are computed in a manner similar to an MPC problem by optimizing a performance measure. A feedforward neural network-based assessment function is used to evaluate the generated musical score, which serves as the objective function of the PCM optimization problem. Furthermore, a recurrent neural network model is employed to capture the relationships among the variables in the musical notes, and this model is then used to define the constraints in the PCM. Similar to MPC, the proposed PCM computes musical notes in a receding-horizon manner, leading to feedback controlled prediction. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the PCM generation method.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive graphene-based electro-optic sensors for optically-multiplexed neural recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $\mu$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced-FQL($\lambda$), an Efficient and Interpretable RL with novel Fuzzy Eligibility Traces and Segmented Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($\lambda$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($\lambda$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($\lambda$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.</description>

      <title>CircuitLM: A Multi-Agent LLM-Aided Design Framework for Generating Circuit Schematics from Natural Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating accurate circuit schematics from high-level natural language descriptions remains a persistent challenge in electronics design, as large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate in granular details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs. We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>ZIVR: An Incremental Variance Reduction Technique For Zeroth-Order Composite Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates zeroth-order (ZO) finite-sum composite optimization. Recently, variance reduction techniques have been applied to ZO methods to mitigate the non-vanishing variance of 2-point estimators in constrained/composite optimization, yielding improved convergence rates. However, existing ZO variance reduction methods typically involve batch sampling of size at least $\Theta(n)$ or $\Theta(d)$, which can be computationally prohibitive for large-scale problems. In this work, we propose a general variance reduction framework, Zeroth-Order Incremental Variance Reduction (ZIVR), which supports flexible implementations$\unicode{x2014}$including a pure 2-point zeroth-order algorithm that eliminates the need for large batch sampling. Furthermore, we establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for ZIVR across strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex settings that match their first-order counterparts. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Driver-Intention Prediction with Deep Learning: Real-Time Brain-to-Vehicle Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Hybrid Approach for Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in hybrid data-driven predictive control: the effect of measurement noise on Hankel matrices. While noise is handled in direct and indirect methods, hybrid approaches often overlook its impact during trajectory estimation. We propose a Noise-Tolerant Data-Driven Predictive Control (NTDPC) framework that integrates singular value decomposition to separate system dynamics from noise within reduced-order Hankel matrices. This enables accurate prediction with shorter data horizons and lower computational effort. A sensitivity index is introduced to support horizon selection under different noise levels. Simulation results indicate improved robustness and efficiency compared to existing hybrid methods.</description>

      <title>An Improved Dual-Attention Transformer-LSTM for Small-Sample Prediction of Modal Frequency and Actual Anchor Radius in Micro Hemispherical Resonator Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-temperature glassblowing-fabricated micro hemispherical resonator (MHR) exhibits high symmetry and high Q-value for precision inertial navigation. However, MHR design entails a comprehensive evaluation of multiple possible configurations and demands extremely time-consuming simulation of key parameters combination. To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius. By checking fabricating feasibility of anchor radius and allowing rapid modal characteristics evaluation without interference, ablation and comparative experiments validated the method's superiority, as an effective support of MHR design. Design optimization experiments demonstrate a prediction accuracy of 96.35%, with computational time reduced to 1/48,000 of traditional finite element methods, significantly improving design efficiency. This study offers a new paradigm for intelligent Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) device design under complex process conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <title>Structural Methods for handling mode changes in multimode DAE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid systems are an important concept in Cyber-Physical Systems modeling, for which multiphysics modeling from first principles and the reuse of models from libraries are key. To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user.</description>

      <title>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</description>

      <title>Improving Bayesian Optimization for Portfolio Management with an Adaptive Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing black-box portfolio management systems are prevalent in the financial industry due to commercial and safety constraints, though their performance can fluctuate dramatically with changing market regimes. Evaluating these non-transparent systems is computationally expensive, as fixed budgets limit the number of possible observations. Therefore, achieving stable and sample-efficient optimization for these systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework (TPE-AS) that improves search stability and efficiency for black-box portfolio models under these limited observation budgets. Standard Bayesian optimization, which solely maximizes expected return, can yield erratic search trajectories and misalign the surrogate model with the true objective, thereby wasting the limited evaluation budget. To mitigate these issues, we propose a weighted Lagrangian estimator that leverages an adaptive schedule and importance sampling. This estimator dynamically balances exploration and exploitation by incorporating both the maximization of model performance and the minimization of the variance of model observations. It guides the search from broad, performance-seeking exploration towards stable and desirable regions as the optimization progresses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies, which establish our proposed method as the primary approach and other configurations as baselines, demonstrate its effectiveness across four backtest settings with three distinct black-box portfolio management models.</description>

      <title>Repeater Swarm-Assisted Cellular Systems: Interaction Stability and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.</description>
