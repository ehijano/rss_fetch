      <title>Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants and tropical varieties of integral homology jump loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Papadima and Suciu studied the relationship between the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz (short as BNSR) invariants of spaces and the homology jump loci of rank one local systems. Recently, Suciu improved these results using the tropical variety associated to the homology jump loci of complex rank one local systems. In particular, the translated positive-dimensional component of homology jump loci can be detected by its tropical variety. In this paper, we generalize Suciu's results to integral coefficients and give a better upper bound for the BNSR invariants. Then we provide applications mainly to K\"ahler groups. Specifically, we classify the K\"ahler group contained in a large class of groups, which we call the weighted right-angled Artin groups. This class of groups comes from the edge-weighted finite simple graphs and is a natural generalization of the right-angled Artin groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give several applications of the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariant on K\"ahler groups. Specifically, we provide simpler proof of the Napier-Ramachandran theorem on the HNN extension about K\"ahler groups and show that amenable K\"ahler groups have an empty complement of the BNS invariant.</description>

      <title>Characterizatioin of the OU matrix of a braid diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OU matrix of a braid diagram is a square matrix that represents the number of over/under crossings of each pair of strands. In this paper, the OU matrix of a pure braid diagram is characterized for up to 5 strands. As an application, the crossing matrix of a positive pure braid is also characterized for up to 5 strands. Moreover, a standard form of the OU matrix is given and characterized for general braids of up to 5 strands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Kauffman bracket skein module of the $(3,3,3,3)$-pretzel link exterior over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ is not finitely generated as a module over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})[t_1,t_2]$, where $t_1,t_2$ are the meridians of two components. This disproves a finiteness conjecture proposed in 2021.</description>

      <title>BPS invariants from framed links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the BPS invariants associated with framed links. We extend the relationship between the algebraic curve (i.e. dual $A$-polynomial) and the BPS invariants of a knot investigated in \cite{GKS} to the case of a framed knot. With the help of the framing change formula for the dual $A$-polynomial of a framed knot, we give several explicit formulas for the extremal $A$-polynomials and the BPS invariants of framed knots. As to the framed links, we present several numerical calculations for the Ooguri-Vafa invariants and BPS invariants for framed Whitehead links and Borromean rings and verify the integrality property for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence of distinct closed surfaces in a hyperbolic 3-manifold M is asymptotically geodesic if their principal curvatures tend uniformly to zero. When M has finite volume, we show such sequences are always asymptotically dense in the 2-plane Grassmann bundle of M. When M has infinite volume and is geometrically finite, we show such sequences do not exist. As an application of the former, we obtain partial answers to the question of whether a negatively curved Riemannian 3-manifold that contains a sequence of asymptotically totally geodesic or totally umbilic surfaces must be hyperbolic. Finally, we give examples to show that if the dimension of M is greater than 3, the possible limiting behavior of asymptotically geodesic surfaces is less constrained than for totally geodesic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Canonical representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,n}$ be an orientable surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We study actions of the mapping class group of $\Sigma_{g,n}$ via Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic techniques. We show that if $$\rho: \pi_1(\Sigma_{g,n})\to GL_r(\mathbb{C})$$ is a representation whose conjugacy class has finite orbit under the mapping class group, and $r&lt;\sqrt{g+1}$, then $\rho$ has finite image. This answers questions of Junho Peter Whang and Mark Kisin. We give applications of our methods to the Putman-Wieland conjecture, the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, and a question of Esnault-Kerz.
  The proofs rely on non-abelian Hodge theory, our earlier work on semistability of isomonodromic deformations, and recent work of Esnault-Groechenig and Klevdal-Patrikis on Simpson's integrality conjecture for cohomologically rigid local systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06423v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spatial surface is a compact surface embedded in the $3$-sphere. We assume that a spatial surface is oriented and that each connected component of a spatial surface is neither a disk nor without a boundary. A diagram of a spatial surface is a diagram of a spatial trivalent graph that is a spine of the spatial surface. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a groupoid rack, which is used for considering colorings for diagrams of spatial surfaces in order to obtain an invariant of spatial surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a groupoid rack has a universal property on colorings for diagrams of spatial surfaces.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of knot groups and knot symmetric quandles of surface-links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The knot group is the fundamental group of a knot or link complement. A necessary and sufficient conditions for a group to be realized as the knot group of some link was provided. This result was shown using the closed braid method. Gonz\'alez-Acu\~na and Kamada independently extended this characterization to the knot groups of orientable surface-links. Kamada applied the closed 2-dimensional braid method to show this result. In this paper, we generalize these results to characterize the knot groups of surface-links, including non-orientable ones. We use a plat presentation for surface-links to prove it. Furthermore, we show a similar characterization for the knot symmetric quandles of surface-links. As an application, we show that every dihedral quandle with an arbitrarily good involution can be realized as the knot symmetric quandle of a surface-link.</description>

      <title>Second bounded cohomology of knot quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bounded cohomology of quandles and its applications to knot theory. We establish two key results that provide sufficient conditions for the infinite dimensionality of the second bounded cohomology of quandles. The first condition involves a subspace of homogeneous group quasimorphisms on the inner automorphism group of the quandle, whereas the second condition concerns the vanishing of the stable commutator length on a subgroup of this inner automorphism group. As topological applications, we show that the second bounded cohomology of the quandle of any non-split link whose link group is non-solvable as well as the quandle of any split link, is infinite dimensional. From these results, we conclude that the second bounded cohomology of the knot quandle detects the unknot. On the algebraic side, we prove that the second bounded cohomology of a free product of quandles is infinite dimensional if the inner automorphism group of at least one of the free factors is amenable. This leads to the result that the second bounded cohomology of free quandles of rank greater than one, as well as their canonical quotients, is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braided algebras are associative algebras endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator that satisfies certain compatibility conditions involving the multiplication. Along with Hochschild cohomology of algebras, there is also a notion of Yang-Baxter cohomology, which is associated to any Yang-Baxter operator. In this article, we introduce and study a cohomology theory for braided algebras in dimensions 2 and 3, that unifies Hochschild and Yang-Baxter cohomology theories, and generalizes to all dimensions in characteristic $2$. We show that its second cohomology group classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras. We provide infinite families of examples of braided algebras, including Hopf algebras, tensorized multiple conjugation quandles, and braided Frobenius algebras. Moreover, we derive the obstructions to higher deformations, which lie in the third cohomology group. Relations to Hopf algebra cohomology are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two families of hyperbolic polygons: ideal and ideal once-punctured, some of whose spikes are decorated with horoballs. We show that the arc complexes of these two families of surfaces, generated by edge-to-edge arcs and edge-to-decorated-spike arcs, are closed piecewise linear balls. This is proved in a completely combinatorial setting: compact polygons whose vertices are assigned red or blue colouring. In order to prove the ballness, we show that these simplicial complexes are pseudo-manifolds and use shellability to conclude. As a consequence, we parametrise weakly-lengthening deformations of the partially decorated hyperbolic polygons.</description>

Abstract: We explore for compact Riemannian surfaces whose boundary consists of a single closed geodesic the relationship between orthospectrum and boundary length. More precisely, we establish a uniform lower bound on the boundary length in terms of the orthospectrum when fixing a metric invariant of the surface related to the classical notion of volume entropy. This inequality can be thought of as a Riemannian analog of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braided algebras are algebraic structures consisting of an algebra endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator, satisfying some compatibility conditions.Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology was introduced by the authors to classify infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras, and determine obstructions to higher order deformations. Several examples of braided algebras satisfy a weaker version of commutativity, which is called braided commutativity and involves the Yang-Baxter operator of the algebra. We extend the theory of Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology to study braided commutative deformations of braided algebras. The resulting cohomology theory classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras that are braided commutative, and provides obstructions for braided commutative higher order deformations. We consider braided commutativity for Hopf algebras in detail, and obtain some classes of nontrivial examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the element $h_6^2$ is a permanent cycle in the Adams spectral sequence. As a result, we establish the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, thereby resolving the final case of the Kervaire invariant problem.
  Combining this result with the theorems of Browder, Mahowald--Tangora, Barratt--Jones--Mahowald, and Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, we conclude that smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one exist in and only in dimensions $2, 6, 14, 30, 62$, and $126$.</description>
