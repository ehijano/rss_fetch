      <title>Improving S&amp;P 500 Volatility Forecasting through Regime-Switching Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial market volatility is critical for risk management, derivatives pricing, and investment strategy. In this study, we propose a multitude of regime-switching methods to improve the prediction of S&amp;P 500 volatility by capturing structural changes in the market across time. We use eleven years of SPX data, from May 1st, 2014 to May 27th, 2025, to compute daily realized volatility (RV) from 5-minute intraday log returns, adjusted for irregular trading days. To enhance forecast accuracy, we engineered features to capture both historical dynamics and forward-looking market sentiment across regimes. The regime-switching methods include a soft Markov switching algorithm to estimate soft-regime probabilities, a distributional spectral clustering method that uses XGBoost to assign clusters at prediction time, and a coefficient-based soft regime algorithm that extracts HAR coefficients from time segments segmented through the Mood test and clusters through Bayesian GMM for soft regime weights, using XGBoost to predict regime probabilities. Models were evaluated across three time periods--before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The coefficient-based clustering algorithm outperformed all other models, including the baseline autoregressive model, during all time periods. Additionally, each model was evaluated on its recursive forecasting performance for 5- and 10-day horizons during each time period. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of regime-aware modeling frameworks and soft clustering approaches in improving volatility forecasting, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty and structural change.</description>

      <title>Panel regression for the GDP of the Central and Eastern European countries using time-varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries into the European Economic Area serves as a valuable experiment for the regional economic development theory. The long-lasting convergence of these economies with more advanced Western Europe exhibits a few standard features and varying policies implemented. Even the Baltic countries, which started from very similar starting positions, demonstrate their unique trajectories of development. We employ a panel data regression model that allows coefficients to vary over time to compare the contributions of a few macroeconomic factors to the GDP growth of CEE countries. In particular, we regress the annual change of GDP per capita in PPP terms as a function of achieved GDP, price, trade, investment, and debt levels. Time-varying common slope coefficients in this approach describe the external economic environment in which countries implement their own policies. The panel consists of 11 Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia), which have been observed annually from 1995 to 2024. While the main selected factors of this investigation contribute to economic growth, in agreement with previous findings, the role of private debt appears vital in determining the pace of economic growth.</description>

      <title>Gini-based Model Monitoring: A General Framework with an Application to Non-life Insurance Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a dynamic landscape where portfolios and environments evolve, maintaining the accuracy of pricing models is critical. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine concept drift in non-life insurance pricing. We (i) provide an overview of the relevant literature and commonly used methodologies, clarify the distinction between virtual drift and concept drift, and explain their implications for long-run model performance; (ii) review and formalize common performance measures, including the Gini index and deviance loss, and articulate their interpretation; (iii) derive the asymptotic distribution of the Gini index, enabling valid inference and hypothesis testing; and (iv) present a standardized monitoring procedure that indicates when refitting is warranted. We illustrate the framework using a modified real-world portfolio with induced concept drift and discuss practical considerations and pitfalls.</description>

      <title>PDSim: A Shiny App for Simulating and Estimating Polynomial Diffusion Models in Commodity Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDSim is an R package that enables users to simulate commodity futures prices using the polynomial diffusion model introduced in Filipovic &amp; Larsson (2016) through both a Shiny web application and R scripts. For user-supplied data, a standalone R routine has been developed to provide joint estimation of state variables and model parameters via the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). With its user-friendly interface, PDSim makes the features of simulations and estimations accessible. To date, it is the only package specifically designed for the simulation and estimation of the polynomial diffusion model. The Schwartz-Smith two-factor model (Schwartz &amp; Smith, 2000) is also available within this package for both simulation and calibration.
  The package is validated through several tests, including replication of the results in Schwartz &amp; Smith (2000), unit testing of the coverage rate, and verification of the outputs of the main functions.</description>
