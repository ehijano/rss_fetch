      <title>Current and Future Directions for Responsible Quantum Technologies: A ResQT Community Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies (QT) are advancing rapidly, promising advancements across a wide spectrum of applications but also raising significant ethical, societal, and geopolitical impacts, including dual-use capabilities, varying levels of access, and impending quantum divide(s). To address these, the Responsible Quantum Technologies (ResQT) community was established to share knowledge, perspectives, and best practices across various disciplines. Its mission is to ensure QT developments align with ethical principles, promote equity, and mitigate unintended consequences. Initial progress has been made, as scholars and policymakers increasingly recognize principles of responsible QT. However, more widespread dissemination is needed, and as QT matures, so must responsible QT. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the ResQT community's current work and states necessary future directions. Drawing on historical lessons from artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, actions targeting the quantum divide(s) are addressed, including the implementation of responsible research and innovation, fostering wider stakeholder engagement, and sustainable development. These actions aim to build trust and engagement, facilitating the participatory and responsible development of QT. The ResQT community advocates that responsible QT should be an integral part of quantum development rather than an afterthought so that quantum technologies evolve toward a future that is technologically advanced and beneficial for all.</description>

      <title>Diversity mitigates polarization and consensus in opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the opinion dynamics in a population by considering a variant of Kuramoto model where the phase of an oscillator represents the opinion of an individual on a single topic. Two extreme phases separated by $\pi$ represent opposing views. Any other phase is considered as an intermediate opinion between the two extremes. The interaction (or attitude) between two individuals depends on the difference between their opinions and can be positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) based on the defined thresholds. We investigate the opinion dynamics when these thresholds are varied. We observe explosive transition from a bipolarized state to a consensus state with the existence of scattered and tri-polarized states at low values of threshold parameter. The system exhibits multistability between various states in a sizeable parameter region. These transitions and multistability are studied in populations with different degrees of diversity represented by the width of conviction distribution. We found that a more homogeneous population has greater tendency to exhibit bipolarized, tri-polarized and clustered states while a diverse population helps mitigate polarization among individuals by reaching to a consensus sooner. Ott-Antonsen analysis is used to analyse the system's long term macroscopic behaviour and verify the numerical results. We also study the effects of neutral individuals that do not interact with others or do not change their attitude on opinion formation, nature of transitions and multistability. Furthermore, we apply our model to language data to study the assimilation of diverse languages in India and compare the results with those obtained from model equations.</description>

      <title>Robustness and resilience of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks are ubiquitous: a cell, the human brain, a group of people and the Internet are all examples of interconnected many-body systems characterized by macroscopic properties that cannot be trivially deduced from those of their microscopic constituents. Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.</description>

      <title>2025 Southeast Asia Eleven Nations Influence Index Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constructs a fully data-driven and reproducible Southeast Asia Influence Index (SAII v3) to reduce bias from expert scoring and subjective weighting while mapping hierarchical power structures across the eleven ASEAN nations. We aggregate authoritative open-source indicators across four dimensions (economic, military, diplomatic, socio-technological) and apply a three-tiered standardization chain quantile-Box-Cox-min-max to mitigate outliers and skewness. Weights are obtained through equal-weight integration of Entropy Weighting Method (EWM), CRITIC, and PCA. Robustness is assessed via Kendall's tau, +/-20% weight perturbation, and 10,000 bootstrap iterations, with additional checks including +/-10% dimensional sensitivity and V2-V3 bump chart comparisons. Results show integrated weights: Economy 35-40%, Military 20-25%, Diplomacy about 20%, Socio-Technology about 15%. The regional landscape exhibits a one-strong, two-medium, three-stable, and multiple-weak pattern: Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia lead, while Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam form a mid-tier competitive band. V2 and V3 rankings are highly consistent (Kendall's tau = 0.818), though small mid-tier reorderings appear (Thailand and the Philippines rise, Vietnam falls), indicating that v3 is more sensitive to structural equilibrium. ASEAN-11 average sensitivity highlights military and socio-technological dimensions as having the largest marginal effects (+/-0.002). In conclusion, SAII v3 delivers algorithmic weighting and auditable reproducibility, reveals multidimensional drivers of influence in Southeast Asia, and provides actionable quantitative evidence for resource allocation and policy prioritization by regional governments and external partners.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gillespie algorithms for spreading phenomena in large and heterogeneous higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order dynamics refer to mechanisms where collective mutual or synchronous interactions differ fundamentally from their pairwise counterparts through the concept of many-body interactions. Phenomena absent in pairwise models, such as catastrophic activation, hysteresis, and hybrid transitions, emerge naturally in higher-order interacting systems. Thus, the simulation of contagion dynamics on higher-order structures is algorithmically and computationally challenging due to the complexity of propagation through hyperedges of arbitrary order. To address this issue, optimized Gillespie algorithms were constructed for higher-order structures by means of phantom processes: events that do not change the state of the system but still account for time progression. We investigate the algorithm's performance considering the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with critical mass thresholds on hypergraphs. Optimizations were assessed on networks of different sizes and levels of heterogeneity in both connectivity and order interactions, in a high epidemic prevalence regime. Algorithms with phantom processes are shown to outperform standard approaches by several orders of magnitude in the limit of large sizes. Indeed, a high computational complexity scaling $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ with system size $N$ of the standard algorithms is improved to low complexity scaling nearly as $\mathcal{O}(N)$. The optimized methods allow for the simulation of highly heterogeneous networks with millions of nodes within affordable computation costs, significantly surpassing the size range and order heterogeneity currently considered.</description>

      <title>Ising dynamics on multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.</description>

      <title>When Energy-Efficiency May Not Yield Positive Climate Impact -- The Case of Adaptive Radiative Coolers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The climate impact of building envelopes is often quantified using their energy savings and CO2 emission reduction benefits. However, building envelopes also trap solar and thermal infrared heat, which is dissipated as a direct heating penalty into our warming planet. For static or adaptive envelopes that passively heat buildings by radiatively retaining heat, these two effects are antagonistic. Yet, their net effect remains unexplored. In this study, we compare the emission reductions benefit, and direct heating penalty of two classes of roof envelopes, traditional and adaptive radiative coolers (TRCs and ARCs). Calculations for buildings in different urban climates show that relative to TRCs like cool roofs, ARCs like smart roofs may have a net heating impact on earth well past this century. Thus, despite their relative energy savings and CO2 emissions reductions benefits, adaptive envelopes on roofs have a negative climate impact relative to traditional cooling designs. Our findings are generalizable across climates and a range of building envelopes and call for a rethinking of how sustainability is quantified for building envelopes, and of material and architectural design for buildings.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Frequency--Domain Inference of Network Topology and Hidden Components via Structure--Behavior Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden interactions and components in complex systems-ranging from covert actors in terrorist networks to unobserved brain regions and molecular regulators-often manifest only through indirect behavioral signals. Inferring the underlying network structure from such partial observations remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under nonlinear dynamics. We uncover a robust linear relationship between the spectral strength of a node's behavioral time series under evolutionary game dynamics and its structural degree, $S \propto k$, a structural-behavioral scaling that holds across network types and scales, revealing a universal correspondence between local connectivity and dynamic energy. Leveraging this insight, we develop a deterministic, frequency-domain inference framework based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) that reconstructs network topology directly from payoff sequences-without prior knowledge of the network or internal node strategies-by selectively perturbing node dynamics. The framework simultaneously localizes individual hidden nodes or identifies all edges connected to multiple hidden nodes, and estimates tight bounds on the number of hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both topology reconstruction and hidden component detection. Moreover, it scales efficiently to large networks, offering robustness to stochastic fluctuations and overcoming the size limitations of existing techniques. Our work establishes a principled connection between local dynamic observables and global structural inference, enabling accurate topology recovery in complex systems with hidden elements.</description>

      <title>The networks of ingredient combinations as culinary fingerprints of world cuisines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating how different ingredients are combined in popular dishes is crucial to uncover the principles behind food preferences. Here, we use data from public food repositories and network analysis to characterize and compare worldwide cuisines. Ingredients are first grouped into broader types, and each cuisine is then represented as a network in which nodes correspond to ingredient types and weighted links describe how frequently pairs of types co-occur in recipes. Cuisines differ not only in the popularity of ingredient types and range of recipe sizes, but also in the structural organization of ingredient-type combinations. By analyzing these networks, we uncover distinctive patterns of type associations that serve as culinary fingerprints. For example, European cuisines typically distribute ingredients across different types, whereas certain Asian and South American traditions emphasize one dominant type, such as vegetables or spices. The essence of these patterns is well captured by the networks' maximum spanning trees, which offer a simplified yet representative backbone for each cuisine. We demonstrate that both these full and simplified network representations enable machine learning models to identify cuisines from subsets of recipes with very high accuracy. Networks of ingredient combinations also cluster global cuisines into meaningful geo-cultural groups, reflecting shared patterns in culinary traditions. More broadly, our study offers novel insights into the structure of world cuisines, enabling data-driven approaches to their characterization, cross-cultural comparison, and potential adaptation.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Network Analysis of European Regional Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Regional Economics, the attractiveness of regions for capital, migrants, tourists, and other kinds of flows is a relevant topic. Usually, studies in this field explore single flows, characterizing the dimensions of territorial attractiveness separately, rarely considering the interwoven effect of flows. Here, we investigate attractiveness from a multi-dimensional perspective (i.e., dealing with different flows), asking how various types of regional flows collectively shape the attractiveness dynamics of European regions. We analyze eight distinct flow types across NUTS2 regions from 2010 to 2018, employing a multilayer network approach. Notably, the multilayer approach unveils insights that would be missed in single-layer analyses. Community detection reveals complex structures that demonstrate the cohesive power of national borders and the existence of strong cross-border ties in specific regions. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of regional attractiveness, with implications for targeted policy interventions in regional development and European cohesion.</description>
