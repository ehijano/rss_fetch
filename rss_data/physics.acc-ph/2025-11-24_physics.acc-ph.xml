      <description>arXiv:2511.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is a short introduction to metal forming. The paper highlights the different disciplines that should be considered when analyzing metal forming. Hence, mechanical flow, heat flow, mechanical and thermal contact, and microstructure evolution are presented within the perspective of metal forming. For every aspect, well-established knowledge is presented in addition to scientific open questions on which active research is still done.</description>

      <title>The impact of ionising collisions on channeling and radiation emission for high-energy electrons and positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impact of inelastic collisions with atoms in a crystalline environment on the channeling efficiency and intensity of the channeling radiation for high-energy electrons and positrons passing through oriented crystalline targets. This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Characterisation and mitigation of RF knockout during beam stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam stacking allows a Fixed Field alternating gradient Accelerator (FFA) to increase the extracted beam current whilst also allowing for a flexible time structure making FFAs a promising candidate for future spallation neutron sources and high beam intensity applications. For successful beam stacking, beam loss caused by RF knockout must be avoided. RF knockout can occur during beam stacking because of the finite dispersion function at the RF cavity location, which is unavoidable in a scaling FFA. In this work, the RF knockout resonance is characterised and through a series of experiments at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, we show that it is possible to suppress the loss from RF knockout.</description>

      <title>A compact, easy-to-use leak detector for vacuum systems based on the MQ-8 sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a compact leak detector for vacuum systems that operates using hydrogen as a tracer gas, detected by a semiconductor MQ-8 sensor. The sensor is connected to an Arduino microcontroller, enabling digital signal processing and real-time visualization through the Processing software environment. The designed device is capable of detecting even small hydrogen leaks caused by imperfect sealing of vacuum connections. It is characterized by simplicity, low manufacturing cost, and suitability for laboratory use as an alternative to helium leak detectors. Experimental tests confirmed the effectiveness and stability of the developed leak detector during long-term measurements.</description>

      <title>Radiation Effects on Stepper Motors and Lubricants: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of electrical motors and other remote systems are important tools in radiation environments. Certain harsh radiation environments, such as particle accelerators, require the use of remote systems during operation. Stepper motors are one motor, in particular, that have acquired interest in the nuclear field for use in these remote systems. The stepper motor's precision in rotation and holding is a highly desired quality. In this review, the stepper motor is examined for use in radiation environments. The different mechanical parts are introduced and examined from the broader literature of previous work. We attempt to explain the different radiation destructive mechanisms involved with each part of the stepper motor and how the mechanics are affected. Current and past research is explored, identifying either radiation hard alternatives or thresholds of the materials involved, and a general review of stepper motor radiation effects as available in literature.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Fiber Sensing for Research Campuses and Large Scientific Infrastructures -- The Hamburg WAVE proto-network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate and investigate how Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can be utilized on research campuses and in large scientific infrastructures to study environmental vibrations and reduce their impact on high-precision experiments. We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design of the Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous conversion of muonium to antimuonium is one of the interesting charged lepton flavor violation phenomena offering a sensitive probe of potential new physics and serving as a tool to constrain the parameter space beyond the Standard Model. The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is designed to utilize a high-intensity muon beam, a Michel electron magnetic spectrometer, a positron transport system, and a positron detection system, to either discover or constrain this rare process with a conversion probability of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$. This article presents an overview of the theoretical framework as well as a detailed description of the experimental design for the search for muonium-to-antimuonium conversion.</description>
