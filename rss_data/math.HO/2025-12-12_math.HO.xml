      <title>Developing a Learner-Centered Teaching Routine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shares a classroom story from Fall 2022 to Spring 2025 about a learner centered routine in undergraduate mathematics. I use four steps: an opening question, a short mini lecture about meaning, structured small group work, and a short end of class exit check, sometimes with quick visuals. I used this mainly in elementary statistics, with some use in calculus and linear algebra. The evidence is local and practical: my notes, one minute exit checks, informal student comments and surveys, and conference feedback. Across courses, I saw less passive lecturing, more visible participation, and students explaining their reasoning during the closing time. Limits are clear: one instructor and no controlled comparisons. Next I plan to improve the prompts for different student groups and to simplify the visuals. I offer a simple routine and timing that other instructors can adapt to their own classes.</description>

      <title>The Two-Step Property and the Mathematics of Musical Scale Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Pythagorean scale is a mathematical encoding of a musical scale as a finite list of numbers of the form 3^b/2^a. Previous work of the first author introduced the 2-step property as a way to measure which Pythagorean scales are the most "evenly-spaced." In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the Pythagorean scales that have the 2-step property; compellingly, the list includes the 5-note, 7-note, and 12-note Pythagorean scales, which are well-known as the pentatonic, diatonic, and chromatic scales of music theory.</description>

      <title>HNN extensions and embedding theorems for groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Higman-Neumann-Neumann (HNN) paper of 1949 is a landmark of group theory in the twentieth century. The proof of its main theorem covers less than a page and uses only pre-existing technology, but the construction that it introduced -- the HNN extension -- quickly became one of the principal tools of combinatorial group theory, widely used to build new groups and to describe enlightening decompositions of existing groups. In this article, we shall describe the contents of the HNN paper, and then discuss some of the important developments that followed in its wake, leading up to the central role that HNN extensions play in the Bass--Serre theory of groups acting on trees.</description>
