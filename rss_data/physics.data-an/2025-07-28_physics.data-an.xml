      <title>Quantifying Coupled Dynamics in Phase-Space from State Distribution Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify nonlinear interactions between coupled complex processes, when the system is subject to noise and not all its components are measurable. Our method is applicable even when the system cannot be continuously monitored over time, but is rather observed only in snapshots. Having only partial information about the local topology of the network and observations of relevant interacting variables is sufficient to translate qualitative knowledge of interactions into a quantitative characterization of the coupled dynamics. This approach turns a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable inference problems, to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete snapshots of their statistical state.</description>

      <title>Theoretical correction methods for optical tweezers: Acquisition of potentials of mean forces between colloidal particles in a bulk and on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10722v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that line optical tweezers (LOT) can measure potential of mean force (PMF) between colloidal particles in the bulk. However, PMF obtained with LOT is empirically modified before showing the result of the final form in order to correct the potential rise at long distances. In the present letter, we derive theoretical correction methods for acquisition of PMF by using statistical mechanics. Using the new methods, PMF can be obtained without the empirical fitting equation. Through the new methods, external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles induced by LOT can also be obtained. As an additional study, we explain two methods for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles on a substrate surface, in which a normal single optical tweezers with a fixed focal point is used, and for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles trapped by dual-beam optical tweezers in the bulk. These methods can also obtain the external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles.</description>
