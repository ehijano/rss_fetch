      <title>An $\infty$-Laplacian for differential forms, and calibrated laminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Thurston and Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck's approach to Teichm\"uller theory, we study the behavior of $q$-harmonic functions and their $p$-harmonic conjugates in the limit as $q \to 1$, where $1/p + 1/q = 1$. The $1$-Laplacian is already known to give rise to laminations by minimal hypersurfaces; we show that the limiting $p$-harmonic conjugates converge to calibrations $F$ of the laminations. Moreover, we show that the laminations which are calibrated by $F$ are exactly those which arise from the $1$-Laplacian. We also explore the limiting dual problem as a model problem for the optimal Lipschitz extension problem, which exhibits behavior rather unlike the scalar $\infty$-Laplacian. In a companion work, we will apply the main result of this paper to associate to each class in $H^{d - 1}$ a lamination in a canonical way, and study the duality of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}$.</description>

      <title>On diffusion and transport acting on parameterized moving closed curves in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of closed, smooth non-self-intersecting curves that evolve in space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The geometric evolutionary equation for the evolution of the curve is accompanied by a parabolic equation for the scalar quantity evaluated over the evolving curve. We apply the direct Lagrangian approach to describe the geometric flow of 3D curves resulting in a system of degenerate parabolic equations. We prove the local existence and uniqueness of classical H\"older smooth solutions to the governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations. A numerical discretization scheme has been constructed using the method of flowing finite volumes. We present several numerical examples of the evolution of curves in 3D with a scalar quantity. In this paper, we analyze the flow of curves with no torsion evolving in rotating and parallel planes. Next, we present examples of the evolution of curves with initially knotted and unknotted curves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Flux and Quantum Ergodicity for Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For sequences of quantum ergodic eigenfunctions, we define the quantum flux norm associated to a codimension $1$ submanifold $\Sigma$ of a non-degenerate energy surface. We prove restrictions of eigenfunctions to $\Sigma$, realized using the quantum flux norm, are quantum ergodic. We compare this result to known results from \cite{CTZ} in the case of Euclidean domains and hyperfurfaces. As a further application, we consider complexified analytic eigenfunctions and prove a second microlocal analogue of \cite{CTZ} in that context.</description>

      <title>Derivation and analysis of a nonlocal Hele-Shaw-Cahn-Hilliard system for flow in thin heterogeneous layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive, through the deterministic homogenization theory in thin domains, a new model consisting of Hele-Shaw equation with memory coupled with the convective Cahn-Hilliard equation. The obtained system, which models in particular tumor growth, is then analyzed and we prove its well-posedness in dimension 2. To achieve our goal, we develop and use the new concept of sigma-convergence in thin heterogeneous media, and we prove some regularity results for the upscaled model.</description>

      <title>The modified Korteweg--de Vries limit of the Ablowitz--Ladik system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For slowly-varying initial data, solutions to the Ablowitz-Ladik system have been proven to converge to solutions of the cubic Schr\"odinger equation. In this paper we show that in the continuum limit, solutions to the Ablowitz-Ladik system with $H^1$ initial data may also converge to solutions of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. To exhibit this new limiting behavior, it suffices that the initial data is supported near the inflection points of the dispersion relation associated with the Ablowitz-Ladik system.
  Our arguments employ harmonic analysis tools, Strichartz estimates, and the conservation of mass and energy. Correspondingly, they are applicable beyond the completely integrable models of greatest interest to us.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Hydrodynamic Stability for Couette Flow on Unbounded Domains with Navier Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a stability threshold theorem for 2D Navier-Stokes on three unbounded domains: the whole plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, the half plane $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\infty)$ with Navier boundary conditions, and the infinite channel $\mathbb{R} \times [-1, 1]$ with Navier boundary conditions. Starting with the Couette shear flow, we consider initial perturbations $\omega_{in}$ which are of size $\nu^{1/2}(1+\ln(1/\nu)^{1/2})^{-1}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space with an additional low frequency control condition for the planar cases. We then demonstrate that such perturbations exhibit inviscid damping of the velocity, as well as enhanced dissipation at $x$-frequencies $|k| \gg \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu^{-1/3}|k|^{-2/3})$. On the plane and half-plane, we show Taylor dispersion for $x$-frequencies $|k| \ll \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu |k|^{-2})$, while on the channel we show low frequency dispersion for $|k| \ll \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu^{-1})$. Generalizing the work of arXiv:2311.00141 done on $\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$, the key contribution of this paper is to perform new nonlinear computations at low frequencies with wave number $|k| \lesssim \nu$ and at intermediate frequencies with wave number $\nu \lesssim |k| \leq 1$, and to provide the first enhanced dissipation result for a fully-nonlinear shear flow on an unbounded $x$-domain.</description>

      <title>A continuous approach of modeling tumorigenesis and axons regulation for the pancreatic cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pancreatic innervation undergoes dynamic remodeling during the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Denervation experiments have shown that different types of axons can exert either pro- or anti-tumor effects, but conflicting results exist in the literature, leaving the overall influence of the nervous system on PDAC incompletely understood. To address this gap, we propose a continuous mathematical model of nerve-tumor interactions that allows in silico simulation of denervation at different phases of tumor development. This model takes into account the pro- or anti-tumor properties of different types of axons (sympathetic or sensory) and their distinct remodeling dynamics during PDAC development. We observe a "shift effect" where an initial pro-tumor effect of sympathetic axon denervation is later outweighed by the anti-tumor effect of sensory axon denervation, leading to a transition from an overall protective to a deleterious role of the nervous system on PDAC tumorigenesis. Our model also highlights the importance of the impact of sympathetic axon remodeling dynamics on tumor progression. These findings may guide strategies targeting the nervous system to improve PDAC treatment.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for 2D inhomogeneous viscous flows with rough data via dynamic interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of two-dimensional incompressible flows with variable density, only bounded and bounded away from zero. Assuming that the initial velocity belongs to a suitable critical subspace of L^2 , we prove a global-in-time existence and stability result for the initial (boundary) value problem. Our proof relies on new time decay estimates for finite energy weak solutions and on a 'dynamic interpolation' argument. We show that the constructed solutions have a uniformly C^1 flow, which ensures the propagation of geometrical structures in the fluid and guarantees that the Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations of the equations are equivalent. By adopting this latter formulation, we establish the uniqueness of the solutions for prescribed data, and the continuity of the flow map in an energy-like functional framework. In contrast with prior works, our results hold true in the critical regularity setting without any smallness assumption. Our approach uses only elementary tools and applies indistinctly to the cases where the fluid domain is the whole plane, a smooth two-dimensional bounded domain or the torus.</description>

      <title>Forward self-similar solutions to the MHD equations in the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of forward self-similar solutions to the three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD equations) with arbitrarily large self-similar initial data. Using the so called blow-up argument, we establish the necessary a priori estimates. Subsequently, the Leray-Schauder theorem allows us to construct a self-similar solutions of the MHD equations.</description>

      <title>Self-similar intermediate asymptotics for first-order mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intermediate asymptotic behavior of solutions to the first-order mean field games system with a local coupling, when the initial density is a compactly supported function on the real line, and the coupling is of power type. Addressing a question that was left open in arXiv:2308.00314, we prove that the solutions converge to the self-similar profile. We proceed by analyzing a continuous rescaling of the solution, and identifying an appropriate Lyapunov functional. We identify a critical value for the parameter of the coupling, which determines the qualitative behavior of the functional, and the well-posedness of the infinite horizon system. Accordingly, we also establish, in the subcritical and critical cases, a second convergence result which characterizes the behavior of the full solution as the time horizon approaches infinity. We also prove the corresponding results for the mean field planning problem. A large part of our analysis and methodology apply just as well to arbitrary dimensions. As such, this work is a major step towards settling these questions in the higher-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>A weak-strong uniqueness principle for the Mullins-Sekerka equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a weak-strong uniqueness principle for the two-phase Mullins-Sekerka equation in the plane: As long as a classical solution to the evolution problem exists, any weak De Giorgi type varifold solution (see for this notion the recent work of Stinson and the second author, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 248, 8, 2024) must coincide with it. In particular, in the absence of geometric singularities such weak solutions do not introduce a mechanism for (unphysical) non-uniqueness. We also derive a stability estimate with respect to changes in the data. Our method is based on the notion of relative entropies for interface evolution problems, a reduction argument to a perturbative graph setting (which is the only step in our argument exploiting in an essential way the planar setting), and a stability analysis in this perturbative regime relying crucially on the gradient flow structure of the Mullins-Sekerka equation.</description>

      <title>Transformation of $p$-gradient flows to $p'$-gradient flows in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct parameter transformations between gradient flows in metric spaces, called curves of maximal slope, having different exponents when the associated function satisfies a suitable convexity condition. These transformations induce the uniqueness of gradient flows for all exponents under a natural assumption which is satisfied in many examples. We also prove the regularizing effects of gradient flows. To establish these results, we directly deal with gradient flows instead of using variational discrete approximations which are often used in the study of gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Cloaking Electric and Hydrodynamic Fields via Electro-osmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for the electro-osmosis problem to design simultaneous microscale electric and hydrodynamic cloaking in a Hele-Shaw configuration. A novel approach to achieving simultaneously cloaking both the electric and flow fields through a combination of scattering-cancellation technology and an electro-osmosis effect is proposed. In the design, the electric field is manipulated with scattering-cancellation technology while the pressure with electro-osmosis effect. As proof of this concept, the perfect electric and hydrodynamic cloaking conditions are derived for the cloaks with the cross-sectional shape being annulus or confocal ellipses using the layer potential techniques. Furthermore, we also propose an optimization scheme for the design of approximate cloaks within general geometries and prove the well-posedness of the optimization problem. In particular, the conditions that can ensure the simultaneous occurrence of approximate cloaks for general geometries are also established. Our theoretical findings are validated by a variety of numerical results and guide efficiently designing electric-related multiphysics cloaking.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric steady Navier-Stokes flows under suction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of solutions for the axisymmetric steady Navier-Stokes system around an infinite cylinder under external forces. The solutions are constructed to be decaying at the horizontal infinity, despite an analogue of the Stokes paradox for the linearized system, and having neither periodicity nor decay in the vertical direction. The proof is based on perturbation of the nonlinear system around a suction flow. The class of functions in this paper, which is a subspace of the space of Fourier transformed vector finite Radon measures, is inspired by Giga-Saal (2013) treating rotating boundary layers.</description>

Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of $L^1$ blow-down limit at infinity for an entire minimizing solution $u:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ of a planar Allen-Cahn system with a triple-well potential. Consequently, $u$ can be approximated by a triple junction map at infinity. The proof exploits a careful analysis of energy upper and lower bounds, ensuring that the diffuse interface remains within a small neighborhood of the approximated triple junction at all scales.</description>

      <title>Stability of multiphase mean curvature flow beyond circular topology changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a weak-strong uniqueness principle for varifold-BV solutions to planar multiphase mean curvature flow beyond a circular topology change: Assuming that there exists a classical solution with an interface that becomes increasingly circular and shrinks to a point, any varifold-BV solution with the same initial interface must coincide with it, and any varifold-BV solution with similar initial data must undergo the same type of topology change. Our result illustrates the robustness of the relative energy method for establishing weak-strong uniqueness principles for interface evolution equations, showing that it may also be applied beyond certain topological changes.</description>

      <title>Late time tail of waves on dynamic asymptotically flat spacetimes of odd space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for understanding the late time tail for solutions to wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes with odd space dimensions. In particular, for a large class of equations, we prove that the precise late time tail is determined by the limits of higher radiation field at future null infinity.
  In the setting of stationary linear equations, we recover and generalize the Price law decay rates. In particular, in addition to reproving known results on $(3+1)$-dimensional black holes, this allows one to obtain the sharp decay rate for the wave equation on higher dimensional black hole spacetimes, which exhibits an anomalous rate due to subtle cancellations. More interesting, our method goes beyond the stationary linear case and applies to both equations on dynamical background and nonlinear equations. In this case, our results can be used to show that in general there is a correction to the Price law rates.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Limiting Minimizers for a Family of Interaction Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two parameter family of energy minimization problems for interaction energies $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ with attractive-repulsive potential $W_{\alpha,\beta}$. We develop a concavity principle, which allows us to provide a lower bound on $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ if there exist $\beta_0&lt;\beta&lt;\beta_1$ with minimizers of $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta_0}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta_1}$ known. In addition to this, we also derive new conclusions about the limiting behaviour of $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ for $\beta\approx 2.$ Finally, we describe a method to show that, for certain values of $(\alpha,\beta),$ $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ cannot be minimized by the uniform distribution over a top-dimensional regular unit simplex. Our results are made possible by two key factors -- recent progress in identifying minimizers of $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ for a range of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and an analysis of $\inf\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ as a function on parameter space.</description>

      <title>Balian-Bloch Wave Invariants for Nearly Degenerate Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part I of a series in which we aim to show that the singular support of the wave trace and the length spectrum of a smooth, strictly convex, and bounded planar billiard table are generally distinct objects. We derive an asymptotic trace formula for the regularized resolvent which is dual to the wave trace and contains the same information. To do this, we consider a class of periodic orbits which have nearly degenerate Poincar\'e maps and study their leading order behavior as the deformation parameter goes to zero, generating large coefficients in the wave trace. We also keep careful track of the Maslov indices, which will allow us to match contributions of opposite signs in our subsequent paper. Each cancellation of coefficients in the resolvent trace corresponds to making the wave trace one degree smoother. The resolvent based approach is due to Balian and Bloch and was significantly expanded upon by Zelditch in a foundational series of papers [Zel09], [Zel04a], [Zel04c] and [Zel00].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence, uniqueness and stability results for the obstacle problem associated with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion equation perturbed by conservative gradient noise. Our approach revolves round introducing a new entropy formulation for stochastic variational inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain a novel well-posedness result for the obstacle problem of deterministic porous medium equations with nonlinear reaction terms.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problems and Hardy spaces for elliptic systems with block structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.02448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For elliptic systems with block structure in the upper half-space and t-independent coefficients, we settle the study of boundary value problems by proving compatible well-posedness of Dirichlet, regularity and Neumann problems in optimal ranges of exponents. Prior to this work, only the two-dimensional situation was fully understood. In higher dimensions, partial results for existence in smaller ranges of exponents and for a subclass of such systems had been established. The presented uniqueness results are completely new. We also elucidate optimal ranges for problems with fractional regularity data. Methods use and improve, with some new results, all the machinery developed over the last two decades to study such problems: the Kato square root estimates and Riesz transforms, Hardy spaces associated to operators, off-diagonal estimates, non-tangential estimates and square functions and abstract layer potentials to replace fundamental solutions in the absence of local regularity of solutions. This self-contained monograph provides a comprehensive overview on the field and unifies many earlier results that have been obtained by a variety of methods.</description>

Abstract: We study in this article the asymptotic behavior of the Mindlin-Timoshenko system subject to a nonlinear dissipation acting only on the equations of the rotation angles. First, we briefly recall the existence of the solution of this system. Then, we prove that the energy associated with the Mindlin-Timoshenko system fulfills a dissipation relationship showing that the energy is decreasing. Moreover, when the wave speeds are equal, we establish an explicit and general decay result for the energy.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectral gap estimates for higher-order operators on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide sharp spectral gap estimates for problems involving higher-order operators (including both the clamped and buckling plate problems) on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The proofs are symmetrization-free -- thus no sharp isoperimetric inequality is needed -- based on two general, yet elementary functional inequalities. The spectral gap estimate for clamped plates solves a sharp asymptotic problem from Cheng and Yang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2011] concerning the behavior of higher-order eigenvalues on hyperbolic spaces, and answers a question raised in Krist\'aly [Adv. Math., 2020] on the validity of such sharp estimates in high-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. As a byproduct of the general functional inequalities, various Rellich inequalities are established in the same geometric setting.</description>

      <title>The analysis of vertex feedback stabilisability of a star-shaped network of fluid-conveying pipes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Elastic fields generated by multiple small inclusions with high mass density at nearly resonant frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the elastic field generated by multiple small-scaled inclusions distributed in a bounded set of $\mathbb{R}^3$. These inclusions are modeled with moderate values of the Lam\'e coefficients while they have a large relative mass density. These properties allow them to enjoy a sequences of resonant frequencies that can be computed via the eigenvalues of the volume integral operator having the Navier fundamental matrix as a kernel, i.e. the Navier volume operator. The dominant field, i.e. the Foldy-Lax field, models the multiple interactions between the inclusions with scattering coefficients that are inversely proportional to the difference between the used incident frequency and the already mentioned resonances. We show, in particular, that to reconstruct remotely the scattered field generated after $N$ interactions between the inclusions, one needs to use an incident frequency appropriately close to the proper resonance of the inclusions. We provide an explicit link between the order $N$ of interactions and the distance from the incident frequency to the resonance. Finally, if the cluster of the inclusions is densely distributed in a given bounded domain, then the expression of the induced dominant field suggests that the equivalent homogenized mass density can change sign depending if the used incident frequencies is smaller or larger than a certain threshold (which is explicitly given in terms of the resonant frequencies of the inclusions).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For given functions $f$ and $j$ on the disc $B$ and its boundary $\partial B=S^1$, we study the existence of conformal metrics $g=e^{2u}g_0$ with prescribed Gauss curvature $K_g=f$ and boundary geodesic curvature $k_g=j$. Using the variational characterization of such metrics obtained by Cruz-Blazquez and Ruiz (2018), we show that there is a canonical negative gradient flow of such metrics, either converging to a solution of the prescribed curvature problem, or blowing up to a spherical cap. In the latter case, similar to our work Struwe (2005) on the prescribed curvature problem on the sphere, we are able to exhibit a $2$-dimensional shadow flow for the center of mass of the evolving metrics from which we obtain existence results complementing the results recently obtained by Ruiz (2021) by degree-theory.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the monotonicity method for an anisotropic scatterer with a conductive boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse scattering problem associated with an anisotropic medium with a conductive boundary. We will assume that the corresponding far-field pattern is known/measured and we consider two inverse problems. First, we show that the far-field data uniquely determines the boundary coefficient. Next, since it is known that anisotropic coefficients are not uniquely determined by this data we will develop a qualitative method to recover the scatterer. To this end, we study the so-called monotonicity method applied to this inverse shape problem. This method has recently been applied to some inverse scattering problems but this is the first time it has been applied to an anisotropic scatterer. This method allows one to recover the scatterer but considering the eigenvalues of an operator associated with the far--field operator. We present some simple numerical reconstructions to illustrate our theory in two dimensions. For our reconstructions, we need to compute the adjoint of the Herglotz wave function as an operator mapping into $H^1$ of a small ball.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Times for Transport Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many transport processes in ecology, physics and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here, we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker-Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modelling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as wolf movement in a forest habitat that is crossed by seismic lines.</description>

      <title>Concentration and oscillation analysis of positive solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with exponential growth in a disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a series of concentration and oscillation estimates for elliptic equations with exponential nonlinearity $e^{u^p}$ in a disc. Especially, we show various new results on the supercritical case $p&gt;2$ which are left open in the previous works. We begin with the concentration analysis of blow-up solutions by extending the scaling and pointwise techniques developed in the previous studies. A striking result is that we detect an infinite sequence of bubbles in the supercritical case $p&gt;2$. The precise characterization of the limit profile, energy, and location of each bubble is given. Moreover, we arrive at a natural interpretation, the infinite sequence of bubbles causes the infinite oscillation of the solutions. Based on this idea and our concentration estimates, we next carry out the oscillation analysis. The results allow us to estimate intersection points and numbers between blow-up solutions and singular functions. Applying this, we finally demonstrate the infinite oscillations of the bifurcation diagrams of supercritical equations. In addition, we also discuss what happens on the sequences of bubbles in the limit cases $p\to 2^+$ and $p\to \infty$ respectively. As above, the present work discovers a direct path connecting the concentration and oscillation analyses. It leads to a consistent and straightforward understanding of concentration, oscillation, and bifurcation phenomena on blow-up solutions of supercritical problems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new variational approach to finding multiple critical points for strongly indefinite problems without assuming the weak upper semicontinuity on the variational functionals. By this approach, we obtain the existence of infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions for a stationary periodic Schr\"odinger equation, in which the linear part is strongly indefinite and the nonlinear term is allowed to change sign in general ways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove geometric upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion i.e. extended Wentzell-type boundary condition under general curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. The method is based on an interpolation involving energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold. As side results we obtain explicit geometric bounds on the first nontrivial Steklov eigenvalue, for the norm of the boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions, and on the boundary trace logarithmic Sobolev constant. The case of Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection is also treated.</description>
