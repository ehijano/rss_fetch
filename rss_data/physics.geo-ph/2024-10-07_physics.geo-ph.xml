      <title>A Framework for Automatic Validation and Application of Lossy Data Compression in Ensemble Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble data assimilation techniques form an indispensable part of numerical weather prediction. As the ensemble size grows and model resolution increases, the amount of required storage becomes a major issue. Data compression schemes may come to the rescue not only for operational weather prediction, but also for weather history archives. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an easy-to-use framework for evaluating the impact of lossy data compression in large scale ensemble data assimilation. The framework leverages robust statistical qualifiers to determine which compression parameters can be safely applied to the climate variables. Furthermore, our proposal can be used to apply the best parameters during operation, while monitoring data integrity. We perform an exemplary study on the Lorenz96 model to identify viable compression parameters and achieve a 1/3 saving in storage space and an effective speedup of 6% per assimilation cycle, while monitoring the state integrity.</description>

      <title>Detection of a space capsule entering Earth's atmosphere with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 24 September 2023, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) Sample Return Capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere after successfully collecting samples from an asteroid. The known trajectory and timing of this return provided a rare opportunity to strategically instrument sites to record geophysical signals produced by the capsule as it traveled at hypersonic speeds through the atmosphere. We deployed two optical-fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) interrogators to sample over 12 km of surface-draped, fiber-optic cables along with six co-located seismometer-infrasound sensor pairs, spread across two sites near Eureka, NV. This campaign-style rapid deployment is the first reported recording of a sample return capsule entry with any distributed fiber optic sensing technology. The DAS interrogators recorded an impulsive arrival with an extended coda which had features that were similar to recordings from both the seismometers and infrasound sensors. While the signal-to-noise of the DAS data was lower than the seismic-infrasound data, the extremely dense spacing of fiber-optic sensors allowed for more phases to be clearly distinguished and the continuous transformation of the wavefront as it impacted the ground could be visualized. Unexpectedly, the DAS recordings contain less low-frequency content than is present in both the seismic and infrasound data. The deployment conditions strongly affected the recorded DAS data, in particular, we observed that fiber selection and placement exert strong controls on data quality.</description>

      <title>Force balances in spherical shell rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in understanding planetary core dynamics using numerical models of rotating convection (RC) in spherical shell geometry. However, the behaviour of forces in these models within various dynamic regimes of RC remains largely unknown. Directional anisotropy, scale dependence, and the role of dynamically irrelevant gradient contributions in incompressible flows complicate the representation of dynamical balances. In this study, we systematically compare integrated and scale-dependent representations of mean and fluctuation forces and curled forces (which contain no gradient contributions) separately for the three components ($\hat{r},\hat{\theta},\hat{\phi}$). The analysis is performed with simulations in a range of convective supercriticality $Ra/Ra_c=1.2-1967$ and Ekman number $E=10^{-3}-10^{-6}$, with fixed Prandtl number $Pr=1$, no-slip and fixed flux boundaries. We exclude $10$ velocity boundary layers from the spherical shell boundaries, to get a consistent representation of the dynamics between the force and curled force balance. Radial, azimuthal and co-latitudinal components exhibit distinct balances. The total magnitudes of the mean forces and mean curled forces exhibit a primary thermal wind (TW) balance; the corresponding fluctuating forces are in a quasi-geostrophic (QG) primary balance, while the fluctuating curled forces transition from a Viscous-Archimedean-Coriolis balance to an Inertia-Viscous-Archimedean-Coriolis balance with increasing $Ra/Ra_c$. The curled force balances are weakly scale-dependent compared to the forces and do not show clear cross-over scales. The fluctuating force and curled force balances are consistent with three regimes of RC (weakly nonlinear, rapidly rotating, and weakly rotating), but do not exhibit sharp changes with $Ra/Ra_c$, which inhibits the identification of precise regime boundaries from these balances.</description>
