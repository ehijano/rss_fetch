      <title>Floor, ceiling and the space between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a question posed in Problem 27327 from Gazeta Matematic\u{a}, we investigate the precise ranges of functions dependent on a real parameter and defined via the floor of a real number. Our findings reveal that determining these ranges necessitates non-trivial tools, including the Kronecker approximation theorem. Our results emphasize the deep distinctions among irrational parameters and contrast the behavior of sub-unitary and supra-unitary rational parameters. We also propose several conjectures related to irrational numbers and supra-unitary rational ones, supported by extensive computations using Wolfram Mathematica.</description>

      <title>The Admittance Matrix and Network Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This overview presents a collection of results from classical electrical network theory concerning properties of the network admittance matrix, and the relationship between electrical characteristics of the network and various mathematical properties of the admittance matrix. The derivation of standard circuit theorems taught to electrical engineers from properties of the admittance matrix and its cofactors is presented, and the determinant of the matrix is related to topological properties of the network. Later sections review key properties of DC and AC networks including monotonicity and orientability of DC networks, the impedance matrix for DC networks, and the extensions and limitations of these properties when translated to AC networks. It is shown that in general there is no impedance metric for AC networks extending that for DC networks but in many cases a form of semi-orientability can be exploited when analysing the AC power flow. The overview concludes with the derivation of standard properties of positive-real functions and impedance functions associated with AC networks, and of Thevenin and Norton equivalent sources for subnetworks.</description>

      <title>The Australian Vote: Transferable Voting, Its Limitations and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The voting systems known as Alternative Vote (AV) and Single Transferable Vote (STV) are extensively used for elections in Australia, possibly more than in any other jurisdiction. Often proposed as superior alternatives to Plurality and other common systems, they are also criticised by theoreticians for their vulnerability to paradoxical outcomes. It is argued these 'transferable voting' systems in fact operate to balance competing desiderata that attempt to distil the common notions of 'majority rule' and 'voter choice'. Among positive characteristics of AV is that its outcome is always a majority runoff between two candidates with substantial voter support, and that a Condorcet winner who gains at least one-third of votes is always elected. It is shown that in situations where a Condorcet winner is not elected, there always exists a monotonic shift producing a Condorcet cycle without changing the election outcome. A detailed analysis of non-monotonicity paradoxes in three-way contests is provided, aided by a two-dimensional spatial model where each candidate has a one-in-four probability of gaining an absolute majority of primary votes while there is a similar one-in-four probability that no candidate wins a majority. On such a model it is shown non-monotonicities are latent in less than 3.5% of election scenarios (and conjectured to be less than 3%), and the close link between non-monotonicities and Condorcet cycles and instabilities is studied in more detail. Properties of multi-winner STV are also reviewed including a demonstration of the standard fact that STV becomes similar to a form of largest-remainder list voting in the special case where ballots are cast strictly by party allegiance. The argument that AV and STV exemplify the principle of voter choice while balancing absolute and relative concepts of majority-rule is made by reference to practice in Australian elections.</description>

      <title>Integral Invariants and Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review and methodological article we discuss the main ideas of the integral invariants theory. This theory was originated by Poincare and Cartan. We show how ideas of this theory connect such different fields of mathematical physics as Hamiltonian dynamics, optics and hydrodynamics. We focus our attention on the results that are rarely expounded in the literature.</description>
