      <title>Coherent Audio-Visual Editing via Conditional Audio Generation Following Video Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel pipeline for joint audio-visual editing that enhances the coherence between edited video and its accompanying audio. Our approach first applies state-of-the-art video editing techniques to produce the target video, then performs audio editing to align with the visual changes. To achieve this, we present a new video-to-audio generation model that conditions on the source audio, target video, and a text prompt. We extend the model architecture to incorporate conditional audio input and propose a data augmentation strategy that improves training efficiency. Furthermore, our model dynamically adjusts the influence of the source audio based on the complexity of the edits, preserving the original audio structure where possible. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in maintaining audio-visual alignment and content integrity.</description>

      <title>DreamFoley: Scalable VLMs for High-Fidelity Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have achieved remarkable improvements in visual content fidelity. However, the absence of synchronized audio severely undermines immersive experience and restricts practical applications of these technologies. To address this challenge, several pioneering works have explored diffusion transformer architectures for generating plausible video-synchronized audio, including Kling-foley, HunyuanVideo-foley and Thinksound. Distinct from existing works, we introduce an autoregressive audio generation architecture (DreamFoley) that harnesses the capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly model sequential interactions among video, audio, and text modalities. Our approach features a dual-visual encoder module that effectively captures both audio-aligned and text-aligned visual features. Additionally, we employ a Residual Vector Quantization audio tokenizer with a delay-pattern generation scheme to balance the trade-off between training efficiency and audio quality. Moreover, we introduce the classifier-free guidance strategy into VLMs to bootstrap generated audio quality. Furthermore, we establish an efficient data production pipeline to scale audio-video-text triple collection. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our model, achieving promising performance across popular benchmarks. We hope that the findings in this study provide a strong foundation for future video-to-audio generation research. We also release the previously missing audio-visual textual descriptions from the public benchmark, aiming to facilitate subsequent researchers in conducting more convenient and effective evaluations and comparisons.</description>

      <title>A Sleep Monitoring System Based on Audio, Video and Depth Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantitative evaluation of sleep disturbances, a noninvasive monitoring system is developed by introducing an event-based method. We observe sleeping in home context and classify the sleep disturbances into three types of events: motion events, light-on/off events and noise events. A device with an infrared depth sensor, a RGB camera, and a four-microphone array is used in sleep monitoring in an environment with barely light sources. One background model is established in depth signals for measuring magnitude of movements. Because depth signals cannot observe lighting changes, another background model is established in color images for measuring magnitude of lighting effects. An event detection algorithm is used to detect occurrences of events from the processed data of the three types of sensors. The system was tested in sleep condition and the experiment result validates the system reliability.</description>

      <title>RMAdapter: Reconstruction-based Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \textit{e.g.} CLIP, have become essential tools in multimodal transfer learning. However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method to Enhance Pre-trained Language Models with Speech Tokens for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple method that allows to easily enhance textual pre-trained large language models with speech information, when fine-tuned for a specific classification task. A classical issue with the fusion of many embeddings from audio with text is the large length of the audio sequence compared to the text one. Our method benefits from an existing speech tokenizer trained for Audio Speech Recognition that output long sequences of tokens from a large vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate it at low cost in a large language model. By applying a simple lasso-based feature selection on multimodal Bag-of-Words representation, we retain only the most important audio tokens for the task, and adapt the language model to them with a self-supervised language modeling objective, before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. We show this helps to improve the performances compared to an unimodal model, to a bigger SpeechLM or to integrating audio via a learned representation. We show the effectiveness of our method on two recent Argumentative Fallacy Detection and Classification tasks where the use of audio was believed counterproductive, reaching state-of-the-art results. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the method, showing that even a random audio token selection helps enhancing the unimodal model. Our code is available [online](https://github.com/salocinc/EACL26SpeechTokFallacy/).</description>

      <title>MAVERIX: Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal audiovisual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX), a unified benchmark to probe the video understanding in multimodal LLMs, encompassing video, audio, text inputs with human performance baselines. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to thoroughly assess their cross-modality comprehension performance. MAVERIX curates 2,556 questions from 700 videos, in the form of both multiple-choice and open-ended formats, explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through questions that necessitate tight integration of video and audio information, spanning a broad spectrum of agentic scenarios. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual questions, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration in such granularity. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Qwen 2.5 Omni and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, show performance around 64% accuracy, while human experts reach near-ceiling performance of 92.8%, exposing a substantial gap to human-level comprehension. With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</description>

      <title>SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-guided and Personalized Music Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided editing methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes. However, these methods often struggle to preserve the musical content. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that improve the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality.</description>
