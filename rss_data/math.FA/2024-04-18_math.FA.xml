      <title>Corrigendum to "Applications of Strassen's theorem and Choquet theory to optimal transport problems, to uniformly convex functions and to uniformly smooth functions"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [K.J. Ciosmak, Applications of Strassen's theorem and Choquet theory to optimal transport problems, to uniformly convex functions and to uniformly smooth functions, Nonlinear Anal. 232 (2023), Paper No. 113267, 32 pp.], Theorem 2.3. does not suffice for its applications. We strengthen Theorem 2.1. and Theorem 2.3., so that they imply their claimed consequences. Moreover, we correct a minor flaw in the proof of Proposition 2.4..</description>

      <title>Metric Sobolev spaces I: equivalence of definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several notions of metric Sobolev space and on their equivalence. More precisely, we give a systematic presentation of first-order $p$-Sobolev spaces, with $p\in[1,\infty)$, defined over a complete and separable metric space equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. We focus on three different approaches: via approximation with Lipschitz functions; by studying the behaviour along curves, in terms either of the curve modulus or of test plans; via integration-by-parts, using Lipschitz derivations with divergence. Eventually, we show that all these approaches are fully equivalent. We emphasise that no doubling or Poincar\'{e} assumption is made, and that we allow also for the exponent $p=1$.
  A substantial part of this work consists of a self-contained and partially-revisited exposition of known results, which are scattered across the existing literature, but it contains also several new results, mostly concerning the equivalence of metric Sobolev spaces for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Separating diameter two properties from their weak-star counterparts in spaces of Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address some open problems concerning Banach spaces of real-valued Lipschitz functions. Specifically, we prove that the diameter two properties differ from their weak-star counterparts in these spaces. In particular, we establish the existence of dual Banach spaces lacking the symmetric strong diameter two property but possessing its weak-star counterpart. We show that there exists an octahedral Lipschitz-free space whose bidual is not octahedral. Furthermore, we prove that the Banach space of real-valued Lipschitz functions from any infinite subset of $\ell_1$ possesses the symmetric strong diameter two property. These results are achieved by introducing new sufficient conditions, providing new examples and clarifying the status of known ones.</description>

      <title>Allocation Mechanisms in Decentralized Exchange Markets with Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical theory of efficient allocations of an aggregate endowment in a pure-exchange economy has hitherto primarily focused on the Pareto-efficiency of allocations, under the implicit assumption that transfers between agents are frictionless, and hence costless to the economy. In this paper, we argue that certain transfers cause frictions that result in costs to the economy. We show that these frictional costs are tantamount to a form of subadditivity of the cost of transferring endowments between agents. We suggest an axiomatic study of allocation mechanisms, that is, the mechanisms that transform feasible allocations into other feasible allocations, in the presence of such transfer costs. Among other results, we provide an axiomatic characterization of those allocation mechanisms that admit representations as robust (worst-case) linear allocation mechanisms, as well as those mechanisms that admit representations as worst-case conditional expectations. We call the latter Robust Conditional Mean Allocation mechanisms, and we relate our results to the literature on (decentralized) risk sharing within a pool of agents.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analytic approach to exceptional set estimates for orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marstrand's celebrated projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. It is straightforward to see that sets for which the Fourier and Hausdorff dimension coincide have no exceptional projections, that is, \emph{all} orthogonal projections satisfy the conclusion of Marstrand's theorem. With this in mind, one might believe that the Fourier dimension (or at least, Fourier decay) could be used to give better estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set in general. We obtain projection theorems and exceptional set estimates based on the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. We apply these results to show that the Fourier spectrum can be used to improve several results for the Hausdorff dimension in certain cases, such as Ren--Wang's sharp bound for the exceptional set in the plane, Peres--Schlag's exceptional set bound and Bourgain--Oberlin's sharp $0$-dimensional exceptional set estimate.</description>

      <title>On the relaxation to equilibrium of a quantum oscillator interacting with a radiation field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate from the point of view of spectral theory the problem of relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a radiation field. Our starting point is a system of infinitely many Pauli master equations governing the time evolution of the occupation probabilities of the available quantum states. The system we consider is derived from the evolution equation for the reduced density operator obtained after the initial interaction of the oscillator with the radiation field, the latter acting as a heat bath. We provide a complete spectral analysis of the infinitesimal generator of the equations, showing thereby that it generates an infinite-dimensional system of hyperbolic type. This implies that every global solution to the equations converge exponentially rapidly toward the corresponding Gibbs equilibrium state. We also provide a complete spectral analysis of a linear pencil naturally associated with the Pauli equations. All of our considerations revolve around the notion of compactness, more specifically around the existence of a new compact embedding result involving a space of sequences of Sobolev type into a weighted space of square-integrable summable sequences.</description>

Abstract: We present complete classifications of paired operators on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ and Toeplitz + Hankel operators on vector-valued Hardy spaces. We introduce the notion of inner-paired operators defined on the Hardy space that use the classical model spaces. We fully classify inner-paired operators.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for place dependent idempotent iterated function systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the set of invariant idempotent probabilities for place dependent idempotent iterated function systems defined in compact metric spaces. Using well-known ideas from dynamical systems, such as the Ma\~{n}\'{e} potential and the Aubry set, we provide a complete characterization of the densities of such idempotent probabilities. As an application, we provide an alternative formula for the attractor of a class of fuzzy iterated function systems.</description>

      <title>On Neumann-Poincar\'e operators and self-adjoint transmission problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the self-adjointness in $L^2$-setting of the operators acting as $-\nabla\cdot h\nabla$, with piecewise constant functions $h$ having a jump along a Lipschitz hypersurface $\Sigma$, without explicit assumptions on the sign of $h$. We establish a number of sufficient conditions for the self-adjointness of the operator with $H^s$-regularity for suitable $s\in[1,\frac{3}{2}]$, in terms of the jump value and the regularity and geometric properties of $\Sigma$. An important intermediate step is a link with Fredholm properties of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on $\Sigma$, which is new for the Lipschitz setting.</description>

      <title>General Higher Order $L^p$ Mean Zonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the higher-order difference body and the associated Rogers-Shephard inequality. Recently, Haddad, Langharst, Putterman, Roysdon and Ye expanded the concept to a burgeoning higher-order Brunn-Minkowski theory. In 1991, Zhang introduced mean zonoids of a convex body, which was extended to the Firey-Brunn-Minkowski theory setting by Xi, Guo and Leng in 2014. In this note, we extend these $L^p$ mean zonoids to the higher-order setting and establish the associated isoperimetric inequality.</description>
