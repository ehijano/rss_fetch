      <title>Explainable Patterns in Cryptocurrency Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We document stable cross-asset patterns in cryptocurrency limit-order-book microstructure: the same engineered order book and trade features exhibit remarkably similar predictive importance and SHAP dependence shapes across assets spanning an order of magnitude in market capitalization (BTC, LTC, ETC, ENJ, ROSE). The data covers Binance Futures perpetual contract order books and trades on 1-second frequency starting from January 1st, 2022 up to October 12th, 2025. Using a unified CatBoost modeling pipeline with a direction-aware GMADL objective and time-series cross validation, we show that feature rankings and partial effects are stable across assets despite heterogeneous liquidity and volatility. We connect these SHAP structures to microstructure theory (order flow imbalance, spread, and adverse selection) and validate tradability via a conservative top-of-book taker backtest as well as fixed depth maker backtest. Our primary novelty is a robustness analysis of a major flash crash, where the divergent performance of our taker and maker strategies empirically validates classic microstructure theories of adverse selection and highlights the systemic risks of algorithmic trading. Our results suggest a portable microstructure representation of short-horizon returns and motivate universal feature libraries for crypto markets.</description>

      <title>Design and Empirical Study of a Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Investment System for Chinese Public REITs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the low-volatility Chinese Public Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) market, proposing a large language model (LLM)-driven trading framework based on multi-agent collaboration. The system constructs four types of analytical agents-announcement, event, price momentum, and market-each conducting analysis from different dimensions; then the prediction agent integrates these multi-source signals to output directional probability distributions across multiple time horizons, then the decision agent generates discrete position adjustment signals based on the prediction results and risk control constraints, thereby forming a closed loop of analysis-prediction-decision-execution. This study further compares two prediction model pathways: for the prediction agent, directly calling the general-purpose large model DeepSeek-R1 versus using a specialized small model Qwen3-8B fine-tuned via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alignment. In the backtest from October 2024 to October 2025, both agent-based strategies significantly outperformed the buy-and-hold benchmark in terms of cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The results indicate that the multi-agent framework can effectively enhance the risk-adjusted return of REITs trading, and the fine-tuned small model performs close to or even better than the general-purpose large model in some scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Formal Approach to AMM Fee Mechanisms with Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized financial markets by enabling complex asset-exchange protocols without trusted intermediaries. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a central component of DeFi, providing the core functionality of swapping assets of different types at algorithmically computed exchange rates. Several mainstream AMM implementations are based on the constant-product model, which ensures that swaps preserve the product of the token reserves in the AMM -- up to a \emph{trading fee} used to incentivize liquidity provision. Trading fees substantially complicate the economic properties of AMMs, and for this reason some AMM models abstract them away in order to simplify the analysis. However, trading fees have a non-trivial impact on users' trading strategies, making it crucial to develop refined AMM models that precisely account for their effects. We extend a foundational model of AMMs by introducing a new parameter, the trading fee $\phi\in(0,1]$, into the swap rate function. Fee amounts increase inversely proportional to $\phi$. When $\phi = 1$, no fee is applied and the original model is recovered. We analyze the resulting fee-adjusted model from an economic perspective. We show that several key properties of the swap rate function, including output-boundedness and monotonicity, are preserved. At the same time, other properties - most notably additivity - no longer hold. We precisely characterize this deviation by deriving a generalized form of additivity that captures the effect of swaps in the presence of trading fees. We prove that when $\phi &lt; 1$, executing a single large swap yields strictly greater profit than splitting the trade into smaller ones. Finally, we derive a closed-form solution to the arbitrage problem in the presence of trading fees and prove its uniqueness. All results are formalized and machine-checked in the Lean 4 proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Trading Electrons: Predicting DART Spread Spikes in ISO Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of forecasting and optimally trading day-ahead versus real-time (DART) price spreads in U.S. wholesale electricity markets. Building on the framework of Galarneau-Vincent et al., we extend spike prediction from a single zone to a multi-zone setting and treat both positive and negative DART spikes within a unified statistical model. To translate directional signals into economically meaningful positions, we develop a structural and market-consistent price impact model based on day-ahead bid stacks. This yields closed-form expressions for the optimal vector of zonal INC/DEC quantities, capturing asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone congestion effects. When applied to NYISO, the resulting impact-aware strategy significantly improves the risk-return profile relative to unit-size trading and highlights substantial heterogeneity across markets and seasons.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</description>
