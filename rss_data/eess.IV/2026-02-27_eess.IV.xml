      <title>Deep Accurate Solver for the Geodesic Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to compute distances on continuous surfaces is by considering a discretized polygonal mesh approximating the surface and estimating distances on the polygon. We show that exact geodesic distances restricted to the polygon are at most second-order accurate with respect to the distances on the corresponding continuous surface. By order of accuracy we refer to the convergence rate as a function of the average distance between sampled points. Next, a higher-order accurate deep learning method for computing geodesic distances on surfaces is introduced. Traditionally, one considers two main components when computing distances on surfaces: a numerical solver that locally approximates the distance function, and an efficient causal ordering scheme by which surface points are updated. Classical minimal path methods often exploit a dynamic programming principle with quasi-linear computational complexity in the number of sampled points. The quality of the distance approximation is determined by the local solver that is revisited in this paper. To improve state of the art accuracy, we consider a neural network-based local solver which implicitly approximates the structure of the continuous surface. We supply numerical evidence that the proposed learned update scheme provides better accuracy compared to the best possible polyhedral approximations and previous learning-based methods. The result is a third-order accurate solver with a bootstrapping-recipe for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Learning to reconstruct from saturated data: audio declipping and high-dynamic range imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning based methods are now ubiquitous for solving inverse problems, but their deployment in real-world applications is often hindered by the lack of ground truth references for training. Recent self-supervised learning strategies offer a promising alternative, avoiding the need for ground truth. However, most existing methods are limited to linear inverse problems. This work extends self-supervised learning to the non-linear problem of recovering audio and images from clipped measurements, by assuming that the signal distribution is approximately invariant to changes in amplitude. We provide sufficient conditions for learning to reconstruct from saturated signals alone and a self-supervised loss that can be used to train reconstruction networks. Experiments on both audio and image data show that the proposed approach is almost as effective as fully supervised approaches, despite relying solely on clipped measurements for training.</description>

      <title>HARU-Net: Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net for Edge-Preserving Denoising in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dental and maxillofacial imaging, but low-dose acquisition introduces strong, spatially varying noise that degrades soft-tissue visibility and obscures fine anatomical structures. Classical denoising methods struggle to suppress noise in CBCT while preserving edges. Although deep learning-based approaches offer high-fidelity restoration, their use in CBCT denoising is limited by the scarcity of high-resolution CBCT data for supervised training. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net (HARU-Net) for high-quality denoising of CBCT data, trained on a cadaver dataset of human hemimandibles acquired using a high-resolution protocol of the 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) CBCT system. The novel contribution of this approach is the integration of three complementary architectural components: (i) a hybrid attention transformer block (HAB) embedded within each skip connection to selectively emphasize salient anatomical features, (ii) a residual hybrid attention transformer group (RHAG) at the bottleneck to strengthen global contextual modeling and long-range feature interactions, and (iii) residual learning convolutional blocks to facilitate deeper, more stable feature extraction throughout the network. HARU-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including SwinIR and Uformer, achieving the highest PSNR (37.52 dB), highest SSIM (0.9557), and lowest GMSD (0.1084). This effective and clinically reliable CBCT denoising is achieved at a computational cost significantly lower than that of the SOTA methods, offering a practical advancement toward improving diagnostic quality in low-dose CBCT imaging.</description>

      <title>U-Net-Based Generative Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) methods have achieved remarkable success in wireless image transmission. However, these methods either focus on conventional distortion metrics that do not necessarily yield high perceptual quality or incur high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two DL-based JSCC (DeepJSCC) methods that leverage deep generative architectures for wireless image transmission. Specifically, we propose G-UNet-JSCC, a scheme comprising an encoder and a U-Net-based generator serving as the decoder. Its skip connections enable multi-scale feature fusion to improve both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual quality of reconstructed images by integrating low- and high-level features. To further enhance pixel-level fidelity, the encoder and the U-Net-based decoder are jointly optimized using a weighted sum of structural similarity and mean-squared error (MSE) losses. Building upon G-UNet-JSCC, we further develop a DeepJSCC method called cGAN-JSCC, where the decoder is enhanced through adversarial training. In this scheme, we retain the encoder of G-UNet-JSCC and adversarially train the decoder's generator against a patch-based discriminator. cGAN-JSCC employs a two-stage training procedure. The outer stage trains the encoder and the decoder end-to-end using an MSE loss, while the inner stage adversarially trains the decoder's generator and the discriminator by minimizing a joint loss combining adversarial and distortion losses. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve superior pixel-level fidelity and perceptual quality on both high- and low-resolution images. For low-resolution images, cGAN-JSCC achieves better reconstruction performance and greater robustness to channel variations than G-UNet-JSCC.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Denoising of Diffusion-Weighted Images with Bias and Variance Corrected Noise Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) plays a vital role in both clinical diagnostics and neuroscience research. However, its inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially under high diffusion weighting, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream analysis. Recent self-supervised and unsupervised denoising methods offer a practical solution by enhancing image quality without requiring clean references. However, most of these methods do not explicitly account for the non-Gaussian noise characteristics commonly present in dMRI magnitude data during the supervised learning process, potentially leading to systematic bias and heteroscedastic variance, particularly under low-SNR conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce noise-corrected training objectives that explicitly model Rician statistics. Specifically, we propose two alternative loss functions: one derived from the first-order moment to remove mean bias, and another from the second-order moment to correct squared-signal bias. Both losses include adaptive weighting to account for variance heterogeneity and can be used without changing the network architecture. These objectives are instantiated in an image-specific, unsupervised Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and in-vivo dMRI show that the proposed losses effectively reduce Rician bias and suppress noise fluctuations, yielding higher image quality and more reliable diffusion metrics than state-of-the-art denoising baselines. These results underscore the importance of bias- and variance-aware noise modeling for robust dMRI analysis under low-SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>CryoNet.Refine: A One-step Diffusion Model for Rapid Refinement of Structural Models with Cryo-EM Density Map Restraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) requires the accurate fitting of an atomic model into an experimental density map. Traditional refinement pipelines such as Phenix.real_space_refine and Rosetta are computationally expensive, demand extensive manual tuning, and present a significant bottleneck for researchers. We present CryoNet.Refine, an end-to-end deep learning framework that automates and accelerates molecular structure refinement. Our approach utilizes a one-step diffusion model that integrates a density-aware loss function with robust stereochemical restraints, enabling rapid optimization of a structure against experimental data. CryoNet.Refine provides a unified and versatile solution capable of refining protein complexes as well as DNA/RNA-protein complexes. In benchmarks against Phenix.real_space_refine, CryoNet.Refine consistently achieves substantial improvements in both model-map correlation and overall geometric quality metrics. By offering a scalable, automated, and powerful alternative, CryoNet.Refine aims to serve as an essential tool for next-generation cryo-EM structure refinement.

      <title>An automatic counting algorithm for the quantification and uncertainty analysis of the number of microglial cells trainable in small and heterogeneous datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting immunopositive cells on biological tissues generally requires either manual annotation or (when available) automatic rough systems, for scanning signal surface and intensity in whole slide imaging. In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Diffusion Meets ADMM: Dual-Variable Coupling for Robust Medical Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.</description>

      <title>LinGuinE: Longitudinal Guidance Estimation for Volumetric Tumour Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longitudinal volumetric tumour segmentation is critical for radiotherapy planning and response assessment, yet this problem is underexplored and most methods produce single-timepoint semantic masks, lack lesion correspondence, and offer limited radiologist control. We introduce LinGuinE (Longitudinal Guidance Estimation), a PyTorch framework that combines image registration and guided segmentation to deliver lesion-level tracking and volumetric masks across all scans in a longitudinal study from a single radiologist prompt. LinGuinE is temporally direction agnostic, requires no training on longitudinal data, and allows any registration and semi-automatic segmentation algorithm to be repurposed for the task. We evaluate various combinations of registration and segmentation algorithms within the framework. LinGuinE achieves state-of-the-art segmentation and tracking performance across four datasets with a total of 456 longitudinal studies. Tumour segmentation performance shows minimal degradation with increasing temporal separation. We conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of autoregression, pathology specific finetuning, and the use of real radiologist prompts. We release our code and substantial public benchmarking for longitudinal segmentation, facilitating future research.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron: An Energy-Efficient Functional Unit for Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new, highly energy-efficient, Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron (ACN) hardware implementation of an Artificial Neuron (AN) with improved functionality, accuracy, robustness and scalability over previous work. The paper describes the implementation of a \mbox{12-bit} single neuron, with positive and negative weight support, in an $\mathbf{0.18\mu m}$ CMOS technology. The paper also presents a new Threshold Logic (TL) design for a binary AN activation function that generates a low symmetrical offset across three process corners and five temperatures between $-55^o$C and $125^o$C. Post-layout simulations demonstrate a maximum rising and falling offset voltage of 9$mV$ compared to conventional TL, which has rising and falling offset voltages of 27$mV$ and 5$mV$ respectively, across temperature and process. Moreover, the proposed TL design shows a decrease in average energy of 1.5$\%$ at the SS corner and 2.3$\%$ at FF corner compared to the conventional TL design. The total synapse energy saving for the proposed ACN was above 90$\%$ (over 12x improvement) when compared to a non-adiabatic CMOS Capacitive Neuron (CCN) benchmark for a frequency ranging from 500$kHz$ to 100$MHz$. A 1000-sample Monte Carlo simulation including process variation and mismatch confirms the worst-case energy savings of $\&gt;$90$\%$ compared to CCN in the synapse energy profile. Finally, the impact of supply voltage scaling shows consistent energy savings of above 90$\%$ (except all zero inputs) without loss of functionality.</description>

      <title>Automated Disentangling Analysis of Skin Colour for Lesion Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning models applied to skin images often have degraded performance when the skin colour captured in images (SCCI) differs between training and deployment. These discrepancies arise from a combination of entangled environmental factors (e.g., illumination, camera settings) and intrinsic factors (e.g., skin tone) that cannot be accurately described by a single "skin tone" scalar -- a simplification commonly adopted by prior work. To mitigate such colour mismatches, we propose a skin-colour disentangling framework that adapts disentanglement-by-compression to learn a structured, manipulable latent space for SCCI from unlabelled dermatology images. To prevent information leakage that hinders proper learning of dark colour features, we introduce a randomized, mostly monotonic decolourization mapping. To suppress unintended colour shifts of localized patterns (e.g., ink marks, scars) during colour manipulation, we further propose a geometry-aligned post-processing step. Together, these components enable faithful counterfactual editing and answering an essential question: "What would this skin condition look like under a different SCCI?", as well as direct colour transfer between images and controlled traversal along physically meaningful directions (e.g., blood perfusion, camera white balance), enabling educational visualization of skin conditions under varying SCCI. We demonstrate that dataset-level augmentation and colour normalization based on our framework achieve competitive lesion classification performance. Ultimately, our work promotes equitable diagnosis through creating diverse training datasets that include different skin tones and image-capturing conditions.</description>

      <title>Atlas-free Brain Network Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current atlas-based approaches to brain network analysis rely heavily on standardized anatomical or connectivity-driven brain atlases. However, these fixed atlases often introduce significant limitations, such as spatial misalignment across individuals, functional heterogeneity within predefined regions, and atlas-selection biases, collectively undermining the reliability and interpretability of the derived brain networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel atlas-free brain network transformer (atlas-free BNT) that leverages individualized brain parcellations derived directly from subject-specific resting-state fMRI data. Our approach computes ROI-to-voxel connectivity features in a standardized voxel-based feature space, which are subsequently processed using the BNT architecture to produce comparable subject-level embeddings. Experimental evaluations on sex classification and brain-connectome age prediction tasks demonstrate that our atlas-free BNT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art atlas-based methods, including elastic net, BrainGNN, Graphormer and the original BNT. Our atlas-free approach significantly improves the precision, robustness, and generalizability of brain network analyses. This advancement holds great potential to enhance neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical diagnostic tools for personalized precision medicine.
