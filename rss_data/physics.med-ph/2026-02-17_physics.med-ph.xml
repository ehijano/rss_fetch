      <title>Biocompatibility of Additively Manufactured Fe-AZ31 Biodegradable Composites for Craniofacial Implant Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic plating systems composed of titanium and its alloys remain the standard treatment for craniofacial bony fixation but may require secondary removal due to infection, implant migration, or discomfort. Thus, biodegradable metallic implants may eliminate complications and secondary procedures while maintaining structural integrity. Our previous work demonstrated the fabrication of immiscible Fe-AZ31 composites via additive manufacturing with improved degradation kinetics over pure Iron. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of Fe-AZ31 composites for potential craniofacial fixation applications. Pure iron (Fe), Mg alloy (AZ31) and Fe-AZ31 samples were fabricated for extract-based cytotoxicity testing using HFF-1 fibroblasts, L929 fibroblasts and hFOB osteoblasts. Metal extracts were prepared at a 3 cm^2/mL surface-to-volume ratio in complete media at 37C and cell viability was measured by live/dead assay after 24 and 72h exposure. For in vivo evaluation, Fe-AZ31, Fe, and Ti plates were implanted subcutaneously in wild type mice for 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. Implant degradation, histologic response, hematology, and serum biochemistry were assessed. Fe-AZ31 extracts demonstrated &gt;70% cell viability across all cell types at both timepoints with normal cell morphology and adhesion, whereas AZ31 extracts caused marked cytotoxicity associated with pronounced alkalization (pH 10). In vivo, Fe-AZ31 implants exhibited gradual surface corrosion accompanied by mild, transient inflammation and minimal capsule formation over time. No systemic toxicity was observed. Hematology and serum biochemistry remained within physiological limits. Additively manufactured Fe-AZ31 composites demonstrate acceptable biocompatibility and favorable tissue responses, supporting their development as resorbable metallic fixation devices for craniofacial reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Complex Wavelet-Based Sinogram Segmentation for Metal Artifact Reduction in Cone-Beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal objects pose a significant challenge in cone-beam computed tomography, as their strong and energy-dependent X-ray attenuation leads to inconsistent projections and severe streaking and shading artifacts in reconstructed images. These artifacts degrade image quality and limit the reliability of subsequent medical analysis. We propose a projection-domain metal artifact reduction method based on analytical metal segmentation in the three-dimensional sinogram using the three-dimensional Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform, where directional wavelet coefficients are exploited to extract the wavefront set and singular support of metal structures. The resulting segmentation enables projection-domain inpainting and artifact-reduced reconstruction by combining metal-free and metal-only reconstructions. The proposed approach is evaluated on both simulated and clinical cone-beam computed tomography data and consistently reduces metal artifacts compared to conventional image-domain hard-thresholding methods. The results demonstrate improved visual quality and robustness in clinically realistic scenarios, highlighting the potential of analytically grounded, non-learned projection-domain segmentation for metal artifact reduction.</description>

      <title>Increasing ultrasound field-of-view with reduced element count arrays containing large elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several applications of medical ultrasound can benefit from a larger imaging field of view (FOV). This study is aimed at increasing the FOV of linear array probes by increasing the element size rather than the element count. To investigate larger FOV, this study used coupled elements to imitate a larger element size. The effects of coupling on array beam patterns are examined with Fourier transforms of elements. The effects of coupling on resolution, contrast, and speckle signal-to-noise ratio are examined through phantom images and in-vivo images of a rabbit tumor reconstructed with plane-wave compounding. Furthermore, a positioning system was used to acquire data from a virtual large aperture with 120 mm FOV and 128 elements, collected in sections with a single probe. This study also investigates the Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), Sign Coherence Factor (SCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers for regaining resolution lost by an increased F-number with large elements. The MV beamformer, while the most computationally expensive, was best for improving resolution without increasing speckle variance, decreasing Full-Width at Half-Max (FWHM) estimates of wire targets from 0.78 mm with DAS on a 2.5 wavelength element size to 0.54 mm with MV on a 5 wavelength element size.</description>

      <title>Biomechanics of the abdominal wall before and after ventral hernia repair using dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the use of dynamic MRI to assess abdominal wall biomechanics before and after hernia surgery, considering that such evaluations can enhance our understanding of physiopathology and contribute to reducing recurrence rates. Methods: Patients were assessed using dynamic MRI in axial and sagittal planes while performing exercises (breathing, coughing, Valsalva) before and after their abdominal hernia surgery with mesh placement. Rectus and lateral muscles, linea alba, viscera area, defect dimensions and hernia sac were contoured with semi-automatic process to quantify the abdominal wall biomechanical temporal modifications. Results: This study enrolled 11 patients. During coughing, the axial area of the hernia sac increased by 128.4 $\pm$ 199.2%. The sac increased similarly in axial and sagittal planes during Valsalva. Post-surgical evaluations showed a 26% reduction in inter-recti distance and a lengthening of all muscles (p $\le$ 0.05). The post-operative rectus abdominis thickness change was negatively correlated with defect width during breathing (p $\le$ 0.05). The largest change in linea alba displacement was observed in the surgical site (p = 0.07). Post-operatively, lateral muscles had a larger inward displacement during Valsalva (p $\le$ 0.05). Rectus abdominis had a larger outward displacement during breathing (p = 0.09), reduced with the mesh size (p $\le$ 0.05). A large inter-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Using a semi-automatic methodology, an in-depth analysis of the biomechanics of the abdominal wall was conducted, highlighting the importance of a patient-specific assessment. A broader study and consideration of recurrence would subsequently complete this methodological work.</description>

      <title>A physics inspired and efficient transform for optoacoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoacoustic imaging technologies still rely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the preferred method for essential signal conditioning operations. The long-standing success of the DFT is largely due to the limited generalizability of data-driven alternatives (e.g., deep neural networks) and the inconsistent accuracy of other analytical transforms (e.g., wavelet transforms).
  However, the DFT is a 'general-purpose' algorithm whose building blocks, when considered individually, are not directly related to the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. As a result, its accuracy can be limited. Moreover, the computational complexity of its modern algorithmic form imposes a hard limit on execution speed. This limitation may be particularly pronounced in advanced spectral systems that produce large data sets, preventing their adoption. Importantly, optoacoustic imaging technologies are increasingly impacting biological research while standing on the brink of widespread clinical adoption.
  We have devised a new transform whose building blocks are directly inspired by the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. We have compared its performance with the DFT and other classical transforms on typical signal processing tasks using both simulations and experimental data sets. Our results indicate that the proposed transform not only establishes a new lower bound in computational complexity relative to the DFT, but also strongly outperforms the classical transforms for basic signal processing operations in terms of accuracy metrics. We expect our new transform to catalyze the general adoption of optoacoustic methods.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Mediated Contagion: A Quantum Electrodynamics-Inspired Framework for Non-Local Epidemic Dynamics and Superdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a gauge-mediated Epidemiological Model inspired by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In this model, the ``direct contact'' paradigm of classical SIR models is replaced by a gauge-mediated interaction where the environment, represented by a pathogen field $\varphi$, plays a fundamental role in the epidemic dynamics. In this model, the non-local characteristics of epidemics appear naturally by integrating out the pathogen field. Utilizing the Doi-Peliti formalism, we derive the effective action of the system and the standard Feynman rules that can be used to compute perturbatively any observables. Using standard QED techniques, we show how to relate renormalized pathogen mass, Debye screening, to epidemiological concepts and we compute at first order the effective reproductive number,$R_{eff}$, and how the condition to have an epidemic is related to a phase transition in the pathogen mass. We show that the superspreading hosts can be included easily in this formalism.</description>

      <title>Magnetocardiography measurements using an optically pumped magnetometer under ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report the development of a rubidium-based single-beam scalar optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) and demonstrate its application in measuring human cardiac magnetic fields in an unshielded environment. The developed magnetometers exhibit a noise floor below 15 pT/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range of 1 to 35 Hz, with a measurement bandwidth of 100 Hz. When operated in a gradiometric configuration, the noise floor is further reduced to below 3 pT/sqrt(Hz) over the same frequency range. Magnetocardiography (MCG) signals were recorded at five different locations across the thorax. A clear polarity reversal of the QRS complex was observed across these measurement positions, confirming the spatial sensitivity of the system. The proposed system shows strong potential for clinical diagnostics, offering valuable physiological information through non-contact MCG measurements</description>

      <title>Controlling spatial correlation in k-space interpolation networks for MRI reconstruction: denoising versus apparent blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Interpretability is essential for the clinical adoption of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conventional evaluation of ML reconstructions relies heavily on aggregate image metrics that require fully sampled references. These metrics, inherited from classical image processing and natural image ML, often overlook the critical challenge of noise amplification specific to medical image reconstruction. This study aims to analyze the influence of nonlinear activations on spatial noise variance distribution of k-space interpolation networks (RAKI) and to provide a framework for incorporating variance maps during network training. Methods: We present an analytical framework that decomposes pixel-level noise variance into components reflecting linear and nonlinear characteristics of RAKI. By applying automatic differentiation on the image-space equivalent of the network, variance maps are computed during each training iteration, enabling runtime quality assessment beyond data consistency. We introduce apparent blurring, quantifying nonlinear signal mixing without dependence on reference images. By incorporating variance maps into the traning loss as regularizers, our self-informed RAKI architecture (G-factor-informed RAKI, GIF-RAKI) can directly integrate updated noise characteristics during runtime. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that variance components quantitatively explain network behavior. GIF-RAKI outperforms conventional RAKI variants in image fidelity and noise suppression. Conclusion: Our methodology advances practical and theoretical aspects of ML-based MRI reconstruction by reinstating reconstruction noise characterization as a cornerstone for performance evaluation, eliminating the need for fully sampled references. GIF-RAKI also enables optimization of the trade-off between denoising and apparent blurring.</description>

      <title>Synchro-Thermography: Monitoring ~10 mK Facial Temperature Changes with Heartbeat Referencing for Physiological Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity. Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.</description>

      <title>Causal machine learning reveals age-dependent radiation dose effects on mandibular osteoradionecrosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinguishing causal relationships from statistical correlations remains a fundamental challenge in clinical research, limiting the translation of observational findings into interventional treatment guidelines. Here we apply causal machine learning to establish causal effects of radiation dose parameters on mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) in 931 head and neck cancer patients treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy. Using generalized random forests, we demonstrate that all examined dosimetric factors exhibit significant positive causal effects on ORN development (average treatment effects: 0.092-0.141). Integration with explainable machine learning reveals substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, with patients aged 50-60 years showing the strongest causal dose-response relationships (conditional average treatment effects up to 0.229), while patients over 70 years demonstrate minimal effects. These results suggest that age-stratified treatment optimization and personalized treatment planning for the dosimetric factors could reduce ORN risk. Our findings demonstrate that causal inference methods can transform clinical retrospective radiotherapy data into personalized treatment recommendations, providing a methodological framework applicable to toxicity prediction across oncology and other clinical domains where treatment decisions depend on complex dose-response relationships.</description>

      <title>Depth-multiplexing spectral domain OCT for full eye length imaging with a single modulation unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical measurement of a patient's axial eye length is emerging as a crucial approach to track progression and monitor management of myopia. However, the preferred method for such measurements is swept-source OCT, whose cost prohibits broad use, especially in lower-income communities. Spectral domain (SD) OCT is a more affordable option, but it has limited imaging depth range, so is not suitable for full eye length measurement. Depth-multiplexing (DM) techniques for SD-OCT provide a workaround by capturing images at multiple depths within the eye. However, these methods typically require multiple light modulation units or detectors for simultaneous imaging across depths, adding complexity and cost. In response, we propose a novel DM-SD-OCT approach that utilizes a single light modulation unit for depth encoding. We capture images at multiple depths within the eye simultaneously with a single line scan camera, then computationally demix the contributions from different depths. Here, we demonstrate acquisition and demixing of signals from three distinct depths within the eye and validate experimentally in human subjects. Our method thus offers a cost-effective solution for comprehensive eye length measurement in clinical myopia research.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole liquid in biological tissues under ultra high dose rate ionizing radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.</description>
