      <title>Neural network assisted electrostatic global gyrokinetic toroidal code using cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulation codes are used to understand the microturbulence in the linear and nonlinear regimes of the tokamak and stellarator core. The codes that use flux coordinates to reduce computational complexities introduced by the anisotropy due to the presence of confinement magnetic fields encounter a mathematical singularity of the metric on the magnetic separatrix surface. To overcome this constraint, we develop a neural network-assisted Global Gyrokinetic Code using Cylindrical Coordinates (G2C3) to study the electrostatic microturbulence in realistic tokamak geometries. In particular, G2C3 uses a cylindrical coordinate system for particle dynamics, which allows particle motion in arbitrarily shaped flux surfaces, including the magnetic separatrix of the tokamak. We use an efficient particle locating hybrid scheme, which uses a neural network and iterative local search algorithm, for the charge deposition and field interpolation. G2C3 uses the field lines estimated by numerical integration to train the neural network in universal function approximator mode to speed up the subroutines related to gathering and scattering operations of gyrokinetic simulation. Finally, as verification of the capability of the new code, we present results from self-consistent simulations of linear ion temperature gradient modes in the core region of the DIII-D tokamak.</description>

      <title>Observation and characterisation of trapped electron modes in Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, quasi coherent modes were reported for nearly all tokamaks. The general definition describes modes as quasi coherent when the magnitude squared coherence is in the range of \SIrange{0.3}{0.6}{}. Quasi coherent modes are observed in the plasma core as well as in the plasma edge and can have quite different physical origins. The one in the core are observed in plasmas with low collisionality, where the electron temperature exceeds the ion temperature in the plasma core. This is the case for electron cyclotron heating in general. The origin of these modes are electrons trapped within a magnetic mirror, as reported in the past from various fusion devices. The so-called trapped-electron modes (TEMs) belong to drift wave instabilities and can be destabilized by electron-temperature gradients in the plasma core. From the diagnostic point of view, quasi coherent modes appear as fluctuations in electron density and temperature. Therefore, the microwave reflectometer is very well suited to monitor these modes. This paper describes experiments, conducted at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X), which aim at detecting quasi coherent modes at low wave numbers. A Poloidal Correlation Reflectometer (PCR) installed at W7-X, is able to measure low wave numbers ($k_\perp\le 3.5$ cm$^{-1}$). For different magnetic configurations and plasma parameters, broad quasi-coherent structures are observed in the coherence spectra. From the analysis of the rotation and the poloidal structure, these quasi coherent (QC) modes show the properties of electron-temperature-gradient driven TEMs. A linear relation between the mode velocity and the rotation frequency is found. The relation is uniform and confirms the nature of QC-mode observation as TEM in tokamaks, too.</description>

      <title>Beam focusing and consequences for Doppler Backscattering measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of beam focusing of microwaves in a plasma near a turning-point caustic is discussed in the context of the analytical solution to the Gaussian beam-tracing equations in the 2D linear-layer problem. The location of maximum beam focusing and the beam width at that location are studied in terms of the beam initial conditions. The analytic solution is used to study the effect of this focusing on Doppler backscattering (DBS). We find that the filter function that characterises the scattering intensity contributions along the beam path through the plasma is inversely proportional to the beam width, predicting enhanced scattering contributions from the beam focusing region. We show that the DBS signal enhancement for small incident angles between the beam path and the density gradient is due to beam focusing and not due to forward scattering. The analytic beam model is used to predict the measurement of the $k_y$ density-fluctuation wavenumber power spectrum via DBS, showing that the spectral exponent of the turbulent, intermediate-to-high $k_y$ density-fluctuation spectrum might be quantitatively measurable via DBS, but not the spectral peak corresponding to the driving scale of the turbulent cascade.</description>

      <title>Laser-Driven Proton-Only Acceleration in a Multicomponent Near-Critical-Density Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of collisionless shock ion acceleration is presented using a multicomponent plasma and a high-intensity picosecond duration laser pulse. Protons are the only accelerated ions when a near-critical-density plasma is driven by a laser with a modest normalized vector potential. The results of particle-in-cell simulations imply that collisionless shock may accelerate protons alone selectively, which can be an important tool for understanding the physics of inaccessible collisionless shocks in space and astrophysical plasma.</description>

      <title>Self-triggered strong-field QED collisions in laser-plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring quantum electrodynamics in the most extreme conditions, where electron-positron pairs can emerge in the presence of a strong background field, is now becoming possible in Compton collisions between ultraintense lasers and energetic electrons. In the strong-field regime, the colliding electron emits $\gamma$ rays that decay into pairs in the strong laser field. While the combination of conventional accelerators and lasers of sufficient power poses significant challenges, laser-plasma accelerators offer a promising alternative for producing the required multi-GeV electron beams. To overcome the complexities of colliding these beams with another ultraintense laser pulse, we propose a novel scheme in which a single laser pulse both accelerates the electrons and collides with them after self-focusing in a dedicated plasma section and reflecting off a plasma mirror. The laser intensity boost in the plasma allows the quantum interaction parameter to be greatly increased. Using full-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a single 100 J laser pulse can achieve a deep quantum regime with electric fields in the electron rest frame as high as $\chi_e\sim 5$ times the Schwinger critical field, resulting in the production of about 40 pC of positrons.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Electron impact partial ionization cross section and thermal rate coefficients of gaseous refrigerants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have calculated the electron impact partial and total ionization cross sections of important gaseous targets, such as Trifluoromethane (CHF$_3$), 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane $(\mathrm{C_2H_2F_4})$ or R134a, 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane $(\mathrm{C_2H_3F_3})$ or R143a, 1,1,1-Trifluoropropane $(\mathrm{C_3H_5F_3})$ or R263fb, and 3,3,3-Trifluoropropene $(\mathrm{C_3H_3F_3})$ or R1243zf using the binary encounter Bethe model and its variants. The corresponding rate coefficients are calculated for total and partial ionization cross sections using the Maxwell's velocity distribution function. Our data for partial and total ionization along with the rate coefficient showed good agreement with the existing data in the literature. The targets studied are important for plasma applications and are used in gas-based detectors at high-energy physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Stratified Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive tearing instabilities are common in fluids that are highly electrically conductive and carry strong currents. We determine the effect of stable stratification on the tearing instability under the Boussinesq approximation. Our results generalise previous work that considered only specific parameter regimes, and we show that the length scale of the fastest growing mode depends non-monotonically on the stratification strength. We confirm our analytical results by solving the linearised equations numerically, and we discuss whether the instability could operate in the solar tachocline.</description>

      <title>BxC Toolkit: Generating Tailored Turbulent 3D Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent states are ubiquitous in plasmas and the understanding of turbulence is fundamental in modern astrophysics. Numerical simulations, which are the state-of-the-art approach to the study of turbulence, require substantial computing resources. Recently, attention shifted to methods for generating synthetic turbulent magnetic fields, affordably creating fields with parameter-controlled characteristic features of turbulence. In this context, the BxC toolkit was developed and validated against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulent magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate novel extensions of BxC to generate realistic turbulent magnetic fields in a fast, controlled, geometric approach. First, we perform a parameter study to determine quantitative relations between the BxC input parameters and desired characteristic features of the turbulent power spectrum, such as the extent of the inertial range, its spectral slope, and the injection and dissipation scale. Second, we introduce in the model a set of structured background magnetic fields B0, as a natural and more realistic extension to the purely isotropic turbulent fields. Third, we extend the model to include anisotropic turbulence properties in the generated fields. With all these extensions combined, our tool can quickly generate any desired structured magnetic field with controlled, anisotropic turbulent fluctuations, faster by orders of magnitude with respect to DNSs. These can be used, e.g., to provide initial conditions for DNS simulations or easily generate synthetic data for many astrophysical settings, all at otherwise unaffordable resolutions.</description>

      <title>Existence of global weak solutions to quasilinear theory for electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasilinear theory has been widely used to describe the resonant particle-wave interaction in plasmas. It is a reduced model which originated from the Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell system in weak turbulence regime under random phase approximation and ergodicity assumptions. The system consists of particles and waves (plasmons) coupled with each other through a resonance condition relating the momentum space and the spectral space. The electrostatic case, i.e. the model originating from Vlasov-Poisson system, is the most fundamental and representative one. In this paper, we prove the existence of global weak solutions to this system modeling electrostatic plasmas in one dimension.</description>
