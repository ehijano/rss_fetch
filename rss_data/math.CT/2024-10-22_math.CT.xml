      <title>On $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a brief introduction to $\tau$-tilting theory [AIR]. In particular, we will see how our theory unifies two different branches of tilting theory, namely, silting theory and cluster tilting theory. We also introduce the history and recent developments.</description>

      <title>Bialgebras, and Lie monoid actions in Morse and Floer theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <title>A universal Kaluzhnin--Krasner embedding theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two groups $A$ and $B$, the Kaluzhnin--Krasner universal embedding theorem states that the wreath product $A\wr B$ acts as a universal receptacle for extensions from $A$ to $B$. For a split extension, this embedding is compatible with the canonical splitting of the wreath product, which is further universal in a precise sense. This result was recently extended to Lie algebras and to cocommutative Hopf algebras.
  The aim of the present article is to explore the feasibility of adapting the theorem to other types of algebraic structures. By explaining the underlying unity of the three known cases, our analysis gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to happen.
  From those we may for instance conclude that a version for crossed modules can indeed be attained, while the theorem cannot be adapted to, say, associative algebras, Jordan algebras or Leibniz algebras, when working over an infinite field: we prove that then, amongst non-associative algebras, only Lie algebras admit a universal Kaluzhnin--Krasner embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Pseudolimits for Tangent Categories and Equivariant Tangents for Varieties and Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if $\mathscr{C}$ is a category and if $F\colon\mathscr{C} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ is a pseudofunctor such that for each object $X$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the category $F(X)$ is a tangent category and for each morphism $f$ of $\mathscr{C}$ the functor $F(f)$ is part of a strong tangent morphism $(F(f),\!{}_{f}{\alpha})$ and that furthermore the natural transformations $\!{}_{f}{\alpha}$ vary pseudonaturally in $\mathscr{C}^{\operatorname{op}}$, then there is a tangent structure on the pseudolimit $\mathbf{PC}(F)$ which is induced by the tangent structures on the categories $F(X)$ together with how they vary through the functors $F(f)$. We use this observation to show that the forgetful $2$-functor $\operatorname{Forget}:\mathfrak{Tan} \to \mathfrak{Cat}$ creates and preserves pseudolimits indexed by $1$-categories. As an application, this allows us to describe how equivariant descent interacts with the tangent structures on the category of smooth (real) manifolds and on various categories of (algebraic) varieties over a field.</description>

      <title>How to Represent Non-Representable Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrows of a category are elements of particular sets, the hom-sets. These sets are functorial, and their functoriality specifies how to compose the arrows with other arrows of the same category. In particular, it allows to form diagrams, making many abstract concepts graphically visible.
  Presheaves and set-valued functors, in general, are not representable, and so their elements are not arrows in the usual sense. They can however still be seen as "arrow-like structures", which can be post-composed but not pre-composed (for the case of set functors), or pre-composed but not post-composed (for the case of presheaves). Therefore, we can still represent their structure graphically.
  In this exposition we show how to draw and interpret these generalized diagrams, and how to use them to prove theorems. We will then study in detail, and represent graphically, a few concepts of category theory which are often considered hard to visualize: representability, weighted limits and colimits, and Cauchy completion (for unenriched categories).
  We also sketch how to interpret the more general case of profunctors, and the Day convolution of presheaves.</description>

      <title>Two-term silting and $\tau$-cluster morphism categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03472v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalise $\tau$-cluster morphism categories to the setting of non-positive dg algebras with finite dimensional cohomology in all degrees. The compatibility of silting reduction with support $\tau$-tilting reduction will be an essential ingredient when linking our definition to those of Buan--Marsh and Buan--Hanson.</description>

      <title>Categorical composable cryptography: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13232v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize the simulation paradigm of cryptography in terms of category theory and show that protocols secure against abstract attacks form a symmetric monoidal category, thus giving an abstract model of composable security definitions in cryptography. Our model is able to incorporate computational security, set-up assumptions and various attack models such as colluding or independently acting subsets of adversaries in a modular, flexible fashion. We conclude by using string diagrams to rederive the security of the one-time pad, correctness of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and no-go results concerning the limits of bipartite and tripartite cryptography, ruling out e.g., composable commitments and broadcasting. On the way, we exhibit two categorical constructions of resource theories that might be of independent interest: one capturing resources shared among multiple parties and one capturing resource conversions that succeed asymptotically.
  This is a corrected version of the paper arXiv:2208.13232 published originally on December 18, 2023.</description>

      <title>On The Axioms Of $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adhesive and quasiadhesive categories provide a general framework for the study of algebraic graph rewriting systems. In a quasiadhesive category any two regular subobjects have a join which is again a regular subobject. Vice versa, if regular monos are adhesive, then the existence of a regular join for any pair of regular subobjects entails quasiadhesivity. It is also known (quasi)adhesive categories can be embedded in a Grothendieck topos via a functor preserving pullbacks and pushouts along (regular) monomorphisms. In this paper we extend these results to $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesive categories, a concept recently introduced to generalize the notion of (quasi)adhesivity. We introduce the notion of $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphism, which allows us to express $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesivity as a condition on the subobjects's posets. Moreover, $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphisms allows us to show how an $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-adhesive category can be embedded into a Grothendieck topos, preserving pullbacks and $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-pushouts.</description>

      <title>Universal Extensions and Ext-Orthogonal Complements of Torsion Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that torsion pairs in Krull--Schmidt abelian categories induce an equivalence between the subcategory of torsion-free objects admitting universal extensions to the torsion subcategory, and a quotient of the ext-orthogonal complement of the torsion subcategory.
  This generalize an equivalence described by Bauer--Botnan--Oppermann--Steen for tilting-torsion pairs and by Buan--Zhou for functorially finite torsion pairs. The result also provides a more direct proof of the functorially finite case, not relying on the machinery of two-term silting complexes.
  We illustrate the equivalence in the special case of tube categories.
  After first appearing on the arXiv, the author learnt that the equivalence has previously been described by Demonet--Iyama.</description>
