      <title>Random 2D linear cocycles I: dichotomic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a Bochi-Ma\~n\'e type dichotomy in the space of two dimensional, nonnegative determinant matrix valued, locally constant linear cocycles over a Bernoulli or Markov shift. Moreover, we prove that Lebesgue almost every such cocycle has finite first Lyapunov exponent, which then implies a break in the regularity of the Lyapunov exponent, from analyticity to discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution in rank 2 homogeneous spaces and values of quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish effective equidistribution theorems, with a polynomial error rate, for orbits of unipotent subgroups in quotients of quasi-split, almost simple Linear algebraic groups of absolute rank 2.
  As an application, inspired by the results of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes, we establish quantitative results regarding the distribution of values of an indefinite ternary quadratic form at integer points, giving in particular an effective and quantitative proof of the Oppenheim Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis of an HIV infection model with latent reservoir, immune impairment and delayed CTL immune response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a dynamic model of HIV infection that incorporates latent hosts, CTL immunity, saturated incidence rates, and two transmission mechanisms: virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell transmission. The model has three kinds of delays: CTL immune response delay, replication of viruses delay, and intracellular delay. Initially, the model's solutions are confirmed to be both positive and bounded for nonnegative initial values. Following this, two biologically critical parameters were identified: the virus reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the CTL immune reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_1$. Subsequently, by invoking LaSalle's principle of invariance alongside Lyapunov functionals, we establish stability criteria for each equilibrium. The results indicate that the stability of the endemic equilibrium may be altered by a positive CTL immune delay, whereas intracellular and viral replication delays do not affect the equilibria. By considering the delay in the CTL immune response as a bifurcation-inducing threshold, we derive the exact conditions necessary for these stability transitions. Further analysis shows that increasing the CTL immune delay destabilizes the endemic equilibrium, inducing a Hopf bifurcation. To corroborate these theoretical results, numerical simulations are systematically conducted.</description>

      <title>Measures of maximal entropy for $C^\infty$ three-dimensional flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove for $C^\infty$ non-singular flows on three-dimensional compact manifolds with positive entropy, there are at most finitely many ergodic measures of maximal entropy. This result extends the notable work of Buzzi-Crovisier-Sarig (\emph{Ann. of Math.}, 2022) on surface diffeomorphisms. Our approach differs by addressing the continuity of Lyapunov exponents and the uniform largeness of Pesin sets for measures of maximal entropy. Furthermore, it also provides an alternative proof for the case of surface diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Young structures for partially hyperbolic systems with mostly contracting central direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of Young structures for a broad class of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with a splitting $TM = E^{cs} \oplus E^{uu}$, under exactly the same conditions that ensure the existence of SRB measures in a previous work by Bonatti and Viana. This extends the applicability of statistical techniques to systems where statistical properties remained largely unexplored. Our approach refines previous methods, introducing key adaptations to the partially hyperbolic setting. These results provide a foundation for obtaining decay of correlations, Central Limit Theorem, large deviations and a vector-valued almost sure invariance principle in this class of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of semisimple adelic periods and representations of quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for semisimple closed orbits on compact adelic quotients. The obtained error depends polynomially on the minimal complexity of intermediate orbits and the complexity of the ambient space. The proof uses dynamical arguments, property $(\tau)$, Prasad's volume formula, an effective closing lemma, and a novel effective generation result for subgroups. The latter in turn relies on an effective version of Greenberg's theorem.
  We apply the above to the problem of establishing a local-global principle for representations of integral quadratic forms, improving the codimension assumptions and providing effective bounds in a theorem of Ellenberg and Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics of a parabolic-ODE SIS epidemic model with saturated incidence mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a parabolic-ODE SIS epidemic model with no-flux boundary conditions in a heterogeneous environment. The model incorporates a saturated infection mechanism \({SI}/(m(x) + S + I)\) with \(m \geq,\,\not\equiv 0\). This study is motivated by disease control strategies, such as quarantine and lockdown, that limit population movement. We examine two scenarios: one where the movement of the susceptible population is restricted, and another where the movement of the infected population is neglected. We establish the long-term dynamics of the solutions in each scenario. Compared to previous studies that assume the absence of a saturated incidence function (i.e., $m\equiv 0$), our findings highlight the novel and significant interplay between total population size, transmission risk level, and the saturated incidence function in influencing disease persistence, extinction, and spatial distribution. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results, and the implications of the results are discussed in the context of disease control and eradication strategies.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds and guaranteed convergence of the Koopman-Hill projection stability method for linear time-periodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman-Hill projection method is used to approximate the fundamental solution matrix of linear time-periodic ordinary differential equations, possibly stemming from linearization around a periodic solution of a nonlinear dynamical system. By expressing both the true fundamental solution and its approximation as series, we derive an upper bound for the approximation error that decays exponentially with the size of the Hill matrix. Exponential decay of the Fourier coefficients of the system dynamics is key to guarantee convergence. The paper also analyzes a subharmonic formulation that improves the convergence rate. Two numerical examples, including a Duffing oscillator, illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Large-Period Traveling Waves Bifurcating from the Heteroclinic Loop in the FitzHugh-Nagumo Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wave front and a wave back that spontaneously connect two hyperbolic equilibria, known as a heteroclinic wave loop, give rise to periodic waves with arbitrarily large spatial periods through the heteroclinic bifurcation. The nonlinear stability of these periodic waves is established in the setting of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, which is a well-known reaction-diffusion model with degenerate diffusion. First, for general systems, we give the expressions of spectra with small modulus for linearized operators about these periodic waves via the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and the Lin-Sandstede method. Second, applying these spectral results to the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, we establish their diffusive spectral stability. Finally, we consider the nonlinear stability of these periodic waves against localized perturbations. We introduce a spatiotemporal phase modulation $\varphi$, and couple it with the associated modulated perturbation $\mathbf{V}$ along with the unmodulated perturbation $\mathbf{\widetilde{V}}$ to close a nonlinear iteration argument.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and chaos in complex ecological communities with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the wide range of dynamics observed in ecological communities is challenging due to the large number of species involved, the complex network of interactions among them, and the influence of multiple environmental variables. Here, we consider a general framework to model the dynamics of species-rich communities under the effects of external environmental factors, showing that it naturally leads to delayed interactions between species, and analyze the impact of such memory effects on population dynamics. Employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with time delays and random interactions, we characterize the resulting dynamical phases in terms of the statistical properties of community interactions. Our findings reveal that memory effects can generate persistent and synchronized oscillations in species abundances in sufficiently competitive communities. This provides an additional explanation for synchronization in large communities, complementing known mechanisms such as predator-prey cycles and environmental periodic variability. Furthermore, we show that when reciprocal interactions are negatively correlated, time delays alone can induce chaotic behavior. This suggests that ecological complexity is not a prerequisite for unpredictable population dynamics, as intrinsic memory effects are sufficient to generate long-term fluctuations in species abundances. The techniques developed in this work are applicable to any high-dimensional random dynamical system with time delays.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for geodesic flow on CAT(-1) spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a proper geodesically complete CAT(-1) space equipped with a discrete non-elementary action, and a bounded continuous potential with the Bowen property, we construct weighted quasi-conformal Patterson densities and use them to build a Gibbs measure on the space of geodesic lines. Our construction yields a Gibbs measure with local product structure for any potential in this class, which includes bounded H\"older continuous potentials. Furthermore, if the Gibbs measure is finite, then we prove that it is the unique equilibrium state. In contrast to previous results in this direction, we do not require any condition that the potential must take the same value on two geodesic lines which share a common segment.</description>

      <title>Linear response for random and sequential intermittent maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes a quenched (trajectory-wise) linear response formula for random intermittent dynamical systems, consisting of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with varying parameters. This result complements recent annealed (averaged) results in the i.i.d setting. As an intermediate step, we show existence, uniqueness and statistical stability of the random absolutely continuous invariant probability measure (a.c.i.m.) for such non-uniformly expanding systems. Furthermore, we investigate sequential intermittent dynamical systems of this type and establish a linear response formula. Our arguments rely on the cone technique introduced by Baladi and Todd and further developed by Lepp{\"a}nen.
  We also demonstrate that sequential systems exhibit a subtle distinction from both random and autonomous settings: they may possess infinitely many sequential absolutely continuous equivariant densities. However, only one of these corresponds to an SRB state in the sense of Ruelle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop data-driven methods incorporating geometric and topological information to learn parsimonious representations of nonlinear dynamics from observations. The approaches learn nonlinear state-space models of the dynamics for general manifold latent spaces using training strategies related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Our methods are referred to as Geometric Dynamic (GD) Variational Autoencoders (GD-VAEs). We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other architectures. Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning reduced dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers Equations, Constrained Mechanical Systems, and spatial fields of Reaction-Diffusion Systems. GD-VAEs provide methods that can be used to obtain representations in manifold latent spaces for diverse learning tasks involving dynamics.</description>
