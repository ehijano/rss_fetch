      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Nanoscale Frictional Properties of Two-Dimensional SnSe and SnSe$_2$ with Lateral Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employed lateral force microscopy, a specialized technique within atomic force microscopy, to explore the nanoscale frictional properties of 2D SnSe and SnSe$_2$ layers, and we compared these findings with graphene, a commonly used solid lubricant. Our results revealed that SnSe and SnSe2 layers exhibited superior lubricative performance compared to graphene with similar thickness, with SnSe$_2$ demonstrating friction levels up to three times lower. This lower friction observed in SnSe$_2$, as compared to SnSe, was further substantiated by extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, confirming the intrinsic material properties contributing to their enhanced lubricative behavior.</description>

      <title>LLM4Mat-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials science. However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standardized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hinders progress. We present LLM4Mat-Bench, the largest benchmark to date for evaluating the performance of LLMs in predicting the properties of crystalline materials. LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total, collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct properties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal composition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B tokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and provide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The results highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science and the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific instruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantum chemical study of the influence of torsional deformation on the properties of chiral WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus-nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work sheds light on the electronic band properties of chiral WSSe Janus nanotubes from the quantum mechanical perspective. Line groups theory developed by Damnjanovich was used to model mechanical torsion of chiral nanotubes with different symmetries. Known natural torsion in chiral nanotubes was observed. It was shown that mechanical stress can be used as a tool to tune electronic properties of the nanotubes including the change of the nature of the electron transition. On the DFT-level of the theory the stability of WS2, WSe2 and Janus WSSe nanotubes was estimated. Applicability of stable Janus-nanotubes to photocatalytic water-splitting was suggested based on the calculated electronic properties</description>

      <title>Room-temperature vacancy emission from the jog on edge dislocation in FCC nickel under glide force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jogs, atomic-scale steps on dislocations, play an important role in crystal plasticity, yet they are often ignored in discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations due to their small sizes. While jogs on screw dislocations are known to move non-conservatively (i.e. climb) accompanied by vacancy emission, jogs on edge dislocations are commonly expected to move conservatively (i.e. glide) with the dislocation under ambient conditions. Here we report unexpected findings from molecular dynamics simulations of an edge dislocation containing a pair of unit jogs in face-centered cubic nickel at 300K. While the jogs glide conservatively with the edge dislocation at low stresses, we observe that one of the jogs climbs and emits vacancies intermittently at higher stresses. This observation is unexpected at such a low temperature, as climb is typically associated with temperatures closer to the creep temperature (roughly half of the melting temperature). Our results highlight the significance of the complex interplay between point defects (i.e., vacancies) and dislocations in room-temperature plasticity, suggesting that these interactions may be more significant than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Modelling Silica using MACE-MP-0 Machine Learnt Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica polymorphs and zeolites are fundamental to a wide range of industrial applications owing to their diverse structural characteristics, thermodynamic and mechanical stability under varying conditions and due to their geological importance. Computational modelling has played a crucial role in understanding the relationship between the structure and functionality of silicas and silicates including zeolites. In this study, we apply the MACE-MP-0 machine learnt interatomic potentials (ML-IP) to model the framework energies of siliceous zeolites and examine the phase transitions of silica and ZSM-5 polymorphs under high-pressure conditions. The results reproduce the known metastability of siliceous zeolites relative to {\alpha}-quartz, with energy differences between microporous and dense phases calculated by MACE-MP-0 medium ML-IP and density functional theory (DFT) methods closely aligning with experimental calorimetric data. The high-pressure simulations reveal distinct compression behaviour in the quartz, coesite, and stishovite polymorphs of silica, with coesite and stishovite showing increased stability at elevated pressures in line with experimental data. The calculated phase transition pressures from quartz to coesite (~3.5 GPa) and coesite to stishovite (~9 GPa) are close to experimental findings, demonstrating the reliability of MACE ML-IP in modelling the structural and energetic properties of silica polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Controlling electronic properties of hexagonal manganites through aliovalent doping and thermoatmospheric history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of hexagonal manganites is intensively studied for its multiferroicity, magnetoelectric coupling, improper ferroelectricity, functional domain walls, and topology-related scaling behaviors. It is established that these physical properties are co-determined by the cation sublattices and that aliovalent doping can readily be leveraged to modify them. The doping, however, also impacts the anion defect chemistry and semiconducting properties, which makes the system highly sensitive to the synthesis and processing conditions. Here, we study the electronic properties of YMnO3 as function of aliovalent cation doping and thermoatmospheric history, combining density functional theory calculations with thermopower and thermogravimetric measurements. We show that the charge carrier concentration and transport properties can be controlled via both aliovalent cation dopants and anion defects, enabling reversible switching between n-type and p-type conductivity. This tunability is of importance for envisaged applications of hexagonal manganites in, e.g. next-generation capacitors and domain-wall nanoelectronics, or as catalysts or electrodes in fuel cells or electrolyzers. Furthermore, our approach is transferrable to other transition metal oxides, providing general guidelines for controlling their semiconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Transverse Current Generation by Circularly Polarized Light in Terahertz-Biased Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse current generation by circularly polarized light in biased matter has attracted considerable attention for studies of Floquet engineering and inverse spin Hall effect. Field-induced circular photogalvanic effect (FI-CPGE) also contributes to the current, but has been overlooked in many literatures. Using terahertz pulses as a bias field, we study the case of a prototypical semiconductor GaAs by two-dimensional Fourier analysis. We demonstrate the remarkable role of FI-CPGE resonantly enhanced near the band degeneracy, suggesting its potential to detect monopoles in momentum space. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the light-induced anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional MnBX monolayer as promising anode with record-high capacity and fast diffusion for Na-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the group structure search method of first principles, MnB, MnB2, and MnB6 monolayer two-dimensional systems were designed and their structure, stability, electronic properties, as well as performance as anodes for sodium-ion batteries were examined. The findings indicate that the MnB, MnB2, and MnB6 monolayer two-dimensional systems possess high thermal stability, mechanical stability, dynamic stability, and distinctive metallic properties. When utilized in sodium-ion batteries, these MnB, MnB2, and MnB6 monolayers demonstrate high storage capacity, low diffusion barriers, and moderate open-circuit voltage. Due to its unique structure, the MnB monolayer presents a negative Poisson's ratio and a very low diffusion barrier. The theoretical capacitance of the MnB2 monolayer, when acting as an anode for sodium-ion batteries, exceeds that of the MnB and MnB6 monolayers. The research results reveal that boron-rich two-dimensional electrode materials pave a new way for energy applications. Particularly, MnB2 and MnB6 monolayer two-dimensional systems, as anode materials, incorporate the advantages of both planar and corrugated monolayer structures.</description>

      <title>Fragile altermagnetism and orbital disorder in Mott insulator LaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on ab initio calculations, we demonstrate that a Mott insulator LaTiO$_3$ (LTO), not inspected previously as an altermagnetic material, shows the characteristic features of altermagnets, i.e., (i) fully compensated antiferromagnetism and (ii) $\mathbf{k}$-dependent spin-split electron bands in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The altermagnetic ground state of LTO is protected by the crystal symmetry and specifically ordered $d$-orbitals of Ti ions with the orbital momentum $l=2.$ The altermagnetism occurs when sites of Ti pair in the unit cell are occupied by single electrons with $m=-1,s_{z}=+1/2$ and $m=+1,s_{z}=-1/2$ per site, with $m$ and $s_{z}-$ being the $z-$ component of the orbital momentum and spin, respectively. By further simulating orbital disorder within the Green's function method, we disclose its damaging character on the spin splitting and the resulting altermagnetism. When the single-electron spin-polarized state at each Ti site is contributed almost equally by two or three $t_{2g}$ orbitals, LTO becomes antiferromagnetic. The effect of the spin-orbit coupling, which can cause orbital disorder and suppress altermagnetism, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Ising and regular solution models revisited for 2D open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ising model is well-known for illustrating the fundamental characteristics of phase transitions in closed systems. In this article, we propose a generalization of the two-dimensional Ising model to open systems, considering the divergence of external fluxes within a mean-field approximation, and explore its application for classifying steady states based on external flux (deposition rate), temperature, and composition. We focus on cases with positive mixing energy, which lead to the typical spinodal and binodal domes at the phase diagram under the regular solution approximation for closed systems. For open systems, we demonstrate that a supercritical external flux divergence stabilizes the system, preventing decomposition. We identify rate-dependent spinodal and binodal domes, as well as a subdivision of the instability region at subcritical rates into three distinct steady-state morphologies: spots (gepard-like), layers (zebra-like), and mixed patterns (a combination of gepard and zebra). This morphology map depends on the initial conditions, demonstrating memory effects and hysteresis.</description>

      <title>The effect of formation temperature and flexo-chemical strains on the electrophysical properties of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesized the powder of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution at temperatures from 130oC to 180oC in hydrothermal conditions. The detailed analysis of the XPS, EDX and Raman spectroscopy results reveal the significant amount of the molybdenum oxides, sulfides and sulfates in the molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes, which allows to consider the "effective" formulae MoSxOy for their chemical composition. The MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal unusual electric transport features interesting for material science and promising for applications. The chemical composition and microstructure of the nanoflakes, which are determined by the temperature of synthesis, is shown to be responsible for the electro-conduction mechanism. Namely, the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grow monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, synthesized at the temperatures T_s&lt;&lt;150oC and T_s&gt;&gt;150oC, being non-ohmic and hysteretic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. The I-V curves acquire N-like shape with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity part at T_s=150oC. Both with and without N-shape, the I-V curves manifest hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters are determined by the temperature of synthesis. Important, that the studied nanoflakes manifest very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off".Considering that the presence of oxygen non-stoichiometry and bending can create strong flexo-chemical strains in the nanoflakes, we proposed the flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, which describes the observed I-V curves.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Optimization onto Thermoelectric Performance via Hydrostatic-Pressure in Chalcopyrite AgXTe2 (X=In, Ga)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure tuning has emerged as a powerful strategy for manipulating the thermoelectric properties of materials by inducing structural and electronic modifications. Herein, we systematically investigate the transport properties and thermoelectric performance concerning lattice distortions induced by hydrostatic pressure in Ag-based chalcopyrite AgXTe2 (X=In, Ga). The findings reveal that the lattice distortion in AgXTe2 exhibits distinct behaviors under lattice compression, diverging from trends observed at ambient pressure. Importantly, the hydrostatic pressure breaks the phenomenally negative correlation between thermal conductivity and lattice distortion. Pressure-induced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonons broadens the low-energy phonon spectrum, enhancing interactions between acoustic and optical phonons. Such broadening substantially increases the number of available three-phonon scattering channels, resulting in a marked reduction in thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, we establish a macroscopic connection between metavalent bonding and anharmonicity, providing an indirect explanation for lattice anharmonicity through pressure-driven transferred charge. Additionally, the applied pressure achieves a notable net increase in the power factor despite the strong coupling of electrical transport parameters, which underscores the potential for bidirectional optimization of transport properties in AgXTe2. As a result, the maximum ZT value of AgInTe2 is nearly doubled, demonstrating that pressure modulation is a powerful strategy for enhancing thermoelectric performance. Our work not only establishes the link between pressure, lattice dynamics, and thermoelectric properties within chalcopyrite AgXTe2, but also inspires the exploration of pressure-related optimization strategies for conventional thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of Grain Boundary Effects on Fluorine-Induced Initial Corrosion of NiCr Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium depletion at grain boundaries (GBs) due to selective attack is a critical issue in the molten salt corrosion of NiCr alloys. Despite the importance of GBs in this process from numerous experimental studies, most theoretical work has predominantly focused on fluorine interactions with idealized crystalline surfaces, neglecting the complexity of GB local environments. This study aims to bridge that gap by employing density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the atomic interactions and Cr dissolution mechanisms at GB in NiCr alloys under molten fluoride salt environments. Specifically, a $\Sigma$5(210)/(001) symmetrical tilt GB is constructed to explore the adsorption energies of fluorine on Ni(100) and Cr-doped Ni(100) surfaces. We find that fluorine exhibits a strong preference for binding at GB sites, with Cr doping amplifying this effect, leading to higher adsorption energies compared to bulk Ni surfaces. Fluorine bonding with Cr significantly alters the interaction between Cr-F complexes and Ni substrate, and the consequent dissolution barriers for Cr atoms; the formation of CrF$_3$ largely reduces the energy barrier for Cr dissolution. This work highlights the essential role of GBs in enhancing fluorine adsorption and accelerating Cr depletion, providing new insights into the mechanisms of early-stage corrosion in NiCr alloys.</description>

      <title>From supefluid 3He to altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle combined with interactions between fermions is a unifying basic mechanism that can give rise to quantum phases with spin order in diverse physical systems. Transition-metal ferromagnets, with isotropic ordering respecting crystallographic rotation symmetries and with a net magnetization, are a relatively common manifestation of this mechanism, leading to numerous practical applications, e.g., in spintronic information technologies. In contrast, superfluid $^3$He has been a unique and fragile manifestation, in which the spin-ordered phase is anisotropic, breaking the real-space rotation symmetries, and has zero net magnetization. The recently discovered altermagnets share the spin-ordered anisotropic zero-magnetization nature of superfluid $^3$He. Yet, altermagnets appear to be even more abundant than ferromagnets, can be robust, and are projected to offer superior scalability for spintronics compared to ferromagnets. Our Perspective revisits the decades of research of the spin-ordered anisotropic zero-magnetization phases including, besides superfluid $^3$He, also theoretically conceived counterparts in nematic electronic liquid-crystal phases. While all sharing the same extraordinary character of symmetry breaking, we highlight the distinctions in microscopic physics which set altermagnets apart and enable their robust and abundant material realizations.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic suppression of anomalous Hall effect in Fe-rich kagome magnet Fe3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Fe-based kagome magnets, Fe3Sn has been predicted to have the largest intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and the highest Curie temperature TC = 743 K. However, the current experimental results show that the total AHC is much lower than the predicted value due to the strong extrinsic contribution. To suppress the extrinsic contribution and thus enhance the intrinsic contribution, we increased the Fe content in the stoichiometric Fe3Sn. We found that the extrinsic contribution is greatly suppressed, and the intrinsic contribution is dominant and is close to the theoretically predicted value of 555 S/cm over the whole temperature range. Based on the formula of the skew scattering, we analyzed the reason why the skew scattering is suppressed and found that the spin-orbit coupling strength provided by the impurity center is the key. The spin-orbit coupling strength provided by Fe as an impurity center in this study is much smaller than that of Sn as an impurity center in previous studies. Therefore, the AHC in Fe-rich Fe3Sn obeys the unified theory, while the AHC in Sn-rich Fe3Sn deviates from the unified theory. Our study provides a promising solution for the regulation of the extrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall effect in kagome magnets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Competition Between Orbital and Exchange Interactions Selectively Localizes Electrons and Holes Through Polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange interaction. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to dominant Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within ~373+/-137 fs due to enhanced superexchange interactions. Ab initio theory demonstrates that both electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Profiling of Ladder Polymer Structure using Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ladder polymers, known for their rigid, ladder-like structures, exhibit exceptional thermal stability and mechanical strength, positioning them as candidates for advanced applications. However, accurately determining their structure from solution scattering remains a challenge. Their chain conformation is largely governed by the intrinsic orientational properties of the monomers and their relative orientations, leading to a bimodal distribution of bending angles, unlike conventional polymer chains whose bending angles follow a unimodal Gaussian distribution. Meanwhile, traditional scattering models for polymer chains do not account for these unique structural features. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations to address this challenge. We first develop a Monte Carlo simulation for sampling the configuration space of ladder polymers, where each monomer is modeled as a biaxial segment. Then, we establish a machine learning-assisted scattering analysis framework based on Gaussian Process Regression. Finally, we conduct small-angle neutron scattering experiments on a ladder polymer solution to apply our approach. Our method uncovers structural details of ladder polymers that conventional methods fail to capture.</description>

      <title>Topological Orbital Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) is attracting recent interest due to its fundamental science implications and potential applications in orbitronics and spintronics. Unlike the spin Hall effect, the connection between the OHE and band topology is not well understood. Here we present a novel approach for understanding the OHE based on analyzing the projected orbital angular momentum (POAM) spectrum. By considering monolayers of group IV elements, we demonstrate that the Wannier charge centers of the POAM spectrum display topologically nontrivial windings. The orbital Hall conductivity is found to form a plateau within the band gap as a direct consequence of the Chern number carried by the POAM spectrum. The topological orbital Hall phase is shown to yield a new form of bulk-boundary correspondence, which features gapless states in the POAM spectrum and induces nonzero orbital textures at the boundaries that should be amenable to experimental verification through ARPES measurements. Our study presents a systematic method for investigating the topological OHE and provides a pathway for its broader exploration in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Orbital Edelstein effect of electronic itinerant orbital motion at edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of orbital angular momentum (OAM), the focus has been predominantly on the intra-atomic contribution. However, recent research has begun to shift towards exploring the inter-atomic contribution to OAM dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) arising from the inter-atomic OAM at the edges. We explore the OAM texture within edge states and unveil the OAM accumulation at the edges using several lattice models based on the $s$ orbital. By comparing slabs with differently shaped edges, we not only clarify the role of electron wiggling motion in shaping OAM texture but also highlight the absence of bulk-boundary correspondence in the accumulation process. The topological insulator and higher-order topological insulator models further confirm these findings and provide evidence for the relationship between the higher-order topology and the OEE. Our study advances the comprehension of orbital physics and extends its scope to higher-order topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Topological Superstructure of Magnetic Hopfions Threaded by Meron Strings in Easy-plane Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spin textures exhibit a hierarchical nature. For instance, magnetic skyrmions, which possess a particle-like nature, can aggregate to form superstructures such as skyrmion strings and skyrmion lattices. Magnetic hopfions are also regarded as superstructures constructed from closed loops of twisted skyrmion strings, which behave as another independent particles. However, it remains elusive whether such magnetic hopfions can also aggregate to form higher-level superstructures. Here, we report a stable superstructure with three-dimensional periodic arrangement of magnetic hopfions in a frustrated spin model with easy-plane anisotropy. By comprehensively examining effective interactions between two hopfions, we construct the hopfion superstructure by a staggered arrangement of one-dimensional hopfion chains with Hopf number $H=+1$ and $H=-1$ running perpendicular to the easy plane. Each hopfion chain is threaded by a magnetic meron string, resulting in a nontrivial topological texture with skyrmion number $N_{\rm sk}=2$ per magnetic unit cell on any two-dimensional cut parallel to the easy plane. We show that the hopfion superstructure remains robust as a metastable state across a range of the hopfion density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that superstructures with higher Hopf number can also be stabilized. Our findings extend the existing hierarchy of topological magnets and pave the way for exploring new quantum phenomena and spin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The sustainable production of many bulk chemicals relies on heterogeneous catalysis. The rational design or improvement of the required catalysts critically depends on insights into the underlying mechanisms at the atomic scale. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in applying advanced experimental techniques to complex catalytic reactions in operando, but in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding, additional information from computer simulations is indispensable in many cases. In particular, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has become an important tool to explicitly address the atomistic level structure, dynamics, and reactivity of interfacial systems, but the high computational costs limit applications to systems consisting of at most a few hundred atoms for simulation times of up to tens of picoseconds. Rapid advances in the development of modern machine learning potentials (MLP) now offer a new approach to bridge this gap, enabling simulations of complex catalytic reactions with ab initio accuracy at a small fraction of the computational costs. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of applying MLPs to systems relevant for heterogeneous catalysis along with a discussion of the prospects for the use of MLPs in catalysis science in the years to come.</description>

Abstract: We study ferroelectricity in the classic perovskite ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ to high pressures with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental diamond-anvil techniques. We use second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy to detect lack of inversion symmetry. Consistent with early understanding and experiments, we find that ferroelectricity disappears at moderate pressures. However, DFT computations show that the disappearance arises from the overtaking of zone boundary instabilities, and not from the squeezing out of the off-centering ferroelectric displacements with pressure, as previously thought. Moreover, at high pressures the distorted perovskite phases are metastable with respect to a new dense centrosymmetric post-perovskite phase with P$2_1/m$ symmetry and 8-coordinated Ti, which becomes stable at about 70 GPa.</description>

Abstract: Topological semimetals with massless Dirac and Weyl fermions represent the forefront of quantum materials research. In two dimensions (2D), a peculiar class of fermions that are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular direction was predicted sixteen years ago. These highly exotic quasiparticles - the semi-Dirac fermions - ignited intense theoretical and experimental interest but remain undetected. Using magneto-optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate the defining feature of semi-Dirac fermions - $B^{2/3}$ scaling of Landau levels - in a prototypical nodal-line metal ZrSiS. In topological metals, including ZrSiS, nodal-lines extend the band degeneracies from isolated points to lines, loops or even chains in the momentum space. With $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations and theoretical modeling, we pinpoint the observed semi-Dirac spectrum to the crossing points of nodal-lines in ZrSiS. Crossing nodal-lines exhibit a continuum absorption spectrum but with singularities that scale as $B^{2/3}$ at the crossing. Our work sheds light on the hidden quasiparticles emerging from the intricate topology of crossing nodal-lines and highlights the potential to explore quantum geometry with linear optical responses.</description>

Abstract: Using high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy, we correlate the local bandgap (Eg), indium concentration, and strain distribution across multiple InxGa1-xAs quantum wells (QWs), on a GaAs substrate, within a metamorphic laser structure. Our findings reveal significant inhomogeneities, particularly near the interfaces, for both the indium and strain distribution, and subtle variations in the Eg across individual QWs. The interplay between strain, composition, and Eg was further explored by density functional theory simulations, indicating that variations in the Eg are predominantly influenced by the indium concentration, with strain playing a minor role. The observed local inhomogeneities suggest that differences between individual QWs may affect the collective emission and performance of the final device. This study highlights the importance of spatially resolved analysis in understanding and optimising the electronic and optical properties for designing of next-generation metamorphic lasers with multiple QWs as the active region.</description>

      <title>Defect energy formalism for CALPHAD thermodynamics of dilute point defects: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of point defects is crucial for determining the functional properties of materials. Defect stability is typically assessed using grand-canonical defect formation energy, which requires deducing the equilibrium chemical potential or Fermi level. This process is complicated by the interplay of chemical potential and Fermi level and their dependence on composition and temperature. The grand-canonical formation energy is added to the bulk Gibbs energy, creating a defect-centric framework where each new defect state needs a distinct Gibbs energy formulation. The CALPHAD method offers a more flexible alternative by integrating defect energies into the total Gibbs energy model, allowing easier extrapolation to complex compositions. CALPHAD unifies the analysis of chemically and electronically driven defects using chemical composition as the primary variable. However, the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF) used in CALPHAD has limitations, such as a lack of clear connections between defect formation energies and Gibbs energy parameters and an exponential increase in complexity with added chemical or charge variations. We present the theoretical derivation of the Defect Energy Formalism (DEF), which overcomes CEF limitations by establishing explicit relationships between absolute defect energies - independent of chemical potential and Fermi level - and the Gibbs energy parameters of defective compounds. This results in a first-principles model for dilute defects, eliminating the need for model fitting to experimental or simulation data. DEF reduces the complexity of CEF by applying the superposition of absolute defect energies, making it feasible for modeling multi-component and chemically complex compounds. This paper presents a formal derivation of DEF and offers guidelines for its application, promising more accurate and efficient thermodynamic modeling of defective materials.</description>

Abstract: The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties. Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders. While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph ($\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\textbf{T}$ransformers $\textbf{o}$n $\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks, and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and traditional crystals.</description>

Abstract: Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to its symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting field-induced topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional methods, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in Bilbao Crystallographic Server with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 candidate materials for topological magnons, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Growth of Large Area WSe$_{2-x}$ and Observation of Photogenerated Inversion Layer</title>

Abstract: Here, we report the full-fledged journey towards the material synthesis and characterization of few-layered/thin WSe$_2$ using sputtered W-films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates followed by electrical studies under dark and illumination conditions. Growth temperature 500oC and gas pressure 55 sccm are found to be the optimized parameters for formation of thermodynamically stable WSe$_{2-x}$ with dominant Raman peak at 265 cm-1. XRD and HR-TEM measurement clarify the formation of high crystallinity along the c-axis and quasi-crystallinity along a and b axes respectively. Lower intensities from Raman-measurement and PL-peak at 768 nm (with 532 nm excitation wavelength) infers the thin nature of the grown film, along with strong second harmonic emission with excitation wavelength varying from 350nm to 450 nm. This work also retracks the controlled etching by reactive ions to achieve large area bi/tri-layer films to fabricate advanced devices. We also have fabricated an advanced MOS structure on SiO$_2$/p-Si substrate which shows tremendous performance by means of photo-capacitance under illumination condition where photo-carriers can survive the higher probe frequencies (&gt; 1MHz). Under illumination condition, HfO$_2$/WSe$_2$ embedded MOS shows its dominance showing a huge electron-inversion region over HfO$_2$/ SiO$_2$/p-Si and SiO$_2$/p-Si MOS devices even at high frequencies (1-10 MHz). Thereby, this work also reveals a possible route for capacitance based highly sensitive photodetection using conventional Si-technology with integration of such WSe$_2$/W as an active material.</description>

      <title>Giant Seebeck Effect in PEDOT Materials with Molecular Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) has been attracting attention as a thermoelectric material for room-temperature use due to its flexibility and non-toxicity. However, PEDOT reportedly generates insufficient thermoelectric power for practical use. This work tried to improve the Seebeck coefficient by introducing molecular strain to PEDOT molecules by loading a Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-free PEDOT on a Polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) fiber. Raman spectroscopy revealed the PEDOT materials with significant compression in the C{\alpha}-C{\alpha} bond and extension in the C{\alpha}=C\b{eta} bond exhibit Seebeck coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than usual. Furthermore, strain in the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} bond strongly correlated with the Seebeck coefficient that varied in a broad range from -2100 to 3100 {\mu}V K-1. This variation indicated that the molecular strain formed a sharp peak or valley around the Fermi level in the density of state (DOS) function, which gradually shifts along with the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} strain. This molecular strain-induced giant Seebeck effect is expected to be an applicable technique for other polythiophene molecules.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Energy Transfer Between Redox-Active Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redox-based electrical conduction in nonconjugated polymers has been explored less than a decade, yet is already showing promise as a new concept for electrical energy transport. Here using monolayers and sub-monolayers of touching micron-sized redox active colloids (RAC) containing high densities of ethyl-viologen (EV) side groups, intercolloid redox-based electron transport was directly observed via fluorescence microscopy. This observation was enabled by the discovery that these RAC exhibit a highly non-linear electrofluorochromism which can be quantitatively coupled to the colloid redox state. By evaluating the quasi-Fickian nature of the charge transfer (CT) kinetics, the apparent CT diffusion coefficient DCT was extracted. Along with addressing more fundamental questions regarding energy transport in colloidal materials, this first real-time real-space imaging of energy transport within monolayers of redox-active colloids may provide insights into energy transfer in flow batteries, and enable design of new forms of conductive polymers for applications including organic electronics.</description>

      <title>Are large language models superhuman chemists?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained.
  However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harm. Here, we introduce "ChemBench," an automated framework for evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of chemists.
  We curated more than 2,700 question-answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human chemists in our study on average. However, the models struggle with some basic tasks and provide overconfident predictions.
  These findings reveal LLMs' impressive chemical capabilities while emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.</description>
