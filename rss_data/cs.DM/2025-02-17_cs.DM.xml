      <title>Consecutive and quasi-consecutive patterns: $\mathrm{des}$-Wilf classifications and generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a correlation between the distribution of descents over permutations that avoid a consecutive pattern and those avoiding the respective quasi-consecutive pattern, as established in this paper, we obtain a complete $\des$-Wilf classification for quasi-consecutive patterns of length up to 4. For equivalence classes containing more than one pattern, we construct various descent-preserving bijections to establish the equivalences, which lead to the provision of proper versions of two incomplete bijective arguments previously published in the literature. Additionally, for two singleton classes, we derive explicit bivariate generating functions using the generalized run theorem.</description>

      <title>Network fault costs based on minimum leaf spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fault-tolerance of networks from both the structural and computational point of view using the minimum leaf number of the corresponding graph $G$, i.e. the minimum number of leaves of the spanning trees of $G$, and its vertex-deleted subgraphs. We investigate networks that are leaf-guaranteed, i.e. which satisfy a certain stability condition with respect to minimum leaf numbers and vertex-deletion. Next to this, our main notion is the so-called fault cost, which is based on the number of vertices that have different degrees in minimum leaf spanning trees of the network and its vertex-deleted subgraphs. We characterise networks with vanishing fault cost via leaf-guaranteed graphs and describe, for any given network $N$, leaf-guaranteed networks containing $N$. We determine for all non-negative integers $k \le 8$ except $1$ the smallest network with fault cost $k$. We also give a detailed treatment of the fault cost $1$ case, prove that there are infinitely many $3$-regular networks with fault cost $3$, and show that for any non-negative integer $k$ there exists a network with fault cost exactly $k$.</description>

      <title>Orientable and negative orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>Sink-free orientations: a local sampler with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For sink-free orientations in graphs of minimum degree at least $3$, we show that there is a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n^{73}/\varepsilon^{72})\log(n/\varepsilon))$, a near-linear time sampling algorithm, and a randomised approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n/\varepsilon)^2\log(n/\varepsilon))$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ is the desired accuracy. All three algorithms are based on a local implementation of the sink popping method (Cohn, Pemantle, and Propp, 2002) under the partial rejection sampling framework (Guo, Jerrum, and Liu, 2019).</description>
