      <title>Short-time behavior of a system ruled by non-Hermitian time-dependent Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-time behavior of the survival probability of a system governed by a time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is derived using to the second order perturbative approach. The resulting expression allows for the analysis of some situations which could be of interest in the field of quantum technology. For example, it becomes possible to predict a quantum Zeno effect even in the presence of decay processes.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric phase with initial state index dependent on space-time curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new way of generating the quantum geometric phase by making the initial base state index dependent on space-time curvature. We prove that the resulting Schr\"odinger equation is identical to the trace form of the Einstein gravitational field equations when we are in the adiabatic approximation. This particular initial condition was proposed in a previous work by the author.</description>

      <title>A 1.5-Query Lower Bound for the Unitary Synthesis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound for the unitary synthesis problem in the so-called 1.5-query setting. Our analysis establishes that any attempt to implement arbitrary n-qubit unitaries via limited oracle access requires resources that exceed the fractional query threshold. This result extends the one-query lower bound of Lombardi, Ma, and Wright (2023) to the fractional query regime, and introduces a conservative and chaining-based approach to handle intermediate query complexities. As a consequence, we derive cryptographic implications, showing that pseudorandom quantum states remain secure against adversaries restricted to 1.5 queries. Our work provides both conceptual clarification of fractional-query complexity and practical insights into the design of quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Born's rule deviations from temporal non-local effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate deviations from Born's rule in quantum systems where the quantum-equilibrium hypothesis, $\rho \neq |\Psi|^2$, fails. Using the quantum-hydrodynamic framework, we show that transit-interference phenomena and intrinsic memory effects induce finite-time non-local correlations, resulting in violations of Born's rule. These effects appear as non-exponential decay in the survival probability of unstable states at intermediate timescales. Our findings challenge conventional interpretations of quantum probability and suggest novel dynamics that could guide future experimental investigations of temporal non-locality.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms to detect ODMR-active defects for quantum sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin defects in two-dimensional materials are a promising platform for quantum sensing. Simulating the defect's optical response and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable candidates. However, existing simulation methods are typically unable to supply the required accuracy. Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an imbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between excited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary condition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether the evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to $S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the final state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the emission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling operator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from spectrum intensity changes. Additionally, we present an improved scheme to evaluate the defect's optical response, building upon previous work. We study these quantum algorithms in the context of the negatively charged boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride. We generate an embedded active space of 18 spatial orbitals using quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and show that the ISC rate imbalance can be detected with as few as 105 logical qubits and $2.2 \times 10^8$ Toffoli gates. By avoiding direct and costly rate calculations, our methods enable faster screening of candidate defects for ODMR activity, advancing the prospect of using quantum simulations to aid the development of high-performing sensing devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walk on a Line with Absorbing Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption of two-state quantum walks on a finite line is investigated. We consider a symmetric configuration, with two sinks located at $N$ and $-N$ and the quantum walker starting in the middle. Elaborating on the results of Konno et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36 241 (2003), we derive closed formulas for the absorption probabilities at the boundaries in the limit of large system size $N$. It is shown that the absorption depends, apart from the coin angle, only on the probability that the initial state is one of the eigenstates of the coin operator. Finally, we perform an extensive numerical investigation for small system size $N$, showing that the convergence to the analytical result is exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>Callan-Symanzik-like equation in information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the jumps in the complexity growth rate (CGR) through the complexity=anything proposal. It is revealed that bulk fields are in charge of the height and the location of these jumps. To put it accurately, their counterparts are divergence of energy momentum tensor, shear viscosity and the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory. The behavior of CGR around these jumps manifests a critical behavior and critical exponents. Moreover, it is figured out that CGR satisfies a Callan-Symanzik-like equation around these jumps. This equation suggests that the speed of information processing could be changed by the scale of energy. Put it another way, by change of the scale of energy one could turn the classical computers into faster processor computers even faster than our current quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic equations concerning physical expectation values have been examined in terms of the real Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics. The considered cases involve complex wave functions, as well as quaternionic wave functions. The consistency of the formalism has been verified in terms of the continuity equation, the classical limit, and generalizations of the quantum Lorentz force, and the Virial theorem. Besides testing the consistency of the real Hilbert space approach, generalized position and angular momentum operators have been introduced, and inspire exciting directions for further research.</description>

      <title>All-mechanical coherence protection and fast control of a spin qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a phononic quantum network, quantum information is stored and processed within stationary nodes defined by solid-state spins, and the information is routed between nodes by phonons. The phonon holds distinct advantages over its electromagnetic counterpart the photon, including smaller device footprints, reduced crosstalk, long coherence times at low temperatures, and strong interactions with both solid-state spins and electromagnetic waves. Enhanced interactions between a phononic cavity and a stationary qubit have been demonstrated in multiple platforms including superconducting qubits, spins in silicon carbide and spins in diamond. However, an outstanding issue is the compatibility between the spin's coupling to the resonant phononic cavity and the simultaneous use of pulse sequences to extend the coherence time of the spin by suppressing the low-frequency environmental noise. Here we demonstrate all-mechanical coherence protection of a solid-state spin qubit, where optical initialization, quantum operations, and readout are performed in a dressed basis that is highly immune to low-frequency noise and compatible with a phononic cavities. We additionally show record-high Rabi frequencies reaching 800 MHz, which allows for ultrafast quantum control. Our results establish a first step for high-fidelity, phonon-mediated quantum gates and represent a crucial advance toward robust on-chip quantum phononic networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Copenhagen: Following the Trail of Decoherence in Feynman's Light Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman's light microscope invites us to reconsider what we thought we knew about quantum reality. Rather than invoking wavefunction collapse to predict the loss of fringes in a monitored interferometer, Feynman analyzes the problem in terms of a disturbance. This approach raises the question of whether the classical world, including its localized particles and definite measurement outcomes, might emerge as the universe evolves smoothly according to \ss. Treating the particle and its environment as an entangled system, unmodified quantum mechanics shows remarkable success toward this end. This is the purview of decoherence theory. The question of wavefunction collapse then becomes one of what we want from the theory. Do we expect it to describe microscopic reality, or do we consider it to be only a tool for predicting measurement outcomes? Both options are uncomfortable. When applied to unmodified quantum mechanics, the first implies that each moment in time branches into a vast number of divergent macroscopic realities. While the second represents, for most practitioners, a weakened view of science. This article is written to be accessible to anyone with an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Chaos and quantum regimes in $n$-photon driven, dissipative bosonic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state dynamical regimes of boundary-driven, dissipative bosonic chains subjected to $n$-photon drives. Using the truncated Wigner approximation, we explore how multi-photon drives shape the interplay between quantum fluctuations, nonlinear interactions, and dissipative processes in such quantum systems. We identify two main regimes: a chaotic hydrodynamic regime characterized by the restoration of a local $\mathbb{U}(1)$ symmetry, photon saturation due to Kerr nonlinearity, and spatial prethermalization effects; and a non-chaotic resonant nonlinear wave (RNW) regime exhibiting sub-Poissonian photon statistics, persistent $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry, and quantum-driven phase decoherence. Our findings reveal the universal nature of the hydrodynamic regime and highlight the RNW regime's sensitivity to boundary driving conditions, suggesting novel routes for quantum state engineering in driven-dissipative quantum devices. These results are experimentally relevant for state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity and Noise Resilience in Two-Qubit Quantum Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel two-qubit quantum magnetometer Hamiltonian optimized for enhanced sensitivity and noise resilience. Compared to existing models, our formulation offers advantages in accuracy, robustness against noise, and entanglement dynamics. Using analytical methods, we derive the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), highlighting its practical viability for magnetic field sensing. Our approach bridges theoretical insights with real-world applicability. We further analyze the performance of the magnetometer with a different initial entangled state, revealing the benefits of entanglement for sensitivity. A comparative analysis with leading research in the field underscores the advancements offered by our proposed design. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our current study and suggest potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Application of Optimal Control to Time-Resolution Protocol for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolution protocol of quantum sensing aims to measure the fast temporal variation of an external field and demands a high field sensitivity in a short interrogation time $\tau$. Since any operation that evolves the quantum state takes time and is counted as part of the interrogation, evaluating the performance of time-resolution protocol requires a complete end-to-end description of the measurement process. In particular, the initial state has to be one of the sensor qubit's eigenstates in the absence of external fields, and the final projective measurements must be performed in the same eigenstate basis. Building upon prior works which proposed limits for time-resolved sensing using a quantum sensor, we apply optimal control theory to optimize the time-resolution protocol. Our analysis indicates that there exists a critical interrogation time $T^*$: when $\tau&lt;T^*$ the optimal protocol is purely bang-bang; when $\tau&gt;T^*$ the optimal protocol involves a singular control during the interrogation. In the short-$\tau$ regime, which is relevant to high time resolution, we propose a ``detune protocol'' that involves only smooth control during the entire interrogation. As the discontinuities of control pose the main obstacles to experimental realization, we expect the presented detune protocol to be practically useful. In the long-$\tau$ regime, the optimal protocol closely resembles the Ramsey sequence; protocols based on maximizing Quantum Fisher Information are constructed to highlight the difference between the theoretically optimal and practically implementable measurements. Effective use of the time-resolution protocol requires a setup where the unknown time-domain signal of interest can be identically and repeatedly generated. As a potentially relevant application, we outline the calibration of baseband flux pulse distortion in the control of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequality Violations Without Entanglement? It's Just Postselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Wang et al. have reported a violation of a Bell inequality without entanglement [arXiv:2507.07756]. We show that their result is an artifact of postselection. It is well known that postselection may yield Bell inequality violations, both in classical toy models and in real experiments with delayed-choice entanglement-swapping. Here we describe a classical analog of Wang et al.'s experiment, and show that it produces essentially the same results as their quantum version. We explain in detail why neither version is a challenge to Local Causality or local realism: the postselection entails a rejection of Bell's assumption of Statistical Independence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Limited Spatial Resolution of NV-Diamond Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable ensembles of solid-state defects, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, are a leading modality for imaging-based magnetometry, thermometry and strain sensing. However, monitoring the fluorescence of individual defects within a sub-diffraction ensemble remains an outstanding challenge that currently limits access to atomic-scale features and dynamics. For compact clusters of NVs, imaging-based atomic sensing may be formulated as a low-dimensional multiparameter estimation task in which one seeks to localize each defect and quantify the field strength in its immediate vicinity. In this work, we employ optical spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) to enhance localization and brightness estimation accuracy at sub-diffraction scales. Specifically, we develop a two-stage sensing protocol that augments direct imaging by projecting the incoming optical field onto point spread function (PSF)-adapted spatial modes and Yuen-Kennedy-Lax (YKL) spatial modes, enabling efficient extraction of emitter positions and brightnesses. We numerically evaluate the statistical performance of our protocol for sub-diffraction optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and Rabi sensing experiments. Compared to conventional focal plane intensity measurements, our protocol improves emitter localization accuracy by $6\times$ and brightness estimation accuracy by $2\times$ for tightly confined ensembles, residing well below the diffraction limit.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Typical Thermal States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of generative neural networks recently adopted from machine learning have provided promising strategies for studying quantum matter. In particular, the success of autoregressive models in natural language processing has motivated their use as variational ans\"atze, with the hope that their demonstrated ability to scale will transfer to simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we introduce an autoregressive framework to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum system based on the imaginary-time evolution of an ensemble of pure states. We find that established approaches based on minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) have numerical instabilities when an autoregressive recurrent neural network is used as the variational ans\"atz. We show that these instabilities can be mitigated by evolving the initial ensemble states with a unitary operation, along with applying a threshold to curb runaway evolution of ensemble members. By comparing our algorithm to exact results for the spin 1/2 quantum XY chain, we demonstrate that autoregressive typical thermal states are capable of accurately calculating thermal observables.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resilient Spatial Search with Lackadaisical Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks are a powerful framework for the development of quantum algorithms, with lackadaisical quantum walks (LQWs) standing out as an efficient model for spatial search. In this work, we investigate how broken-link decoherence affects the performance of LQW-based search on a two-dimensional toroidal grid. We show through numerical simulations that, while decoherence drives the loopless walk toward a uniform distribution and eliminates its search capability, the inclusion of self-loops significantly mitigates this effect. In particular, even under noise, the marked vertex remains identifiable with probability well above uniform, demonstrating that self-loops enhance the robustness of LQWs in realistic scenarios. These findings extend the known advantages of LQWs from the noiseless setting to noisy environments, consolidating self-loops as a valuable resource for designing resilient quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement verification with convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) via machine learning has received scant attention. Here, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as CNNs enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) to detect GME. We randomly generated GME states with 4 to 6 qubits and GHZ-diagonal states ranging from 4 to 20 qubits using the semidefinite programming approach. Subsequently, we assessed their classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the integration of the SE module significantly improved training performance. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of false positive and false negative occurrences. Utilizing our training data, we have substantially reduced the likelihood of incorrectly classifying non-entangled states as entangled.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for experiments exploring the Poincar\'e quantum recurrence theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\'e revivals.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic freedom of dephased charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, small-scale energy storage devices based on quantum systems, offer the potential for enhanced charging performance through quantum effects such as coherence and collectivity. In this work, we study the collective charging of a quantum battery consisting of N qubits, coupled to a driven qubit charger in a star configuration, with controlled pure dephasing acting on the charger. We investigate how an "asymptotic freedom"-like behavior, in which all the energy deposited into the battery can be extracted as work, resulting in the ergotropy-to-energy ratio approaching unity, can emerge in the steady state of the battery. We show that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio increases with the number of qubits and approaches unity asymptotically as 1 - O(1/N). In the large-N limit, the emergence of approximate ground-state degeneracy of the collective battery system leads to this asymptotic freedom behavior, despite the battery state remaining mixed. We also discuss the scaling behavior of the charging time of the battery with N.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odingerization for quantum linear systems problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum algorithm for linear algebraic equations Ax=b from the perspective of Schr\"odingerization-form problems, which are characterized by a system of linear convection equations in one higher dimension. When A is positive definite, the solution x can be interpreted as the steady-state solution of linear ODEs. This ODE can be solved by using the LCHS method in [1], which serves as the continuous implementation of the Fourier transform in the Schr\"odingerization method from [2,3] Schr\"odingerization transforms linear PDEs and ODEs with non-unitary dynamics into Schr\"odinger-type systems via the warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Compared to the LCHS method, Schr\"odingerization may be more appealing to the PDE community, as it is better suited for leveraging established computational PDE techniques to develop quantum algorithms. When A is a general Hermitian matrix, the inverse matrix can still be represented in the LCHS form in [1], but with a kernel function based on the Fourier approach in [4]. Although this LCHS form provides the steady-state solution of linear ODEs associated with the least-squares equation, applying Schr\"odingerization to this least-squares is not appropriate, as it results in a much larger condition number. We demonstrate that in both cases, the solution x can be expressed as the LCHS of Schr\"odingerization-form problems, or equivalently, as the steady-state solution to a Schr\"odingerization-form problem. This highlights the potential of Schr\"odingerization in quantum scientific computation. We provide a detailed, along with several numerical tests that validate the correctness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we develop a quantum preconditioning algorithm that combines the BPX multilevel preconditioner with our method to address the finite element discretization of the Poisson equation.</description>

      <title>Portfolio construction using a sampling-based variational quantum scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient and effective construction of portfolios that adhere to real-world constraints is a challenging optimization task in finance. We investigate a concrete representation of the problem with a focus on design proposals of an Exchange Traded Fund. We evaluate the sampling-based CVaR Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), combined with a local-search post-processing, for solving problem instances that beyond a certain size become classically hard. We also propose a problem formulation that is suited for sampling-based VQA. Our utility-scale experiments on IBM Heron processors involve 109 qubits and up to 4200 gates, achieving a relative solution error of 0.49%. Results indicate that a combined quantum-classical workflow achieves better accuracy compared to purely classical local search, and that hard-to-simulate quantum circuits may lead to better convergence than simpler circuits. Our work paves the path to further explore portfolio construction with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Many-Body Zeno Effect in monitored Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random quantum states are essential for various applications in quantum information science. Prior approaches of generating genuine random states rely on a large bath to thermalize the system, such that a subsequent measurement on the bath post-selects a random state for the system. To reduce the size of the required bath, we propose an alternative approach based on holographic deep thermalization driven by Hamiltonian evolution, combined with mid-circuit measurements. By trading spatial and time resources, our approach achieves genuine randomness with a bath of constant size that is independent of the system size. We quantify randomness with the frame potential and analyze its dynamics throughout the evolution. Given a total evolution time, as we increase the number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential initially decreases exponentially with the number of measurements, due to the mechanism of holographic deep thermalization. Past a critical number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential rises again, signaling the onset of the quantum Zeno effect. We provide analytical results for the asymptotic behavior of the frame potential, which are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Our findings offer practical guidance for generating Haar-random ensembles through Hamiltonian evolution and controlled measurement.</description>

      <title>PennyLane-Lightning MPI: A massively scalable quantum circuit simulator based on distributed computing in CPU clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulations play a critical role in bridging the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and their practical realization on physical quantum hardware, yet they face computational challenges due to the exponential growth of quantum state spaces with increasing qubit size. This work presents PennyLane-Lightning MPI, an MPI-based extension of the PennyLane-Lightning suite, developed to enable scalable quantum circuit simulations through parallelization of quantum state vectors and gate operations across distributed-memory systems. The core of this implementation is an index-dependent, gate-specific parallelization strategy, which fully exploits the characteristic of individual gates as well as the locality of computation associated with qubit indices in partitioned state vectors. Benchmarking tests with single gates and well-designed quantum circuits show that the present method offers advantages in performance over general methods based on unitary matrix operations and exhibits excellent scalability, supporting simulations of up to 41-qubit with hundreds of thousands of parallel processes. Being equipped with a Python plug-in for seamless integration to the PennyLane framework, this work contributes to extending the PennyLane ecosystem by enabling high-performance quantum simulations in standard multi-core CPU clusters with no library-specific requirements, providing a back-end resource for the cloud-based service framework of quantum computing that is under development in the Republic of Korea.</description>

      <title>Quantum state engineering of maximally entangled photon pairs by path identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting-edge quantum technologies lean on sources of high-dimensional entangled states (HDES) that reliably prepare high-fidelity target states. The idea to overlap photon paths from distinct but indistinguishable sources was recently introduced for the creation of HDES, known as entanglement by path identity. In this regard, the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is promising, as they offer a high-dimensional and discrete Hilbert space to encode information. While entanglement by path identity with OAM has been verified experimentally, a detailed investigation of how the OAM distribution of photon pairs can be engineered to maximize the entanglement is lacking. We address this gap and identify an optimal dimensionality for maximally entangled states (MESs) when the spatial engineering of pump beam and the path identity approach are combined. Our theoretical study reveals notable limitations for the fidelity of high-dimensional target states and also establishes their equivalence to entangled biphoton states pumped by a spatially engineered beam. These findings constitute a valuable step toward the optimized preparation of MESs in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>HOPSO: A Robust Classical Optimizer for VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is one of few approaches where the hope for near-term quantum advantage concentrates. However, they face challenges connected with measurement stochastic noise, barren plateaus, and optimization difficulties in periodic parameter spaces. While most of the efforts concentrates on optimizing the quantum part of the procedure, here we aim to enhance the classical optimization by utilizing a modified version of Harmonic Oscillator-based Particle Swarm Optimization (HOPSO). By adapting its dynamics to respect the periodicity of quantum parameters and enhance noise resilience, we show its strengths on hydrogen (H2) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecules modeled as 4- and 8-qubit Hamiltonians. HOPSO achieves competitive ground-state energy approximations and demonstrates improved robustness compared to COBYLA, Differential Evolution (DE), and standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods in all situations and outperforms other methods under realistic noise conditions. These results suggest that a properly tailored classical part of VQE algorithms can tackle with current problems and gives hope for its scalability for larger systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of nano-diamonds with a single NV center: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we discuss the design considerations for a high-precision enhanced-coherence nanodiamond source, review the fabrication processes used to produce nanodiamond pillars measuring 40 x 65 x 80 nm, summarize the characterization work completed to date, and conclude with an outlook on the remaining steps needed to finalize the source fabrication. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>Towards a Twisted Atom Laser: Cold Atoms Released from Helical Optical Tube Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of cold atoms initially confined in a Helical Optical Tube (HOT) and subsequently released into free space. This helicoidal potential, engineered via structured light fields with orbital angular momentum, imposes a twisted geometry on the atomic ensemble during confinement. We examine how this geometry shapes the initial quantum state particularly its spatial localization and phase structure and how these features influence the subsequent free evolution. Our analysis reveals that the overall confinement geometry supports the formation of spatially coherent, structured wavepackets, paving the way for the realization of twisted Bose Einstein condensates and directed atom lasers. The results are of particular interest for applications in quantum technologies, such as coherent atom beam shaping, matter-wave interferometry, and guided transport of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Parametric feedback cooling of librations of a nanodiamond in a Paul trap: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds (NDs) as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes) to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here, we present a theoretical study concerning the impact of rotations of the ND on the interferometric contrast. We have previously shown that for a first-generation Stern-Gerlach interferometer with an ND composed of 10^7 atoms, it is sufficient to cool the center of mass to milli-Kelvin temperatures. In this work, we similarly show that rotation does not have to be cooled to the ground state, and cooling to hundreds of rotational phonons is good enough. We describe and simulate parametric feedback cooling of librational modes of a charged ND levitated in a Paul trap. The cooling is performed by modulating the electric field of the trap. We examine the dependence of the efficiency of cooling on the electric potential and the shape of the object. We show that the required libration temperatures should be within reach in the very near future. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>

      <title>Entanglement witnesses for stabilizer states and subspaces beyond qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement is arguably the most valuable form of entanglement in the multipartite case, with applications, for instance, in quantum metrology. In order to detect that form of entanglement in multipartite quantum states, one typically uses entanglement witnesses. The aim of this paper is to generalize the results of [G. T\'oth and O. G\"uhne, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{72}, 022340 (2005)] in order to provide a construction of witnesses of genuine multipartite entanglement tailored to entangled subspaces originating from the \textit{multi-qudit} stabilizer formalism -- a framework well known for its role in quantum error correction, which also provides a very convenient description of a broad class of entangled multipartite states (both pure and mixed). Our construction includes graph states of arbitrary local dimension. We then show that in certain situations, the obtained witnesses detecting genuine multipartite entanglement in quantum systems of higher local dimension are superior in terms of noise robustness to those derived for multiqubit states.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sampling and Moment Estimation for Transformed Gaussian Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for efficiently sampling transformed Gaussian random fields on $d$-dimensional domains, based on an enhanced version of the classical moving average method. Pointwise transformations enforcing boundedness are essential for using Gaussian random fields in quantum computation and arise naturally, for example, in modeling coefficient fields representing microstructures in partial differential equations. Generating this microstructure from its few statistical parameters directly on the quantum device bypasses the input bottleneck. Our method enables an efficient quantum representation of the resulting random field and prepares a quantum state approximating it to accuracy $\mathtt{tol} &gt; 0$ in time $\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{polylog} \mathtt{tol}^{-1})$. Combined with amplitude estimation and a quantum pseudorandom number generator, this leads to algorithms for estimating linear and nonlinear observables, including mixed and higher-order moments, with total complexity $\mathcal{O}(\mathtt{tol}^{-1} \operatorname{polylog} \mathtt{tol}^{-1})$. We illustrate the theoretical findings through numerical experiments on simulated quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-independent bounds on state transformations and precision in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive dynamics-independent upper bounds on achievable quantum state transformations. Modeling the evolution as a joint unitary on the system and its environment, we show that the R\'enyi divergence between the initial system state and any state reachable via the dynamics is bounded from above by a quantity determined solely by the eigenvalues of the initial system and environment density operators. As a consequence, we establish dynamics-independent lower bounds on the relative variance for arbitrary measurements, which parallel thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Moreover, we obtain dynamics- and measurement-independent lower bounds on the variance of parameter estimators. These results depend only on the initial eigenvalues of the system and environment and hold for any joint unitary, providing computable bounds for open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Scalable Simulation of Cavity-Based Networks in Modular Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity-mediated interconnects are a promising platform for scaling modular quantum computers by enabling high-fidelity inter-chip quantum state transmission and entanglement generation. In this work, we first model the dynamics of deterministic inter-chip quantum state transfer using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) protocol, analyzing fidelity loss mechanisms under experimentally achievable qubit-cavity coupling and decoherence parameters. We then extend the NetSquid simulator, typically used for simulating long-range quantum communication networks, to support cavity-based communication channels for mediating inter-chip state transfer and entanglement generation. We model cavities as amplitude damping channels parameterized by physical system characteristics; cavity decay rate k and qubit-cavity coupling strength g, and analyze the impact of intrinsic qubit decoherence factors dictated by T1 and T2 times. Our simulations accurately represent the system's dynamics in both strong and weak coupling regimes, and identify critical trade-offs between fidelity, latency, and noise factors. The proposed framework supports faithful modeling and scalable simulation of modular architectures, and provides insights into design optimization for practical quantum network implementations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonreciprocal Noise Transfer under Onsager-Casimir Symmetry in Synthetic-Field Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optomechanical system of fundamental importance consists of two intercoupled mechanical resonators, which are radiation-pressure coupled individually to a photonic cavity. This closed-loop and overall lossy configuration possesses two exceptional points (EPs) and offers the realization of synthetic magnetism, controlled by the loop phase. To elucidate the intricate role of loop phase and EPs in this setting, we analyze the noise power spectral density profiles of internal as well as output fluctuations. In the presence of a synthetic magnetic field, the non-reciprocal routing of a signal is well-known. Here, we further show that this also applies to non-reciprocal backaction noise flow when the time-reversal symmetry is broken, while the Onsager-Casimir symmetry still holds. To better quantify this phenomenon, we introduce a non-reciprocity measure that contrasts the time-reversed counterparts as a function of loop-phase. We observe that non-reciprocal noise flow is enhanced for smaller intermechanical couplings at the expense of lower sensitivity, whereas for sensing purposes, using a higher intermechanical coupling constant is the more viable option.</description>

      <title>Qudit-based scalable quantum algorithm for solving the integer programming problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer programming (IP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that is widely used to represent a diverse set of real-world problems spanning multiple fields, such as finance, engineering, logistics, and operations research. It is a hard problem to solve using classical algorithms, as its complexity increases exponentially with problem size. Most quantum algorithms for solving IP are highly resource inefficient because they encode integers into qubits. In [1], the issue of resource inefficiency was addressed by mapping integer variables to qudits. However, [1] has limited practical value due to a lack of scalability to multiple qudits to encode larger problems. In this work, by extending upon the ideas of [1], a circuit-based scalable quantum algorithm is presented using multiple interacting qudits for which we show a quantum speed-up. The quantum algorithm consists of a distillation function that efficiently separates the feasible from the infeasible regions, a phase-amplitude encoding for the cost function, and a quantum phase estimation coupled with a multi-controlled single-qubit rotation for optimization. We prove that the optimal solution has the maximum probability of being measured in our algorithm. The time complexity for the quantum algorithm is shown to be $O(d^{n/2} + m\cdot n^2\cdot \log{d} + n/\epsilon_{QPE})$ for a problem with the number of variables $n$ taking $d$ integer values, satisfying $m$ constraints with a precision of $\epsilon_{QPE}$. Compared to the classical time complexity of brute force $O(d^n)$ and the best classical exact algorithm $O((\log{n})^{3n})$, it incurs a reduction of $d^{n/2}$ in the time complexity in terms of $n$ for solving a general polynomial IP problem.</description>

      <title>Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first-ever to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.</description>

      <title>Guided sampling ans\"atzes for variational quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising technology because of the ability of quantum computers to process vector spaces with dimensions that increase exponentially with the simulated system size. Extracting the solution, however, is challenging as the number of quantum gate operations and quantum circuit executions must still scale at most polynomially. Consequently, choosing a good ansatz--a polynomial subset of the exponentially many possible solutions--will be critical to maintain accuracy for larger systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a class of guided sampling ans\"atzes (GSAs) that depend on the system interactions and measured state samples as well as a parameter space. We demonstrate a minimal ansatz for the hydronium cation H$_3$O$^+$ and found that with only 200 circuit executions per structure on the IonQ Aria quantum computer, our calculations produced total energies around the relaxed structure with errors well below $1.59\times10^{-3}$ Ha, thus exceeding chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Phase-Driven Precision Boost in Quantum Compression for Postselected Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil the noncyclic Pancharatnam phase as a fundamental geometric criterion governing the optimal operation of quantum compression channels in postselected metrology. Harnessing this phase enables precise control over the interplay between orthogonal parameter sensitivity and parallel evolution in the meter state, thereby maximizing the quantum Fisher information per trial. Strikingly, fine-tuning the postselection parameter just below this optimal phase incurs substantial information loss, whereas tuning it just above fully suppresses undesired parallel evolution and boosts information retention by more than a tenfold factor relative to conventional approaches. We further reveal that leveraging qudit meter states can unlock a substantial additional quantum advantage. These findings establish the Pancharatnam phase as an essential and robust geometric benchmark, guiding the design of next-generation high-precision quantum parameter estimation protocols under realistic experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Portfolio Optimization via Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Dicke State Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13954v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a fundamental challenge in various domains, with portfolio optimization standing out as a key application in finance. Despite numerous quantum algorithmic approaches proposed for this problem, most overlook a critical feature of realistic portfolios: diversification. In this work, we introduce a novel quantum framework for multiclass portfolio optimization that explicitly incorporates diversification by leveraging multiple parametrized Dicke states, simultaneously initialized to encode the diversification constraints , as an ansatz of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. A key strength of this ansatz is that it initializes the quantum system in a superposition of only feasible states, inherently satisfying the constraints. This significantly reduces the search space and eliminates the need for penalty terms. In addition, we also analyze the impact of different classical optimizers in this hybrid quantum-classical approach. Our findings demonstrate that, when combined with the CMA-ES optimizer, the Dicke state ansatz achieves superior performance in terms of convergence rate, approximation ratio, and measurement probability. These results underscore the potential of this method to solve practical, diversification-aware portfolio optimization problems relevant to the financial sector.</description>

      <title>Adversarially robust quantum state learning and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state learning is a fundamental problem in physics and computer science. As near-term quantum devices are error-prone, it is important to design error-resistant algorithms. Apart from device errors, other unexpected factors could also affect the algorithm, such as careless human read-out error, or even a malicious hacker deliberately altering the measurement results. Thus, we want our algorithm to work even in the worst case when things go against our favor.
  We consider the practical setting of single-copy measurements and propose the $\gamma$-adversarial corruption model where an imaginary adversary can arbitrarily change $\gamma$-fraction of the measurement outcomes. This is stronger than the $\gamma$-bounded SPAM noise model, where the post-measurement state changes by at most $\gamma$ in trace distance. Under our stronger model of corruption, we design an algorithm using non-adaptive measurements that can learn an unknown rank-$r$ state up to $\tilde{O}(\gamma\sqrt{r})$ in trace distance, provided that the number of copies is sufficiently large. We further prove an information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(\gamma\sqrt{r})$ for non-adaptive measurements, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithm. Our upper and lower bounds also hold for quantum state testing, where the goal is to test whether an unknown state is equal to a given state or far from it.
  Our results are intriguingly optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. For general states, the error is dimension-dependent and $\gamma\sqrt{d}$ in the worst case, meaning that only corrupting a very small fraction ($1/\sqrt{d}$) of the outcomes could totally destroy any non-adaptive learning algorithm. However, for constant-rank states that are useful in many quantum algorithms, it is possible to achieve dimension-independent error, even in the worst-case adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>Programmable Anyon Mobility through Higher Order Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling anyon mobility is critical for robust quantum memory and understanding symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases with subsystem symmetries (e.g., line-like, fractal, chaotic, or mixed supports). However, a unified framework for anyon mobility in SET phases with such diverse geometric patterns of symmetry supports has remained a major challenge. In this Letter, by introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer science tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete characterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem symmetries. First, we design finite-depth HOCA-controlled unitary quantum circuits, yielding exactly solvable SET models with Abelian anyons and all possible locally generated subsystem symmetries. Then, we present a theorem that precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully mobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete characterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem yields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation during fusion. Fusion rules with multiple channels are identified, exhibiting non-Abelian characteristics in Abelian anyon systems. Leveraging HOCA, this Letter opens new avenues for characterization of SET phases of matter and programmability of topological quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Brace for impact: ECDLP challenges for quantum cryptanalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise suites of benchmarks are required to assess the progress of early fault-tolerant quantum computers at economically impactful applications such as cryptanalysis. Appropriate challenges exist for factoring but those for elliptic curve cryptography are either too sparse or inadequate for standard applications of Shor's algorithm. We introduce a difficulty-graded suite of elliptic curve discrete logarithm (ECDLP) challenges that use Bitcoin's curve $y^{2}=x^{3}+7 \pmod p$ while incrementally lowering the prime field from 256 down to 6 bits. For each bit-length, we provide the prime, the base point and an example public key. All challenges are generated by a deterministic, reproducible procedure. We calibrate classical cost against Pollard's rho records and quantum cost against resource estimation results for Shor's algorithm. We compile Shor's ECDLP circuit to logical counts and map them to physical resources for various parameters of the surface code, the repetition cat code and the LDPC cat codes. Under explicit and testable assumptions on physical error rates, code distances, and non-Clifford supply, our scenarios place the full 256-bit instance within a 2027--2033 window. The challenge ladder thus offers a transparent ruler to track fault-tolerant progress on a cryptanalytic target of immediate relevance, and it motivates proactive migration of digital assets to post-quantum signatures.</description>

      <title>Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum biosensing on a multiplexed functionalized diamond microarray</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way, avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip, enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in complex biological environments.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Gold-Standard Chemical Database 138 (GSCDB138): A diverse set of accurate energy differences for assessing and developing density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GSCDB138, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 138 data sets (8383 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and barrier heights, non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities, electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values; redundant, spincontaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new, property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density-functional approximations shows the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall, yet reveals interesting exceptions: r2SCAN-D4 (meta-GGA) rivals hybrids for frequencies, and electric-field errors correlate poorly with ground-state energetics. {\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the metaGGA and GGA classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment. GSCDB138 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and machine-learned functionals.</description>

      <title>HBAR entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we extend the Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) framework to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Real-time bubble nucleation and growth for false vacuum decay on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we theoretically investigate the false vacuum decay process in a ferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 chain. We develop a many-body theory describing the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and characterized in terms of observable quantities.</description>

      <title>Properties of the temporal transfer matrix in integrable Floquet circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13883v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One possible approach to studying non-equilibrium dynamics is the so-called influence matrix (IM) formalism. The influence matrix can be viewed as a quantum state that encodes complete information about the non-equilibrium dynamics of a boundary degree of freedom. It has been shown that the IM is the unique stationary point of the temporal transfer matrix. This transfer matrix, however, is non-diagonalizable and exhibits a non-trivial Jordan block structure. In this article, we demonstrate that, in the case of an integrable XXZ spin chain, the temporal transfer matrix itself is integrable and can be embedded into a family of commuting operators. We further provide the exact expression for the IM as a particular limit of a Bethe wavefunction, with the corresponding Bethe roots given explicitly. We also focus on the special case of the free-fermionic XX chain. In this setting, we uncover additional local integrals of motion, which enable us to analyze the dimensions and structure of the Jordan blocks, as well as the locality properties of the IM. Moreover, we construct a basis of quasi-local creation operators that generate the IM from the vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for Open Quantum Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches such as singular value decomposition. Here, we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, effectively identifies chaotic and integrable phases in open quantum systems. The results align with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, highlighting the robustness of this approach. The universality of our findings is further supported through studies of both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete characterization and quantification of entanglement, particularly the multipartite entanglement, remains an unfinished long-term goal in quantum information theory. As long as the multipartite system is concerned, the relation between the entanglement contained in different partitions or different subsystems need to take into account. The complete multipartite entanglement measure and the complete monogamy relation is a framework that just deals with such a issue. In this paper, we put forward conditions to justify whether the multipartite entanglement monotone (MEM) and genuine multipartite entanglement monotone (GMEM) are complete, completely monogamous, and tightly complete monogamous according to the feature of the reduced function. Especially, with the assumption that the maximal reduced function is nonincreasing on average under LOCC, we proposed a class of complete MEMs and a class of complete GMEMs via the maximal reduced function for the first time. By comparison, it is shown that, for the tripartite case, this class of GMEMs is better than the one defined from the minimal bipartite entanglement in literature under the framework of complete MEM and complete monogamy relation. In addition, the relation between monogamy, complete monogamy, and the tightly complete monogamy are revealed in light of different kinds of MEMs and GMEMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider two-sender, one-receiver communication over a discrete memoryless multiple-access channel without feedback, where two senders may cooperate on channel coding by using pre-shared resources, such as shared randomness, quantum states and measurements, or nonlocal correlations. We present the capacity region when senders employ cooperative encoding with quantum and nonlocal resources, extending beyond shared randomness, and derive a sum rate that serves as a lower bound to the sum capacity, the lower bound is computable by exploiting specific strategies. We also compute the sum capacities for two instances. One is when senders apply local resources for cooperative encoding. The other is when senders exploit non-classical resources for encoding against channels constructed by referring to nonlocal games, in this way, correlated noise other than independent errors occurs on codewords. Comparing the exact sum capacities and lower bounds, we show that nonlocal and quantum resources for cooperative encoding enable higher sum capacities over local ones. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and magic square games are considered for constructing multiple-access channels, and we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlocal and quantum resources to achieve higher sum capacities.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

Abstract: To implement a quantum error correction protocol, we first need a scheme to prepare our state in the correct subspace of the code, and this can be done using a unitary encoding circuit. Majorana codes are special since any gates that transform such codes must preserve fermionic parity. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses the stabilizer matrix to compute unitary encoding circuits for Majorana codes. We present two approaches, both of which use a version of Gaussian elimination with row operations replaced with elementary fermionic Clifford operations. One approach uses an additional ancilla mode and works for all Majorana stabilizer codes, while the second approach does not use ancilla but does not work if the total parity is inside the stabilizer group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge, as these operate at fixed frequency. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. We numerically compute its density-density correlations, predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>

Abstract: We prove that QMA where the verifier may also make a single non-collapsing measurement is equal to NEXP, resolving an open question of Aaronson. We show this is a corollary to a modified proof of QMA+ = NEXP [arXiv:2306.13247]. At the core of many results inspired by Blier and Tapp [arXiv:0709.0738] is an unphysical property testing problem deciding whether a quantum state is close to an element of a fixed basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers that are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We focus on nuclear-physics applications and consider a qubit-efficient mapping on the lattice, which can efficiently represent the large volumes required for realistic scattering simulations. For the case of a contact interaction, we develop an algorithm for time evolution based on the Trotter approximation that scales logarithmically with the lattice size, and is combined with quantum phase estimation. We eventually focus on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We also investigate ground-state preparation and examine the total circuit depth required for a realistic calculation and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</description>

      <title>A robust and composable device-independent protocol for oblivious transfer using (fully) untrusted quantum devices in the bounded storage model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust and composable device-independent (DI) quantum protocol between two parties for oblivious transfer (OT) using Magic Square devices in the bounded storage model in which the (honest and cheating) devices and parties have no long-term quantum memory. After a fixed constant (real-world) time interval, referred to as DELAY, the quantum states decohere completely. The adversary (cheating party), with full control over the devices, is allowed joint (non-IID) quantum operations on the devices, and there are no time and space complexity bounds placed on its powers. The running time of the honest parties is polylog({\lambda}) (where {\lambda} is the security parameter). Our protocol has negligible (in {\lambda}) correctness and security errors and can be implemented in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era. By robustness, we mean that our protocol is correct even when devices are slightly off (by a small constant) from their ideal specification. This is an important property since small manufacturing errors in the real-world devices are inevitable. Our protocol is sequentially composable and, hence, can be used as a building block to construct larger protocols (including DI bit-commitment and DI secure multi-party computation) while still preserving correctness and security guarantees.
  None of the known DI protocols for OT in the literature are robust and secure against joint quantum attacks. This was a major open question in device-independent two-party distrustful cryptography, which we resolve.
  We prove a parallel repetition theorem for a certain class of entangled games with a hybrid (quantum-classical) strategy to show the security of our protocol. The hybrid strategy helps to incorporate DELAY in our protocol. This parallel repetition theorem is a main technical contribution of our work.</description>

      <title>Erasure-tolerance scheme for the surface codes on neutral atom quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays manipulated with optical tweezers are promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computers due to their advantageous properties, such as scalability, long coherence times, and optical accessibility for communication. A significant challenge to overcome is the presence of non-Pauli errors, specifically erasure errors and leakage errors. Previous work has shown that leakage errors can be converted into erasure errors; however, these (converted) erasure errors continuously occur and accumulate over time. Prior proposals have involved transporting atoms directly from a reservoir area--where spare atoms are stored--to the computational area--where computation and error correction are performed--to correct atom loss. While coherent transport is promising, it may not address all challenges--particularly its effectiveness in dense arrays and alternative methods must help. In this study, we evaluate the effects of erasure errors on the surface code using circuit-based Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate depolarizing and accumulated erasure errors. We propose a new scheme to mitigate this problem: a k-shift erasure recovery scheme. Our scheme employs code deformation to repeatedly transfer the logical qubit from an imperfect array with accumulated erased qubits to a perfect array, thereby tolerating many accumulated erasures. Furthermore, our scheme corrects erasure errors in the atom arrays while the logical qubits are evacuated from the area being corrected; thus, manipulating optical tweezers for erasure correction does not disturb the qubits that constitute the logical data. Our scheme provides a practical pathway for neutral atom quantum computers to achieve feasible fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Heat Statistics with the Reaction Coordinate Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definition of heat in quantum mechanics is ambiguous. Complications arise in particular when the coupling between a quantum system and a thermal environment is non-negligible, as the boundary between the two becomes blurred, making the distinction between system and environment difficult to draw. The reaction coordinate mapping can be used in such regimes to redraw the boundary between the system and environment. In this paper we combine the reaction coordinate technique with a two-point measurement protocol to compare two different definitions of heat: energetic changes with respect to the full environment Hamiltonian (prior to the mapping), and energetic changes with respect to the residual environment Hamiltonian (after the mapping). We find that the latter definition displays behaviour more expected of a heat bath in the highly non-Markovian regime considered.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Structures in Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the implications of applying the formalism of symplectic geometry to quantum mechanics, particularly focusing on many-particle systems. We extend the concept of a symplectic indicator of entanglement, originally introduced by Sawicki et al. \cite{sawicki2011}, to these complex systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that the restriction of the symplectic structure to manifolds comprising all states characterized by isospectral reduced one-particle density matrices, \( M_{\mu(\psi)}^0 \), exhibits degeneracy for non-separable states. We prove that the degree of degeneracy at any given state \( \ket{\varphi} \in M_{\mu(\psi)}^0 \) corresponds to the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic form \( \omega \) when restricted to the manifold of states that are locally unitary equivalent with \( \ket{\varphi} \). Additionally, we provide a physical interpretation of this symplectic indicator of entanglement, articulating it as an inherent ambiguity within the associated classical dynamical framework. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of symplectic geometry in elucidating entanglement properties in quantum mechanics and suggest avenues for further exploration into the geometric structures underlying quantum state spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a ''quantum microscope'' for qubits based on nonlinear discrete-time chaotic dynamics, which exponentially amplifies the initially small fidelity of a pair of states to a large saturation value ( $\sim$ 1/2), thereby pushing the Helstrom bound to more accessible values. We show that Bell-type temporal correlations can capture even the minutest differences between two initial states, thus enabling their distinguishability. The cost of distinguishability is quantified in terms of the characteristic waiting time of the evolution, defined as the time after which the temporal correlation of a given initial state begins to diverge exponentially from that of a nearby state. The closer the two states are, the longer this waiting time becomes. By combining chaos with Bell-type temporal correlations, this approach opens unexplored avenues for pushing the limits of precision in quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes, termed \emph{extended binomial codes}, which generalize the structure of one-mode binomial codes by incorporating ideas from high-rate qubit stabilizer codes. These codes are constructed in close analogy to $[[n,k,d]]$ qubit codes, where the parameter $n$ corresponds to the total excitation budget rather than the number of physical qubits. Our construction achieves a significant reduction in average excitation per mode while preserving error-correcting capabilities, offering improved compatibility with hardware constraints in the strong-dispersive regime. We demonstrate that extended binomial codes not only reduce the mean excitation required for encoding but also simplify syndrome extraction and logical gate implementation, particularly the logical $\bar{X}$ operation. These advantages suggest that extended binomial codes offer a scalable and resource-efficient approach for bosonic quantum error correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are a highly promising tool for efficiently simulating quantum many-body systems. The preparation of their eigenstates is of particular interest and can be addressed, e.g., by quantum phase estimation algorithms. The routine then acts as an effective filtering operation, reducing the energy variance of the initial state. In this work, we present a distributed quantum algorithm inspired by iterative phase estimation to prepare low-variance states. Our method uses a single auxiliary qubit per quantum device, which controls its dynamics, and a postselection strategy for a joint quantum measurement on such auxiliary qubits. In the multi-device case, the result of this measurement heralds the successful runs of the protocol. This allows us to demonstrate that our distributed algorithm reduces the energy variance faster compared to single-device implementations, thereby highlighting the potential of distributed algorithms for near-term and early fault-tolerant devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-partite entanglement, which focus on at most how many particles in the global system are entangled but separable from other particles, is complementary to the $k$-entanglement that reflects how many splitted subsystems are entangled under partitions of the systems in characterizing multipartite entanglement. Very recently, the theory of the complete $k$-entanglement measure has been established in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 012405 (2024)]. Here we investigate whether we can define the complete measure of the $k$-partite entanglement. Consequently, with the same spirit as that of the complete $k$-entanglement measure, we present the axiomatic postulates that a complete $k$-partite entanglement measure should require. Furthermore, we present two classes of $k$-partite entanglement measures and show that one is complete while the other one is unified but not complete except for the case of $k=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a three-level ladder-type atom driven by a coherent field, inspired by the experimental work of Gasparinetti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 033802 (2019)]. When driven on two-photon resonance, the atom is excited into its highest energy state $| f \rangle$ by absorbing two photons simultaneously. The atom then de-excites via a cascaded decay $| f \rangle \rightarrow | e \rangle \rightarrow | g \rangle$. Here we present a theoretical study of the atomic fluorescence spectrum where, upon strong coherent driving, the spectrum exhibits seven distinct frequencies corresponding to transitions amongst the atomic dressed states. We characterize the quantum statistics of the emitted photons by investigating the second-order correlation functions of the emitted field. We do so by considering the total field emitted by the atom and focusing on each of the dressed-state components, taking in particular a secular-approximation and deriving straightforward, transparent analytic expressions for the second-order auto- and cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation using Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. The proposed technique consists of two phases: (i) mapping the continuous CG solution to a feasible 0-1 solution and (ii) applying a constraint-aware local search to improve that solution's quality. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed postprocessing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time. Consequently, the postprocessing enables CG with QA to obtain high-quality approximate solutions faster.</description>

Abstract: We study quenched dynamics of fully-connected spin models. The system is prepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to map the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined in a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical singularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is reflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity in the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the singular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time behavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a reduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a classical form.</description>

      <title>Extracting pairs of time-bin entangled photons from resonance fluorescence</title>

Abstract: Photon-photon entanglement and photon antibunching are fundamental manifestations of the quantum nature of optical light fields, but are typically regarded as distinct phenomena. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that pairs of narrow-band time-bin entangled photons can be naturally extracted from resonance fluorescence. We split the collected fluorescence of a single trapped atom on a 50 : 50 beamsplitter, resulting in strong temporal correlations between photons at the beamsplitter outputs. A time-bin coincidence between the two output modes then projects their state onto a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is evidenced by violating the CHSH-Bell inequality as well as by reconstructing the density matrix of the photon pair. Importantly, we show that the entanglement persists both for weak and strong excitation of the emitter. Our results establish resonance fluorescence as an efficient source of time-bin entangled photon pairs, i.e., a practical and scalable resource for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum collision models with Hamiltonian simulations using early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of the total (system, bath, and interaction) Hamiltonian and intermittent tracing out of the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers: we do not assume access to specialized oracles such as block encodings and minimize the number of ancilla qubits needed. In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. For a system of $n$-qubits, we exhaustively compare the circuit depth needed to estimate the expectation value of an observable with respect to the reduced state of the system after time $t$ while employing different near-term Hamiltonian simulation techniques, requiring at most $n+2$ qubits in all. We compare the CNOT gate counts of the various approaches for estimating the Transverse Field Magnetization of a $10$-qubit XX-Heisenberg spin chain under amplitude damping. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory-retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of simulating open systems dynamics using this framework.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states with such Wigner negativity is a highly sought goal but is challenging as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this form of interaction, by utilizing the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive some properties of the hydrogen atom inside a box with an impenetrable wall that have not been discussed before. Suitable scaling of the Hamiltonian operator proves to be useful for the derivation of some general properties of the eigenvalues. The radial part of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is conditionally solvable and the exact polynomial solutions provide useful information. There are accidental degeneracies that take place at particular values of the box radius, some of which can be determined from the conditionally-solvable condition. Some of the roots stemming from the conditionally-solvable condition appear to converge towards the critical values of the model parameter. This analysis is facilitated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method that provides accurate eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an experimentally feasible nonlinear optical realization of a type of non-integrable phase found in interacting quantum systems at quantum phase transitions. We show that an exotic term in the dynamical equation governs the nonlinear polarization of the optical field along an anisotropic low-birefringence fiber with tetragonal symmetry. Intriguingly, by adiabatically tuning nonlinear susceptibilities along the fibers, the Stokes vector on the Poincar\'e sphere accumulates a non-integrable phase called the Hannay angle, which shares the same geometric gauge structure as that associated with quantum phase transitions. Experimental realization via adiabatically depositing nano-crystals along the fibers is discussed.</description>

      <title>Long-distance device-independent quantum key distribution with standard optics tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key exchange between remote parties without any assumptions on the internal workings of the devices used for its implementation. However, its practical deployment remains severely constrained by the need for loophole-free Bell inequality violations, which are highly susceptible to losses and detection efficiencies. In this paper, we propose two long-distance DI-QKD protocols based on a heralding scheme using single-photon interference. Our protocols consist of only standard quantum optics tools such as two-mode squeezed states, displacement operations and on-off detectors, making them experimentally accessible. To further enhance robustness against realistic imperfections, we integrate a classical noisy preprocessing technique during post-processing. We calculate key rates of the protocols by numerical optimization and show the supremacy of this implementation over existing protocols in terms of communication distances.</description>

      <title>Observation of Purcell Effect in Electrically Coupled Cavity-Magnet System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and $T = 7$ mK show coupling rates as high as $g/2pi = 56$ MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than the one expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Simulation Using Tracking, Uncomputation and Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers have grown in size and qubit quality in recent years, enabling the execution of complex quantum circuits. However, for most researchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This necessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum circuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.
  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for Noisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels accurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy gates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase in circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this overhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and the Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).
  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately represent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit executions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so that $n_{2} &lt; n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation across these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by representing all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf nodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using depth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at several stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of 186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\times$ and $12.53\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\times$ and $439.38\times$ respectively. For larger benchmarks (more than than 15 qubits), the average speedup is $55.42\times$ and $23.03\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q respectively</description>

      <title>Tailored First-order and Interior-point methods and a new semidefinite programming hierarchy for entanglement detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, yet its reliable detection in high-dimensional or noisy systems remains a fundamental computational challenge. Semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies, such as the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) and Extension (EXT) hierarchies, offer complete methods for entanglement detection, but their practical use is limited by exponential growth in problem size. In this paper, we introduce a new SDP hierarchy, PST, that is sandwiched between EXT and DPS--offering a tighter approximation to the set of separable states than EXT, while incurring lower computational overhead than DPS.
  We develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions of EXT and PST using partition mappings and operators. These descriptions in turn yield formulations that satisfy desirable properties such as the Slater condition and are well-suited to both first-order methods (FOMs) and interior-point methods (IPMs). We design a suite of entanglement detection algorithms: three FOMs (Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient, and fast projected gradient) based on a least-squares formulation, and a custom primal-dual IPM based on a conic programming formulation. These methods are numerically stable and capable of producing entanglement witnesses or proximity measures, even in cases where states lie near the boundary of separability.
  Numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states demonstrate that our algorithms improve the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. In particular, the PST hierarchy combined with FOMs enables scalable and effective entanglement detection in relatively easy instances, while our IPM approach offers robustness and early witness recovery for the more difficult ones. Our results highlight the benefits of tailoring algorithmic formulations to hierarchy structure to advance entanglement detection at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, shedding light on the range of validity of the membrane picture in such systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra, and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$ plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V&lt; V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V&gt;V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07381</link>

Abstract: The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic non reciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic non reciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential. In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode \( \text{TE}_{11n} \) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. To validate the reliability of our measurement method, we selected single crystal YIG as the test material, as its magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures are relatively well known. This demonstration confirms that our method is effective for characterizing various low loss ferrite materials that are potential candidates for compact cryogenic non reciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetry in a two-Higgs-doublet model from quantum information and nonstabiliserness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\Phi^+\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.</description>

      <title>Portable Laser-Pumped Rb Atomic Clock with Digital Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing the size and complexity of high-performance timekeeping devices is an ever-growing need for various applications, such as 6G wireless technology, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), Internet of Things (IoT), and ultrafast spectroscopy. This work presents a distributed feedback (DFB) laser-pumped Rb atomic clock, which features extraordinary frequency stability, small size and low power consumption. The DFB laser head employs a built-in isolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. For complete optical pumping of the atoms in the absorption cell, the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 10 mm by using an optical diffuser-based beam expander. The physics package is based on a magnetron microwave cavity and surrounded by two layers of magnetic shielding. The overall volume of the optical system combined with the physics package is 250 cm$^3$. The proposed atomic clock is also designed to operate at a low temperature, whose absorption cell is maintained at 323 K. Benefiting from the lower Rb atom density, the excited atoms present a long population relaxation time of 5.8 ms. The frequency synthesizer and frequency-locked loop are implemented by digital circuits. The short-term stability of the atomic clock is measured to be $1.8\times10^{-12}\tau ^{-1/2}$ (1-100s). Our achievement paves the way for practical application of the laser-pumped Rb atomic clocks.</description>
