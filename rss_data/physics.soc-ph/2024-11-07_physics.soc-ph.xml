      <title>Physical modelling of global macrosystems evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of growth and innovation often exhibit sudden, explosive surges, where systems remain quasi stable for extended periods before accelerating dramatically-often surpassing traditional exponential growth. This pattern is evident across various domains, including world population increases and rapid technological advancements. Although these phenomena share common characteristics, they are driven by different underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to capture these phenomenologies through a theory of combinatorial innovation. Inspired by the Theory of the Adjacent Possible, we model growth and innovation as emerging from the recombination processes of existing elements of a system. By formalizing these qualitative ideas, we provide a mathematical structure that explains diverse phenomena, enables cross-system comparisons, and offers grounded predictions for future growth trajectories. Our approach distils the complexity of innovation into a more accessible yet robust framework, paving the way for a deeper and more flexible mathematical understanding of growth and innovation processes.</description>

      <title>Automation Will Set Occupational Mobility Free: Structural Changes in the Occupation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occupational mobility is an emergent strategy to cope with technological unemployment by facilitating efficient labor redeployment. However, previous studies analyzing networks show that the boundaries to smooth mobility are constrained by a fragmented structure in the occupation network. In this study, positing that this structure will significantly change due to automation, we propose the skill automation view, which asserts that automation substitutes for skills, not for occupations, and simulate a scenario of skill automation drawing on percolation theory. We sequentially remove skills from the occupation-skill bipartite network and investigate the structural changes in the projected occupation network. The results show that the accumulation of small changes (the emergence of bridges between occupations due to skill automation) triggers significant structural changes in the occupation network. The structural changes accelerate as the components integrate into a new giant component. This result suggests that automation mitigates the bottlenecks to smooth occupational mobility.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Universal Human Trajectory Modeling from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</description>

      <title>Where postdoctoral journeys lead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Postdoctoral training is a career stage often described as a demanding and anxiety-laden time when many promising PhDs see their academic dreams slip away due to circumstances beyond their control. We use a unique data set of academic publishing and careers to chart the more or less successful postdoctoral paths. We build a measure of academic success on the citation patterns two to five years into a faculty career. Then, we monitor how students' postdoc positions -- in terms of relocation, change of topic, and early well-cited papers -- relate to their early-career success. One key finding is that the postdoc period seems more important than the doctoral training to achieve this form of success. This is especially interesting in light of the many studies of academic faculty hiring that link Ph.D. granting institutions and hires, omitting the postdoc stage. Another group of findings can be summarized as a Goldilocks principle: it seems beneficial to change one's direction, but not too much.</description>

      <title>Models of Opinion Dynamics with Random Parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups -- people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review and New Analysis Software for Single-file Pedestrian Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive examination of single-file experiments within the field of pedestrian dynamics, providing a review from both theoretical and analytical perspectives. It begins by tracing the historical context of single-file movement studies in pedestrian dynamics. The significance of understanding the fundamental relationships between density, speed, and flow in pedestrian dynamics is explored through the lens of simple single-file systems. Furthermore, we examine various traffic systems involving human or non-human entities such as ants, mice, bicycles, and cars, and provide insights. We explore the types of experimental setups, data collection methods, and factors that influence pedestrian movement. We also define and explain the common concepts related to single-file movement, particularly in experimental research. Finally, we present a Python tool named "SingleFileMovementAnalysis" designed for analyzing single-file experimental data, specifically head trajectories. This tool provides a unified approach for computing movement metrics like speed, density, and headway. The article aims to stimulate further research and underscore the areas where future researchers can contribute to the advancement and improvement of single-file studies.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Voting Models with Varying Speeds of Correlation Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model voting behaviour in the multi-group setting of a two-tier voting system using sequences of de Finetti measures. Our model is defined by using the de Finetti representation of a probability measure (i.e. as a mixture of conditionally independent probability measures) describing voting behaviour. The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviour, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting. These models can be used, e.g., to study the problem of optimal voting weights in two-tier voting systems.</description>

      <title>The low-rank hypothesis of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with intricate interactions among their constituents. To make interpretable predictions about their large-scale behavior, it is typically assumed, without a clear statement, that these dynamics can be reduced to a few number of equations involving a low-rank matrix describing the network of interactions -- what we call the low-rank hypothesis. Our paper sheds light on this assumption and questions its validity. By leveraging fundamental theorems on singular value decomposition, we expose the hypothesis for various random graphs, either by making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the exponential decrease of their singular values. Notably, we verify the hypothesis experimentally for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of their singular values, which has major consequences on their effective ranks. We then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical systems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to prove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and to connect the rapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction error of the nonlinear dynamics they support, be it microbial, neuronal or epidemiological. Finally, we prove that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from the dimension reduction, thus providing theoretical insights into the origin of higher-order interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Initialisation and Network Effects in Decentralised Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully decentralised federated learning enables collaborative training of individual machine learning models on a distributed network of communicating devices while keeping the training data localised on each node. This approach avoids central coordination, enhances data privacy and eliminates the risk of a single point of failure. Our research highlights that the effectiveness of decentralised federated learning is significantly influenced by the network topology of connected devices and the learning models' initial conditions. We propose a strategy for uncoordinated initialisation of the artificial neural networks based on the distribution of eigenvector centralities of the underlying communication network, leading to a radically improved training efficiency. Additionally, our study explores the scaling behaviour and the choice of environmental parameters under our proposed initialisation strategy. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable artificial neural network training in a distributed and uncoordinated environment, offering a deeper understanding of the intertwining roles of network structure and learning dynamics.</description>
