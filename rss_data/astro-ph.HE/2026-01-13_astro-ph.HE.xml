      <title>Masers and Broad-Line Mapping Favor Magnetically-Dominated AGN Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel and powerful constraint on the physics of supermassive black hole (BH) accretion disks. We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \gtrsim 0.01\,$pc or $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $\alpha$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state.</description>

      <title>VLBI Observations of SN 2012au Reveal a Compact Radio Source a Decade Post Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three leading models have been put forth to justify the observed radio re-brightening associated with stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) years post-explosion: radiation from an emerging pulsar wind nebula (PWN), shock interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), or emission from off-axis, relativistic jets. SN~2012au is a particularly intriguing SESN in this regard as observations obtained $\gtrsim$ 6 years post-explosion have shown \emph{both} (i) optical emission features consistent with a young PWN and (ii) a radio re-brightening. We present the results of our Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometric (VLBI) observations of SN 2012au performed between 8 to 13 years post core-collapse. Our VLBI observations reveal a luminous, steadily fading radio source that remains compact ($\leq1.4\times10^{17}~\mathrm{cm}$) and stationary ($\leq0.36c$) over the course of our campaign. Overall, we find that our VLBI measurements can be readily explained by a $\sim$decade-old PWN, potentially explained by shock interaction with specific CSM geometries, and are unlikely to be explained by emission from an off-axis, relativistic jet. Assuming a PWN origin, our observations require that the initial spin-down luminosity of the central pulsar be between $10^{36}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}\leq\dot{E}_0\leq10^{42}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and radio efficiency factor be $\eta_\mathrm{R}\geq3\times10^{-6}$. These results are consistent with independent inferences obtained using optical spectroscopy of SN~2012au, alongside inferences of known Galactic systems. If a PWN origin is confirmed, SN 2012au would represent the first extragalactic PWN emerging from a modern day SN, providing a novel opportunity to study the formation properties of a decade-old pulsar.</description>

      <title>The Role of Interferometric Phase in Measuring Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first images of a black hole using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the near future, extensions of the EHT such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will allow access to finer-scale features, such as a black hole's ''photon ring.'' In the Kerr spacetime, this image structure arises from strong gravitational lensing near the black hole that results in a series of increasingly demagnified images of each emitting region that exponentially converge to a limiting critical curve. Exotic black hole alternatives, such as wormholes, can introduce additional photon rings. Hence, precisely characterizing multi-ring images is a promising pathway for measuring black hole parameters, such as spin, as well as exploring non-Kerr spacetimes. Here, we examine the interferometric response of multi-ring systems using a series of 1) simple geometric toy models, 2) synthetic BHEX and EHT observations of geometric models, and 3) semi-analytic accretion models with ray-tracing in the Kerr spacetime. We find that interferometric amplitude is more sensitive to the shape of the photon ring, while interferometric phase is more sensitive to its displacement, which is most sensitive to black hole spin. We find that for models similar to Messier 87* (M87*), the relative displacement of the first strongly lensed image from the weakly lensed direct image is approximately $1\,\mu {\rm as}$ per unit dimensionless spin, yielding an expected phase signature on a 25 G$\lambda$ baseline of $\sim44^\circ$ per unit spin.</description>

      <title>Radio Signatures of Cosmic-Ray Particle Showers in Deep In-Ice Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as ARA and RNO-G target the radio emission induced by these particles as they cascade in the ice, using deep in-ice antennas at the South Pole or in Greenland. In this context, it is essential to first characterize the in-ice radio signature from cosmic-ray-induced particle showers, which constitute a primary background for neutrino detection, and represent the fist in-situ detection of in-ice particle cascades with radio antennas. This characterization will help validate the detection principle and assist in calibration. To achieve this goal, we used FAERIE, the "Framework for the simulation of Air shower Emission of Radio for in-Ice Experiments", that combines CoREAS and GEANT4 to simulate the radio emission of cosmic ray showers deep in the ice. Using this tool, we analyze in-ice radio signatures of cosmic-ray showers, including polarization, timing, and radiation energy, as well as their dependence on shower parameters. These insights will facilitate the first cosmic-ray detections and improve cosmic-ray/neutrino discrimination.</description>

      <title>In-ice Radio Signatures of Cosmic Ray Particle Cascades</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as the Askaryan Radio Array and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland target the radio emission induced by these particles as they cascade in the ice, using deep in-ice antennas at the South Pole or in Greenland. A crucial step toward this goal is the characterization of the in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray-induced particle showers. These showers form a primary background for neutrino searches, but can also be used to validate the detection principle and provide calibration signals for in-ice radio detectors. In this work, we use the Monte-Carlo framework FAERIE to perform the first characterization of cosmic ray signals with simulations that incorporate both their in-air and in-ice emissions. We investigate cosmic ray signatures such as their radiation energy, timing, polarization and frequency spectrum and quantify how they depend on shower properties. These results provide key guidelines for cosmic-ray identification and cosmic-ray neutrino discrimination in future in-ice radio experiments.</description>

      <title>Radio Morphing: Fast computation of inclined air shower radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of next-generation large-scale radio experiments requires running a fast and efficient number of simulations to explore multiple detector configurations over vast areas and develop novel methods for the reconstruction of air shower parameters. While Monte Carlo simulations are accurate and reliable tools, they are too computationally expensive to explore the full parameter space of these new detectors within a reasonable timescale. We introduce a new version of Radio Morphing, a semi-analytical tool designed to simulate the radio emission of any cosmic-ray induced air shower with zenith angle $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, at any desired antenna position, from the simulation data of a few reference showers at given positions. We present the latest performances of Radio Morphing which now provides simulation of air shower radio signals with average relative differences on the peak amplitude below $17\%$ on raw traces, below $15\%$ with a $3\sigma$ trigger threshold, below $13\%$ in the $[50-200]\,\rm MHz$ band, and even below $\sim 10\%$ in the $[30-80]\,\rm MHz$ band. These results are combined with a computation time reduced by more than four orders of magnitude, compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Ruling Out Compact Jets as the Dominant Source of Radio Emission in Radio-quiet, High Eddington-ratio Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of core radio emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is still actively debated. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations often predict the launching of moderately large-scale jets from super-Eddington accretion flows, but this prediction seems at odds with observations indicating most high/super-Eddington AGNs appear radio quiet. Here, we use the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosities as a multiwavelength diagnostic to probe the origin of radio emission in a sample of 69 radio-quiet, high/super-Eddington AGNs with black-hole masses $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}-10^{9}~M_\odot$. With this wide dynamic range in $M_{\rm BH}$, we adapt existing formalisms for how jetted radio emission and accretion-powered X-ray emission scale with black hole mass into the super-Eddington regime. We find that the radio/X-ray luminosity ratios observed across this $M_{\rm BH}$ range are inconsistent with a jet-dominated model for radio emission. We discuss how our results may instead be consistent with a corona-dominated radio emission origin with a contribution from outflows at higher accretion rates.</description>

      <title>A binary merger product as the direct progenitor of a Type II-P supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II-P supernovae (SNe II-P) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe in the local Universe and play critical roles in many aspects of astrophysics. Since decades ago theorists have predicted that SNe II-P may originate not only from single stars but also from interacting binaries. While ~20 SNII-P progenitors have been directly detected on pre-explosion images, observational evidence still remains scarce for this speculated binary progenitor channel. In this work, we report the discovery of a red supergiant progenitor for the Type II-P SN 2018gj. While the progenitor resembles those of other SNe II-P in terms of effective temperature and luminosity, it is located in a very old environment and SN 2018gj has an abnormally short plateau in the light curve. With state-of-the-art binary evolution simulations, we find these characteristics can only be explained if the progenitor of SN 2018gj is the merger product of a close binary system, which developed a different interior structure and evolved over a longer timescale compared with single-star evolution. This work provides the first compelling evidence for the long-sought binary progenitor channel toward SNe II-P, and our methodology serves as an innovative and pragmatic tool to motivate further investigations into this previously hidden population of SNe II-P from binaries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic winds in resistive compact binary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf Novae and low-mass X-ray binaries are eruptive binary systems comprised of a Roche-lobe overflowing solar-type star and an accreting compact object. Their recurrence time can be explained by a low-accreting phase, the quiescence, during which the angular momentum transport parameter is inferred to be $\alpha \approx 0.01$ by the Disc Instability Model. Non-magnetics mechanisms, such as spiral wave transport, only achieve angular momentum transport an order of magnitude too low, at best, because these discs are so thin in quiescence. During this phase, the Magneto-rotational Instability is known to be suppressed by the increased resistivity of the weakly ionised plasma. Studying these thin magnetised discs is a numerical challenge because of the wide range of scales to be resolved. Thanks to the new GPU-accelerated code Idefix, we produce global 3D MHD simulations of a very thin disc $(H/R = 0.01)$ for the first time. We explore the possibility that an MHD wind arises and increases accretion in low magnetic Reynolds number $(\mathrm{Rm}\approx100)$ and realistic plasma parameter ($\beta \approx 1000$) regimes. We observe that the MRI is only quenched in the resistive disc bulk but survives in the disc atmosphere. This drives strong accretion and wind launching. We quantify the efficiency of the resulting wind and measure its global effect on the disc. We explore the effect of the initial disc magnetisation and compare the accretion/ejection regime with and without resistivity.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Poloidal Fields Embedded in Thin Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many accreting systems are modeled as geometrically thin disks. Simulations of accretion disks cannot be extended to this regime, although local models can address the behavior of narrow annuli. A global model needs to account for the interactions between a large-scale poloidal field, accreted from the environment, and the disk. The disk magnetosphere can be modeled subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the disk. These depend on the structure of the magnetic field as it crosses the disk and the degree to which the disk can support a bend in the field lines. Building on earlier work we derive a set of equations describing a stationary disk with an embedded poloidal field. We derive a modified induction equation that incorporates tensorial turbulent diffusivities and a helicity-regulated $\alpha$-effect. We quantify how helicity conservation introduces a nonlinear backreaction on the large-scale dynamo, dynamically coupling turbulent diffusion and $\alpha$-quenching. We discuss the challenges encountered in finding a unique solution under stationary flows $E_\phi =0$, which balances the inflow of $B_z$ due to accretion, the outflow due to radial diffusion of $B_z$, and the vertical movement of $B_r$ due to turbulent diffusion and buoyancy. The vertical profiles of both the azimuthal diffusion coefficient $D_{ijk}$ and the helicity-driven $\alpha_{ij}$ demonstrate that changes in the radial gradient can restructure the magnetic field geometry. The ability of disks to sustain large bending angles in the poloidal field implies that angular momentum flux through the magnetosphere can dominate over internal transport even for weak fields. Competing factors can result in non-unique solutions, necessitating extra constraints and diagnostics that highlight the role of isotropic turbulence and helicity regulation in magnetized disk environments.</description>

      <title>Does the radio-active phase of XTE~J1810$-$197 recur following the same evolutionary pattern?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are the most strongly magnetized compact objects known in the Universe and are regarded as one of the primary engines powering a variety of enigmatic, high-energy transients. However, our understanding of magnetars remains highly limited, constrained by observational sample size and radiative variability. XTE~J1810$-$197, which re-entered a radio-active phase in 2018, is one of only six known radio-pulsating magnetars. Leveraging the distinctive capability for simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we utilized the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT) to monitor this magnetar continuously at both 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, capturing its entire evolution from radio activation to quenching. This enabled precise characterization of the evolution in its integrated profile, spin frequency, flux density, and spectral index ($\alpha$, defined by $S \propto f^{\alpha}$). The first time derivative of its spin frequency $\dot{\nu}$ passed through four distinct phases -- rapid decrease, violent oscillation, steady decline, and stable recovery -- before returning to its pre-outburst value concomitant with the cessation of radio emission. Remarkably, both the amplitudes and the characteristic time-scales of these $\dot{\nu}$ variations match those observed during the previous outburst that began in 2003, providing the first demonstration that post-outburst rotational evolution and radiative behavior in a magnetar are repeatable. A twisted-magnetosphere model can qualitatively account for this repeatability as well as for the progressive narrowing and abrupt disappearance of the radio pulse radiation, thereby receiving strong observational support.</description>

      <title>What can be learnt from UHECR anisotropies observations Paper III: Update with new data and Galactic magnetic fields models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. At large angular scales, the Pierre Auger Observatory has reported a significant dipole modulation in right ascension, while at intermediate angular scales, localized flux excesses have been identified by both the Auger and Telescope Array collaborations. These observations were investigated in the first two papers of this series. Aims. We examine the implications of these anisotropy measurements and assess to what extent they can be used to constrain the origin of UHECRs and the astrophysical or physical parameters of viable source scenarios.
  Methods. As in the first two papers of this series, we generate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of astrophysical models consistent with current spectral and composition constraints, assuming that UHECR sources trace the distribution of galaxies in the Universe. We update our previous studies by incorporating the most recent models of the Galactic magnetic field and apply the same large- and intermediate-scale anisotropy analyses as those used by the Auger Collaboration to simulated datasets with current experimental exposure.
  Results. The main novelty of this third paper is the improved compatibility between simulations and data, in particular regarding the reconstructed dipole direction, when using several of the recently proposed Galactic magnetic field models. Despite this progress, our main conclusions remain unchanged: although the observed anisotropies are compatible with an extragalactic origin of UHECRs, present data and magnetic-field uncertainties do not allow strong constraints to be placed on the nature, spatial distribution, or density of UHECR sources.
  Conclusions. Further progress in the interpretation of UHECR anisotropies will require improved constraints on cosmic magnetic fields, advances in source modeling, and significantly larger experimental exposures</description>

Abstract: Changing-state active galactic nuclei (CSAGNs) exhibit rapid variability, with mass accretion rates that can change by several orders of magnitude in a few years. This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the inner accretion flow almost in real time. Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} = -2.47 \pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the Arches star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compact stellar clusters have emerged as particularly promising candidates for cosmic rays (CR) accelerators. The star clusters, recently observed in gamma-rays, are also known sources of non-thermal X-ray emission, which is due to synchrotron or inverse-Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. Thus, the search for the non-thermal X-ray emission from stellar clusters is of particular interest. Until recent time the X-ray emission of the Arches star cluster in the Galactic Center was mixed with non-thermal emission of the surrounding molecular cloud, associated with reflection of hard X-ray irradiation. This reflected emission has been observed to fade, giving us a chance to characterize intrinsic non-thermal emission of the Arches cluster. In this work we demonstrate that Fe K_alpha line emission at 6.4 keV, attributed to the reflected non-thermal emission of the molecular cloud in 2000-2010, is not detected in deep observations with XMM-Newton in 2020 and Chandra in 2022, leaving stellar cluster well isolated. We showed that the Arches non-thermal emission is localized in the cluster's core and characterized by a relatively weak, hard (Gamma~1.5) power-law spectral continuum with 2-10 keV flux of ~10E-13 ergs/s/cm^2.</description>

      <title>Temporal variability of polarization in blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal variability of polarization of synchrotron radiation from blazar jets. Multiwavelength observations revealed high-amplitude rotations of the electric vector position angle (EVPA), both in the optical and in the X-rays. More often, the polarization degree and the EVPA show a seemingly erratic variability. To interpret these observations, we present a geometric and deterministic model in which off-axis, compact emitting features (i.e.,~blobs) propagate along the jet with the local velocity of the flow. The dynamics of the blobs is determined by the jet electromagnetic fields, which are calculated self-consistently using an analytical model of magnetically dominated outflows. The jet is axisymmetric, and its electromagnetic fields do not have a turbulent component. We show that the observed polarization is sensitive to the initial spatial configurations of the blobs. For the same jet structure, we observe several remarkably complex polarization patterns, including large EVPA rotations of $180^{\circ}$ or more in both directions and more erratic fluctuations. Simultaneous high-amplitude variations of the polarization degree and the EVPA can coincide with peaks of the observed luminosity. However, seemingly uncorrelated variations are also possible. We discuss the feasibility of constraining the particle acceleration mechanism from multifrequency polarimetric observations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A revealed by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elemental abundances of the Fe-peak elements (such as Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni) and Ti are important for understanding the environment of explosive nuclear burning for the core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). In particular, the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is well known for its asymmetric structure, contains three ``Fe-rich blobs,'' and the composition of the Fe-peak elements within these structures could be related to the asymmetry of the supernova explosion. We report a highly asymmetric distribution of the Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A as revealed by XRISM observations. We found that the southeastern Fe-rich region has a significant Mn emission above the 4$\sigma$ confidence level, while the northwestern Fe-rich region has no clear signature. In addition to the significant difference in Mn abundance across these regions, our observations show that the Ti/Fe, Mn/Cr, and Ni/Fe ratios vary from region to region. The observed asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements could be produced by (1) the mixing of materials from different burning layers of the supernova, (2) the asymmetric distribution of the electron fraction in the progenitor star and/or (3) the local dependence of the neutrino irradiation in the supernova innermost region. Future spatially resolved spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A using X-ray microcalorimeters will enable more detailed measurements of the distribution and composition of these elements, providing a unique tool for testing asymmetric supernova physics.</description>

      <title>A Study of Two Type IIb Supernovae: SNe 2008aq and 2019gaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic studies of two core-collapse supernovae (SNe) 2008aq and 2019gaf in the optical wavelengths. Light curve and spectral sequence of both the SNe are similar to those of other Type IIb SNe. The pre-maximum spectrum of SN~2008aq showed prominent H $\alpha$ lines, the He lines started appearing in the near maximum spectrum. The near maximum spectrum of SN~2019gaf shows shallow H$\alpha$ absorption and He lines with almost similar strength. Both the SNe show transition from hydrogen-dominated spectra to helium-dominated spectra within a month after maximum brightness. The velocity evolution of SN~2008aq matches well with those of other well-studied Type IIb SNe, while SN~2019gaf shows higher velocities. Close to maximum light, the H $\alpha$ and He I line velocities of SN~2019gaf are $\sim$ 2000 km sec$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 4000 km sec$^{-1}$ higher than other well-studied Type IIb SNe. Semi-analytical modeling indicates SN~2019gaf to be a more energetic explosion with a smaller ejecta mass than SN~2008aq. The zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor estimated using the nebular spectra of SN~2008aq ranges between 13 to 20 M$_\odot$, while for SN~2019gaf, the inferred ZAMS mass is between 13 to 25 M$_\odot$. The [O I] to [Ca II] lines flux ratio favors a less massive progenitor star in a binary system for both the SNe.</description>

      <title>The combined X-ray and $\gamma$-ray modeling of millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451 in the dissipative magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of the NICER X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451 provides a strong evidence for the existence of non-dipole magnetic fields. We study the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission of PSR J0030+0451 in the dissipative dipole plus off-centred quadrupole magnetospheres. The dissipative FF+AE dipole magnetospheres by combining force-free (FF) and Aristotelian electrodynamics (AE) are solved by a 3D pseudo-spectral method in the rotating coordinate system. We use the FF+AE dipole plus off-centred quadrupole fields with minimum free parameters to reproduce two hotspot configurations found by the NICER observations. The X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission from PSR J0030+0451 are simultaneously computed by using a ray-tracing method and a particle trajectory method. The modelled X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission is then directly compared with those of PSR J0030+0451 from the NICER and Fermi observations. Our results can well reproduce the observed trends of the NICER X-ray and Fermi $\gamma$-ray emission for PSR J0030+0451.</description>

      <title>High-resolution simulations of non-thermal emission from LS 5039</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous study, we investigated the relativistic wind dynamics in the LS 5039 system. In this work, we analyse energetic-particle transport within this modelling context, where we simulate the high-energy particle distribution and ensuing emission of non-thermal radiation. From these high-resolution simulations, we compute the non-thermal emission from this system and compare it to corresponding observations. We modelled the LS 5039 system assuming a wind-driven scenario. Our numerical model uses a joint simulation of the dynamical wind interaction together with the transport of energetic leptons from the shocked pulsar wind. We computed the non-thermal emission from this system in a post-processing step from the resulting distribution of energetic leptons. In this computation, we took into account the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, relativistic beaming, and {\gamma}{\gamma}-absorption in the stellar radiation field. We investigated the dynamical variation of the energetic particle spectra on both orbital and on short timescales. Our model successfully reproduces many of the spectral features of LS 5039. We also find a better correspondence between our predicted orbital light curves and the corresponding observations in soft x-rays, low-energy, and high-energy gamma rays than in our previous modelling efforts. We find that our high-resolution and large-scale simulations can successfully capture the relevant parts of the wind-collision region that are related to particle acceleration and emission of non-thermal radiation. The quality of the fit strengthens the wind-driven assumption underlying our model. Desirable extensions for the future include a dynamical magnetic-field model for the synchrotron regime, a revision of our injection parameters, and a consideration of an additional hadronic component that could explain recent observations in the 100~TeV regime.</description>

      <title>Revealing the diversity of Type IIn supernova progenitors through their environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are hydrogen-rich explosions embedded in dense circumstellar medium (CSM), which gives rise to their characteristic narrow hydrogen emission lines. The nature of their progenitors and pre-explosion mass loss remains, however, poorly understood. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we analyze the local stellar environments of a volume-limited sample (z &lt; 0.02) of 31 SNe IIn. The environments of SNe IIn are found to be very diverse; the SN could reside within a star-forming region (Class 1), outside a star-forming region (Class 2), or in much older environments without any obvious signs of star formation (Class 3). The bright SNe IIn (Mpeak &lt; -19.5 mag) predominantly occur in Class 1 environments, indicative of very massive progenitors, while the faint SNe IIn (Mpeak &lt; -15.5 mag) are associated with Classes 2 and 3 environments, suggesting the least massive progenitors. Meanwhile, normal SNe IIn with -19.5 &lt; Mpeak &lt; -15.5 mag occur in all three types of environments, suggesting a diversity in their progenitor mass, lifetime, and evolutionary pathways. Moreover, the directly detected SN IIn progenitors are systematically brighter and/or bluer than the youngest stellar populations in their environments, suggesting that they were either in a non-quiescent state when observed or had experienced binary interactions. These results point to a significantly diverse origin for progenitors of SNe IIn, spanning a wide range of masses, evolutionary stages, and potential binary interaction histories.</description>

      <title>Uniform models of neutron and quark (strange) stars in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of neutron and strange stars are considered in the approximation of a uniform density distribution. A universal algebraic equation, valid for any equation of state, is used to find the approximate mass of a star of a given density without resorting to the integration of differential equations. Equations of state for neutron stars had been taken for degenerate neutron gas and for more realistic ones, used by Bethe, Malone, Johnson (1975). Models of homogeneous strange stars for the equation of state in the "quark bag model" have a simple analytical solution. The solutions presented in the paper for various equations of state differ from the exact solutions obtained by the numerical integration of differential equations by at most $ \sim 20 \%$.
  The formation of strange stars is examined as a function of the deconfinement boundary (DB), at which quarks become deconfined. Existing experimental data indicate that matter reaches very high densities in the vicinity of the DB. This imposes strong constraints on the maximum mass of strange stars and prohibits their formation at the final stages of stellar evolution, because the limiting mass of neutron stars is substantially higher and corresponds to considerably lower matter densities.</description>

      <title>Cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrinos from discrete black hole X-ray binary ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of cosmic rays from outside the Solar system are unknown, as they are deflected by the interstellar magnetic field. Supernova remnants are the main candidate for cosmic rays up to PeV energies but due to lack of evidence, they cannot be concluded as the sources of the most energetic Galactic CRs. We investigate discrete ejecta produced in state transitions of black hole X-ray binary systems as a potential source of cosmic rays, motivated by recent $&gt;100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray detections by LHAASO. Starting from MAXI J1820+070, we examine the multi-wavelength observations and find that efficient particle acceleration may take place (i.e. into a robust power-law), up to $\sim2\times 10^{16}\mu^{-1/2}$ eV, where $\mu$ is the ratio of particle energy to magnetic energy. From these calculations, we estimate the global contribution of ejecta to the entire Galactic spectrum to be $\sim1\%$, with the cosmic ray contribution rising to $\sim5\%$ at PeV energies, assuming roughly equal energy in non-thermal protons, non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields. In addition, we calculate associated $\gamma$-ray and neutrino spectra of the MAXI J1820+070 ejecta to investigate new detection methods with CTAO, which provide strong constraints on initial ejecta size of order $10^7$ Schwarzschild radii ($10^{-5}$ pc) assuming a period of adiabatic expansion.</description>

      <title>Timing Gamma-ray Pulsars using Gibbs Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timing analyses of gamma-ray pulsars in the Fermi Large Area Telescope data set can provide sensitive probes of many astrophysical processes, including timing noise in young pulsars, orbital period variations in redback binaries, and the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). These goals can require careful accounting of stochastic noise processes, but existing methods developed to achieve this in radio pulsar timing analyses cannot be immediately applied to the discrete gamma-ray arrival time data. To address this, we have developed a new method for timing gamma-ray pulsars, in which the timing model fit is transformed into a weighted least squares problem by randomly assigning each photon to an individual Gaussian component of a template pulse profile. These random assignments are then numerically marginalised over through a Gibbs sampling scheme. This method allows for efficient estimation of timing and noise model parameters, while taking into account uncertainties in the pulse profile shape. We simulated Fermi-LAT data sets for gamma-ray pulsars with power-law timing noise processes, showing that this method provides robust estimates of timing noise parameters. We also describe a Gaussian-process model for orbital period variations in black-widow and redback binary systems that can be fit using this new timing method. We demonstrate this method on the black-widow binary millisecond pulsar B1957+20, where the orbital period varies significantly over the LAT data, but which provides one of the most stringent gamma-ray upper limits on the GWB.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (&gt; $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).</description>

      <title>A Unified Charge-Dependent Modulation Model for AMS-02 Proton and Antiproton Fluxes during Solar Minimum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified charge-dependent solar modulation model by solving the three-dimensional Parker transport equation, incorporating a realistic wavy heliospheric current sheet to treat drift effects self-consistently. Using a local interstellar spectrum from GALPROP constrained by Voyager data, we fit the model to time-resolved proton and antiproton fluxes measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 (AMS-02) during the solar-quiet period (May 2011 to June 2022). To enable rapid parameter scans, we employ neural-network-based surrogate models to compute propagation and modulation matrices efficiently. The results demonstrate that the model simultaneously describes the observed proton and antiproton fluxes with physically reasonable parameters, providing a unified account of charge-dependent modulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07688</link>

Abstract: Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</description>

      <title>A COLIBRI Photometric Study of SN 2025bvm: A Normal, Slowly Declining Type Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 121 days of multi-band (\Bband, \gband, \rband, \iband) optical photometry of the Type Ia supernova SN 2025bvm, obtained with the COLIBRI telescope at OAN-SPM. The light curves show a photometric decline of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 0.867 \pm 0.051$~mag, characteristic of a slow-declining Type Ia supernova. After correcting for host galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)_{host} = 0.308 \pm 0.030$~mag) and adopting a distance of 70~Mpc, we derive a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -19.13 \pm 0.40$~mag. This luminosity is fully consistent with its slow decline rate, placing SN 2025bvm within the population of normal Type Ia supernovae. We conclude that SN 2025bvm is a normal Type Ia supernova, whose photometric properties, such as a slow late-time decline and a prominent \iband-band secondary maximum, suggest an explosion that resulted in a particularly massive ejecta.</description>

      <title>Formation of massive multiple-star systems: early migration and mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are often found in multiple systems, yet how binary-star systems with very close separations ($\lesssim$ au) assemble remains unresolved. We investigate the formation and inward migration of massive-star binaries in Solar-metallicity environments using the star-cluster formation simulation of Chon et al. (2024), which forms a $1200\,M_\odot$ stellar cluster and resolves binaries down to 1 au separation. Our results indicate that stars more massive than $2\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly assemble in binary or triple configurations, in agreement with observations, with member stars forming nearly coevally. In most of these systems, the inner binary hardens by one to three orders of magnitude and reaches a steady-state within the first $0.1\,$Myr. Notably, all binaries whose final separations are below 10 au are hardened with the aid of circumbinary discs, highlighting disc-driven migration as a key to produce tight massive binaries. We further find that binaries form with random inclinations relative to the initial rotation axis of the cloud, and that mutual inclinations in triple systems follow an isotropic distribution, implying that stochastic interactions driven by turbulence and few-body dynamics are crucial during assembly and migration. Finally, stars with $M&gt;2\,M_{\odot}$ often undergo repeated merger events during cluster evolution, yielding extreme mass ratios ($q&lt;0.1$). Some of these products may evolve into compact-object binaries containing a black hole or neutron star, including X-ray binaries and systems detectable by Gaia.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature: horizon structure and extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature (i.e. constant scalar curvature) admits rotating and charged black hole solutions obtained from the Kerr-Newman-(A)dS metrics of general relativity through appropriate rescalings of the metric parameters. In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.</description>

      <title>Limits of vacuum-template subtraction for LISA massive black hole binary sources in realistic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) dephasing due to gas accretion on the subtraction of massive black hole (MBH) binary signals over 4 yr of LISA data in the context of the global-fit. Based on state of the art predictions for the population of merging MBHs, we show that imperfect subtraction with vacuum waveform templates leaves a GW residual with an SNR of $3.2^{+5.4}_{-1.9}\times \sqrt{f_{\rm Edd} \langle \dot n \rangle/(20\, {\rm yr}^{-1})}$, where $f_{\rm Edd}$ is the typical Eddington ratio and $\langle \dot n \rangle$ the mean merger rate of LISA MBH binaries. We characterize the dependence of the residual on key population hyper-parameters, provide a simple fitting function and discuss detection and mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>IndIGO-D: Probing Compact Binary Coalescences in the Decihertz GW Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study IndIGO-D, a decihertz gravitational-wave mission concept, focusing on a specific configuration in which three spacecraft fly in formation to form an L-shaped interferometer in a heliocentric orbit. The two orthogonal arms share a common vertex, providing a space-based analogue of terrestrial Michelson detectors, while operating in an optimised configuration that yields ppm-level arm-length stability. Assuming 1000 km arm length, we analyse the orbital motion and antenna response, and assess sensitivity across the [0.1 - 10] Hz band bridging LISA and next-generation ground-based interferometers. Using fiducial sensitivity curves provided by the IndIGO-D collaboration, we compute horizon distances for different source classes. Intermediate-mass black-hole binaries with masses $10^{2}$ - $10^{3} \, M_\odot$ are detectable to redshifts $z \sim 10^{3}$, complementing the reach of LISA and terrestrial detectors. Binary neutron star systems are observable to a horizon distance of $z \lesssim 0.3$, allowing continuous multi-band coverage with Voyager-class interferometers from the decihertz regime to merger. A Bayesian parameter-estimation study of a GW170817-like binary shows that the sky localization area improves from $\sim 21 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ at one month to $0.3 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ at six hours pre-merger! These sky areas are readily tiled by wide-field time-domain telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory, whose $9.6 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of view and r-band depth enable high-cadence, repeated coverage of GW170817-like kilonovae at this distance and beyond. IndIGO-D exploits the rapid evolution of binaries in the decihertz band to bridge the gap between millihertz and terrestrial observations, enabling early warnings on timescales from months to hours and enhancing the prospects for multi-band and multi-messenger discoveries.</description>

      <title>Chiroptical effect induced by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rates on Calcium Production in Population III Stars: A Global Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of calcium production to nuclear reaction rates of a 40 solar-mass Population III star using 1D multi-zone stellar models. A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars.
  Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio.</description>

      <title>Rotation-dependent $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ relations in perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called $I$-Love-$Q$ relations link some normalized versions of the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the quadrupole moment of a star. These relations, in principle, enable the inference of two of the quantities given the third. However, their use has been limited because the normalized versions of the multipole moments rely on the static mass derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which is not directly observable. In this work, using perturbation theory, we find that the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations can also be formulated in terms of an alternative set of normalized quantities that do not depend on the static mass, but on the actual (observable) mass.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lorentz Invariance Violation from Ultra-high-energy Gamma Rays Observed by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.12350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the LHAASO Collaboration published the detection of 12 ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources above 100 TeV, with the highest energy photon reaching 1.4 PeV. The first detection of PeV gamma rays from astrophysical sources may provide a very sensitive probe of the effect of the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which results in decay of high-energy gamma rays in the superluminal scenario and hence a sharp cutoff of the energy spectrum. Two highest energy sources are studied in this work. No signature of the existence of LIV is found in their energy spectra, and the lower limits on the LIV energy scale are derived. Our results show that the first-order LIV energy scale should be higher than about 10^5 times the Planck scale M_{pl} and that the second-order LIV scale is &gt;10^{-3}M_{pl}. Both limits improve by at least one order of magnitude the previous results.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent 3D radiative transfer for kilonovae: directional spectra from merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17612v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations for the ejecta from a neutron star merger that include line-by-line opacities for tens of millions of bound-bound transitions, composition from an r-process nuclear network, and time-dependent thermalization of decay products from individual $\alpha$ and $\beta^-$ decay reactions. In contrast to expansion opacities and other wavelength-binned treatments, a line-by-line treatment enables us include fluorescence effects and associate spectral features with the emitting and absorbing lines of individual elements. We find variations in the synthetic observables with both the polar and azimuthal viewing angles. The spectra exhibit blended features with strong interactions by Ce III, Sr II, Y II, and Zr II that vary with time and viewing direction. We demonstrate the importance of wavelength-calibration of atomic data using a model with calibrated Sr, Y, and Zr data, and find major differences in the resulting spectra, including a better agreement with AT2017gfo. The synthetic spectra for near-polar inclination show a feature at around 8000 A, similar to AT2017gfo. However, they evolve on a more rapid timescale, likely due to the low ejecta mass (0.005 M$_\odot$) as we take into account only the early ejecta. The comparatively featureless spectra for equatorial observers gives a tentative prediction that future observations of edge-on kilonovae will appear substantially different from AT2017gfo. We also show that 1D models obtained by spherically averaging the 3D ejecta lead to dramatically different direction-integrated luminosities and spectra compared to full 3D calculations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian constraints on quark stars from multi-messenger observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic Bayesian analysis of quark star equations of state under current multimessenger constraints, investigating the impact of prior assumptions and extreme-mass observations. Quark matter is modeled within an interacting MIT bag framework that consistently accommodates color-superconducting phases (2SC, 2SC+s, and CFL) and perturbative QCD corrections. We find that quark star models exhibit a distinct advantage in naturally accommodating the ultra-low mass object HESS J1731-347, a configuration that is challenging for standard neutron star models. In the high-mass regime, the interpretation of the secondary component of GW190814 is shown to be strongly prior-dependent: only broad priors allow for the substantial stiffness required to support such a massive object ($\sim$2.6 M$_\odot$), while more restrictive priors favor a softer equation of state consistent with standard pulsar populations. Microscopically, we demonstrate that current data tightly constrain the effective bag constant and the overall stiffness, but cannot distinguish between different color-superconducting phases. Furthermore, we validate a reduction of the model to two effective parameters without loss of information. Our results indicate that if quark stars exist, their sound speeds consistently exceeds the conformal limit ($c_s^2&gt;1/3$) at stellar densities.</description>

      <title>What determines the $\gamma$-ray luminosities of classical novae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical novae in the Milky Way have now been well-established as high-energy GeV $\gamma$-ray sources. In novae with main-sequence companions, this emission is believed to result from shocks internal to the nova ejecta, as a later fast wind collides with an earlier slow outflow. To test this model and constrain the $\gamma$-ray production mechanism, we present a systematic study of a sample of recent Galactic novae, comparing their $\gamma$-ray properties ($\gamma$-ray luminosity and duration) with their outflow velocities, peak $V$-band magnitudes, and the decline times of their optical light curves ($t_2$). We uniformly estimate distances in a luminosity-independent manner, using spectroscopic reddening estimates combined with three-dimensional Galactic dust maps. Across our sample, $\gamma$-ray luminosities ($&gt;$100 MeV) vary by three orders of magnitude, spanning $10^{34}-10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Novae with larger velocity of the fast outflow (or larger differential between the fast and slow outflow) have larger $\gamma$-ray luminosities, but are detectable for a shorter duration. The optical and $\gamma$-ray fluxes are correlated, consistent with substantial thermal emission in the optical from shock-heated gas. Across six novae with $\gamma$-ray and infrared light curves, evidence for dust formation appears soon after the end of the detected $\gamma$-ray emission. Dusty and non-dusty novae appear to have similar $\gamma$-ray luminosities, though novae that have more material processed by the shocks may be more likely to form dust. We find that the properties of the $\gamma$-ray emission in novae depend heavily on the ejecta properties, and are consistent with expectations for internal shocks.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Jipole}$: A Differentiable $\texttt{ipole}$-based Code for Radiative Transfer in Curved Spacetimes</title>

Abstract: Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.</description>

      <title>New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>Born to be recycled: a comprehensive population synthesis of the Galactic millisecond pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date. In the 1980s, to explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated: the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys. Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model, respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that there should be less than $220$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle $\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10${\deg}). We find that only a small fraction, approximately $\sim 7.6\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.</description>

      <title>Implications of Joint Spectral Analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on Phenomenological Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis, focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period 2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar Wind-Blown Bubbles as Environments for Late-Time Rebrightening of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow rebrightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.401$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe.We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that is characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of the progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by EP and SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveal information about progenitors and their circum-environments.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe Discovery of an X-ray Flare from K-type Star PM J23221-0301</title>

Abstract: Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation. This discovery underscores EP's capability in understanding stellar magnetic activity via observing stellar transients.</description>

      <title>Multiband Gravitational Wave Detection Prospects for M31 UCXB-1 System in Low and Middle Frequency Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho&gt;8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 &gt; 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho &gt; 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a semi-classical phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom leading to the black hole entropy in terms of a Bose Einstein (BEC) condensate of gravitons, we study how to introduce logarithmic corrections. In fact we show that, after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales, a logarithmic term does appear in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law. We also obtain that the entropy $S_{BH}$ of a ball of Planckian areal radius is $2\pi K_B$, i.e. $S_{BH}(R=L_P)=2\pi K_B$. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a BEC of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.</description>

      <title>Supernova constraints on lepton flavor violating ALPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernovae offer a unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We investigate supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to electrons and muons. For LFV-ALP production in supernovae, muon decay and lepton bremsstrahlung have been considered previously. In this work, we identify the electron-muon coalescence channel as an efficient new production mechanism in the high-mass regime. We also include the semi-Compton scattering process, which has recently been shown to provide sizable contributions for electron-coupled ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime, electron-muon coalescence becomes the leading channel at high masses, and semi-Compton scattering provides the dominant contribution in the intermediate mass range. We find that the electron-muon coalescence process yields the strongest constraints in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV, probing the ALP-electron-muon coupling down to $\sim 4\times 10^{-10}$ for an ALP mass of $\sim200$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gravitational-wave detection: a machine learning pipeline combination approach with robust uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals. Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3, enhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold binary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in X-rays: Revised XMM-Newton Limits and New Constraints from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Diffuse astrophysical neutrinos from dark matter around blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos from blazars can originate from inelastic scatterings between protons within their jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around them, explaining IceCube detections of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 that are otherwise challenging for models of its jet. In this paper we calculate such DM-induced high-energy neutrinos, from TXS 0506+056 as well as from a stacked blazar sample, in the four cases where DM-quark interactions are mediated by a new massive vector, axial, scalar, and pseudoscalar particle. Intriguingly, we find that this mechanism can saturate the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube at high energies. Our mechanism will be tested by additional blazar observations and by various searches for sub-GeV DM.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Color-superconducting quarkyonic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&amp;K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.</description>

      <title>SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) offer advantages over traditional neural networks for astronomical data processing, in regimes with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise and limited labeled samples. Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>
