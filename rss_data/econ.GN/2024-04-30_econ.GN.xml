      <title>Analysis of Proximity Informed User Behavior in a Global Online Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the earlier claim of "Death of Distance", recent studies revealed that geographical proximity still greatly influences link formation in online social networks. However, it is unclear how physical distances are intertwined with users' online behaviors in a virtual world. We study the role of spatial dependence on a global online social network with a dyadic Logit model. Results show country-specific patterns for distance effect on probabilities to build connections. Effects are stronger when the possibility for two people to meet in person exists. Relative to weak ties, dependence on proximity is looser for strong social ties.</description>

      <title>The Impact of COVID-19 on Co-authorship and Economics Scholars' Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, prompting a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and coauthorship dynamics on research output. Using a novel dataset, this paper endeavors to make a first cut at investigating the role of peer effects on the productivity of economics scholars, measured by the number of publications, in both pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Results show that peer effect is significant for the pre-pandemic time but not for the pandemic time. The findings contribute to our understanding of how research collaboration influences knowledge production and may help guide policies aimed at fostering collaboration and enhancing research productivity in the academic community.</description>

      <title>Internal migration after a uniform minimum wage introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal migration is an essential aspect to study labor mobility. I exploit the German statutory minimum wage introduction in 2015 to estimate its push and pull effects on internal migration using a 2% sample of administrative data. In a conditional fixed effects Poisson difference-in-differences framework with a continuous treatment, I find that the minimum wage introduction leads to an increase in the out-migration of low-skilled workers with migrant background by 25% with an increasing tendency over time from districts where a high share of workers are subject to the minimum wage (high-bite districts). In contrast the migration decision of native-born low-skilled workers is not affected by the policy. However, both native-born low-skilled workers and those with a migrant background do relocate across establishments, leaving high-bite districts as their workplace. In addition, I find an increase for unemployed individuals with a migrant background in out-migrating from high-bite districts. These results emphasize the importance of considering the effects on geographical labor mobility when implementing and analyzing policies that affect the determinants of internal migration.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Usage and Academic Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the impact of students' usage of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT on their academic performance. We analyze student essays using GenAI detection systems to identify GenAI users among the cohort. Employing multivariate regression analysis, we find that students using GenAI tools score on average 6.71 (out of 100) points lower than non-users. While GenAI tools may offer benefits for learning and engagement, the way students actually use it correlates with diminished academic outcomes. Exploring the underlying mechanism, additional analyses show that the effect is particularly detrimental to students with high learning potential, suggesting an effect whereby GenAI tool usage hinders learning. Our findings provide important empirical evidence for the ongoing debate on the integration of GenAI in higher education and underscores the necessity for educators, institutions, and policymakers to carefully consider its implications for student performance.</description>

      <title>Transforming Credit Guarantee Schemes with Distributed Ledger Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGSs) are crucial in mitigating SMEs' financial constraints. However, they are renownedly affected by critical shortcomings, such as a lack of financial sustainability and operational efficiency. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have shown significant revolutionary influence in several sectors, including finance and banking, thanks to the full operational traceability they bring alongside verifiable computation. Nevertheless, the potential synergy between DLTs and CGSs has not been thoroughly investigated yet. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to utilise DLTs, particularly blockchain technologies, in CGS processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we compare key architectural characteristics considering access level, governance structure, and consensus method, to examine their fit with CGS processes. We believe this study can guide policymakers and stakeholders, thereby stimulating further innovation in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Global Shipyard Capacities Limiting the Ramp-Up of Global Hydrogen Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonizing the global energy system requires significant expansions of renewable energy technologies. Given that cost-effective renewable sources are not necessarily situated in proximity to the largest energy demand centers globally, the maritime transportation of low-carbon energy carriers, such as renewable-based hydrogen or ammonia, will be needed. However, whether existent shipyards possess the required capacity to provide the necessary global fleet has not yet been answered. Therefore, this study estimates global tanker demand based on projections for global hydrogen demand, while comparing these projections with historic shipyard production. Our findings reveal a potential bottleneck until 2033-2039 if relying on liquefied hydrogen exclusively. This bottleneck could be circumvented by increasing local hydrogen production, utilizing pipelines, or liquefied ammonia as an energy carrier for hydrogen. Furthermore, the regional concentration of shipyard locations raises concerns about diversification. Increasing demand for container vessels could substantially hinder the scale-up of maritime hydrogen transport.</description>

      <title>Finding Stable Price Zones in European Electricity Markets: Aiming to Square the Circle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European day-ahead electricity market is split into multiple bidding zones with a uniform price. The increase in renewables leads to a growing number of interventions in the generation of energy sources and increasing redispatch costs. To ensure efficient congestion management, the EU Commission mandated a Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. An integral part of this process was a locational marginal pricing study. Based on this study, alternative bidding zone configurations were proposed. These bidding zones shall be stable and robust over time. For Germany, four configurations were suggested. We analyzed the proposed configurations considering different clustering algorithms and periods based on the publicly released data set. We found that the configurations do not reduce the price standard deviations within zones much, and the average prices across zones are similar. Other configurations identified based on clustering the prices lead to lower price variance but they are not geographically coherent. Independent of the clustering features and algorithms used, the resulting clusters are not stable over time. While the costs of a bidding zone split in Germany are high, the effect on prices would be low based on an analysis of the new BZR data.</description>
