      <title>Stable soliton dark matter wormhole in non-minimally coupled $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry can indeed help in constructing stable, traversable, wormholes (WHs) without requiring exotic matter under certain conditions. In models like $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})={\cal Q}+\beta {\cal T}$ gravity, where ${\cal Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar, and ${\cal T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the coupling between matter and geometry introduces additional degrees of freedom in terms of the parameter $\beta$. These can mimic the effects of exotic matter or even replace it entirely under specific parameter choice. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on two dark matter (DM) density profiles: a solitonic core at the center of DM halos, and the outer halo follows the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile of cold DM (CDM). The wormhole solutions derived in these models satisfy important geometric conditions like: Flaring-out condition (necessary for traversability) and asymptotic flatness condition. For large positive coupling parameter, the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied at the wormhole throat, meaning exotic matter is not needed, while the wormhole is no longer Lorentzian and the flaring-out condition is broken. However, for large negative coupling parameter, the NEC can be satisfied, allowing for healthy wormholes without exotic matter, provided the coupling strength remains within certain bounds. In the latter case, the NEC is broken only effectively. We investigate the stability of the obtained wormhole solutions by virtue of a modified version of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which includes a new force due to matter-geometry non-minimal, showing that these wormholes can be dynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous ghostification: how a dying black hole comes back as a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum ghost that destabilizes the Schwarzschild solution, transforming it into a naked singularity, may seem like a physicist's worst nightmare. However, we argue that this scenario represents the natural evolution of a black hole within a conservative high-energy gravity framework and may, in fact, be a desirable outcome. Quadratic curvature terms typically appear as corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies; nonetheless, such theories are generally considered incomplete due to the presence of ghost particles at the quantum level, which can spoil vacuum stability. We argue that this instability can only be triggered at the final stages of black hole evaporation, starting a phase transition-like process that alters the nature of the spacetime, similarly to spontaneous scalarization. We propose that the endpoint is a stable, exotic naked singularity, possible only in modified gravity theories, and avoids some of the pathological features associated with standard naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole scalarization with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant can evade no-hair theorems and allow for non-trivial scalar profiles around black holes. This coupling is characterized by a length scale $\lambda$, which, in an effective field theory perspective, sets the threshold below which deviations from General Relativity become significant. LIGO/VIRGO constraints indicate $\lambda$ is small, implying supermassive black holes should not scalarize. However, recent work suggests that scalarization can occur within a narrow window of masses, allowing supermassive black holes to scalarize, while leaving LIGO/VIRGO sources unaffected. We explore the impact of this scenario on the stochastic gravitational wave background recently observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We find that scalarization can alter the characteristic strain produced by circularly inspiralling SMBH binaries and that current data shows a marginal preference for a non-zero $\lambda$. However, similar signatures could arise from astrophysical effects such as orbital eccentricity or environmental interactions, emphasizing the need for improved modeling and longer observations to discriminate among the different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic duality anomaly in accelerating waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical symmetry of the source-free Maxwell equations under electric-magnetic duality rotations leads to a conserved Noether charge, corresponding to the circular polarization of light. We show that, in quantum field theory, the vacuum expectation value of this charge is no longer time-independent inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. Specifically, photon pairs are spontaneously excited from the quantum vacuum by the accelerated background, while the helical motion induces an imbalance in the number of right- and left-handed modes produced. This photon helicity non-conservation reflects a genuine quantum effect that breaks the classical duality symmetry. The model considered paves the way for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem for linearized gravity in a cavity with conformal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lorentzian General Relativity in a cavity with a timelike boundary, with conformal boundary conditions and also a generalization of these boundary conditions. We focus on the linearized gravitational dynamics about the static empty cavity whose boundary has spherical spatial geometry. It has been recently shown that there exist dynamical instabilities, whose angular dependence is given in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}$, and whose coefficient of exponential growth in time goes as $\sim \ell^{1/3}$. We use these modes to construct a sequence of solutions for which the initial data converge to zero as $\ell \rightarrow \infty$ but for which the solution itself does not converge to zero. This implies a lack of continuity of solutions on initial data, which shows that the initial value problem with these boundary conditions is not well-posed. This is in tension with recent mathematical work on well-posedness for such boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Structural Properties of Anisotropic Dark Matter-Admixed Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic compact stars comprising two non-interacting fluids: quark matter and condensed dark matter. Using the MIT Bag model equation of state for quark matter and Bose-Einstein Condensate equation of state for dark matter, we numerically compute interior solutions for those two-fluid component spherical configurations. Varying the initial central density ratio of dark matter to quark matter, we examine how different proportions of these components influence the mass-radius profile, the factor of compactness as well as the quark mass fraction. Recent studies suggest that quark matter may exist in the cores of massive neutron stars, significantly affecting their structure and stability. We calculate the factor of compactness for both negative and positive anisotropy cases explored in this article. Our findings demonstrate that dark matter-admixed quark stars are more compact yet less massive compared to pure quark matter stars, aligning with recent theoretical predictions and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>Violation of weak cosmic censorship by the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture can be violated using the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model with a perfect fluid star interior. Metric models with a naked singularity can be used, and the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse might be possible; the null energy condition is also satisfied in these models. However, this is just a toy model because no known model as a solution to the Einstein equation. To avoid this problem, we can consider a naked singularity solution as a proper solution of the Einstein equation, but in this case, we need to introduce a thin-shell on top of the perfect fluid star. In this case, gravitational collapse is allowed, but the null energy condition should be violated at the thin-shell. In conclusion, we could not find a physically viable model that violates weak cosmic censorship, but it opens a window to study the properties of cosmic censorship constructively. The violation of weak cosmic censorship might be possible if a modified gravity model provides a solution that allows the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse without a shell. Also, regarding the thin-shell case, the shell approaches the naked singularity closer without violating the null energy condition, although it must violate the null energy condition at the singularity eventually; this might be regarded as an effective violation of cosmic censorship in some sense.</description>

      <title>Characteristic precessions of spherical orbit around a rotating braneworld black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital dynamics and relativistic precession effects in the spacetime of rotating braneworld black holes within the Randall-Sundrum framework. For test particles on spherical orbits, we analyze three conserved quantities-energy, angular momentum, and Carter constant-and examine how the innermost stable spherical orbit depends on the tidal charge and orbital inclination. Compared to Kerr black holes, braneworld corrections significantly modify both nodal and periastron precession frequencies: positive tidal charges suppress precession rates, while negative charges enhance them. For stationary gyroscopes, we calculate the Lense-Thirring precession frequency and demonstrate its sensitivity to the tidal charge, black hole spin, and gyroscope orientation. Our results show that a positive tidal charge weakens frame-dragging effects even as it enhances gravitational attraction-offering a distinctive signature of extra-dimensional gravity. These results have important implications for astrophysical observations, including accretion disk behavior, stellar orbital dynamics, and gravitational wave detection. The modified orbital and gyroscopic precession provide new ways to test braneworld gravity in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations to naked singularities of perfect fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the instability of naked singularities arising in the Einstein equations coupled with isothermal perfect fluid. We show that the spherically symmetric self-similar naked singularities of this system, are unstable to trapped surface formation, under $C^{1,\alpha}$ perturbations of an external massless scalar field. We viewed this as a toy model in studying the instability of these naked singularities under gravitational perturbations in the original Einstein--Euler system which is non-spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Probing Thermodynamic Phase Transitions of 4D R-Charged Black Holes via Lyapunov Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic phase structure of four-dimensional \textit{R}-charged black holes--characterized by four independent $U(1)$ charges--through the lens of Lyapunov exponents associated with unstable circular orbits of both massless and massive particles. Considering three distinct charge configurations (equal, partially unequal, and fully unequal), we show that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent can effectively probe the black hole phase transitions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the discontinuous jump in the Lyapunov exponent acts as an order parameter, with the associated critical exponent $\delta = 1/2$ near the critical point--consistent across all charge configurations studied. This supports the proposed universality of the exponent and the broader connection between dynamical chaos and thermodynamic phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering black hole phase transitions through photon spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics is a crucial and foundational aspect of black hole physics, yet its observational verification remains exceptionally challenging. The photon sphere of a black hole, a manifestation of strong gravitational effects, is intrinsically linked to its shadow, which has been directly captured through observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope. Investigating black hole thermodynamics from a gravitational perspective presents an intriguing avenue for research. This paper investigates the relationship between the thermodynamic phase transition and the photon sphere of a black hole with quantum anomaly. It proposes that the photon sphere encodes information about the black hole phase transition, arguing that the change in the photon sphere radius can serve as an order parameter characterizing the black hole's phase transition.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating and Tidal Deformation of Nonlocal Modified Tolman VII Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the moment of inertia, quadrupole deformation, and tidal deformation within the framework of nonlocal gravity, utilizing the exact modified Tolman-VII (NEMTVII) density model with an isotropic perfect fluid. The Love number~$(k_{2})$ is derived using standard even-parity perturbation theory. Additionally, we explore the observational implications by analyzing the tidal deformability parameter~$( \lambda_{\textrm{tid}} )$ in comparison with the constraints from GW170817, GW190425, PSR J0348+0432, and PSR J0740+6620. We found that the results are consistent with the tidal constraint when $\alpha \gtrsim 1.6$ with the small $\beta$. For slowly rotating object, the dimensionless moment of inertia~$( \bar{I} )$, rotational Love parameter~$( \bar{\lambda}_{\textrm{rot}} )$, and quadrupole moment~$( \bar{Q} )$ are fully determined by the perturbed metric. Our findings reveal that the nonlocal parameter~$( \beta )$ significantly affects the star radius. For a fixed $\beta$ and varying $\alpha$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations are found to be universal. For varying $\beta$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations become non-universal.</description>

      <title>Scalarization and superradiant instability of black hole induced by dark matter halo in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether a black hole(BH) surrounded by a dark matter (DM) halo has scalar hair/superradiant instability in the scalar tensor theory of gravity. In the scalar tensor theory, the coupling of matter and the scalar field creates effective mass, this effective mass causes the hairless BH to have scalar hair (spontaneous Scalarization). In the case of rotating BHs, it is also known that if the sign of the effective mass is positive, superradiant instability can occur instead of scalarization. Our study applies this effect to BHs with dark matter haloes. As a result, we confirmed that scalarization and superradiant instability occur in some of the parameter regions. In the case of small haloes, the size and mass of the halo affect the strength of scalarization, but not for astronomically large haloes, where the dependence on the coupling constant $\alpha$ is stronger. In the case of superradiance, we also confirm that for small haloes, the size and mass of the halo affect the strength of the instability and the number of unstable modes.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 13-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>Possible wormholes in generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity induced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late 1980s, Morris and Thorne led in theoretical physics by creating solutions to wormholes and formulating the crucial requirements for safe traversability of wormholes. They found that exotic matter must meet the requirement $P_r + \rho &lt; 0$, where $P_r$ is radial pressure and $\rho$ is energy density. This is a rudimentary grasp of our understanding of general relativity. In this paper, we continue their excellent work by looking at how to build traversable wormhole solutions in an extended theory of gravity. We adopt a process of linearly modifying the matter Lagrangian and the energy-momentum tensor with some coupling strengths $\lambda$ and $\chi$. This may be considered as a special case of linear $f(R, T)$ gravity with matter coupling variability or as an additively separable simple $f(R, L_m, T)$ model. We undertake a detailed analysis of static wormhole solutions with a constant redshift function. This allows us to present our results as a first-order approximation in the $f(R, L_m, T)$ scenario. We derive the wormhole shape function from the Dekel-Zhao dark matter distribution in such a way that our solutions satisfy the needed conditions for traversability as well as the requirement of exotic matter. This is particularly exciting as it shows that wormholes in $f(R, L_m, T)$ gravity can sustain both exotic as well as ordinary matter. To ensure that the shape function meets the requirement of flaring-out and is asymptotically flat, we place some constraints on the couplings. We also examine the gravitational lensing effects, which exhibit a repulsive gravitational force that appears in our extended gravity for positive couplings.</description>

      <title>Spectrum instability and greybody factor stability for parabolic approximation of Regge-Wheeler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of QNM spectra and greybody factors in the Schwarzschild black hole by approximating the Regge-Wheeler potential with a piecewise parabolic form and treating the deviation as a perturbation. We find that QNM spectra are sensitive to small perturbations, while greybody factors remain stable. This piecewise parabolic approximated potential gives rise to the long-lived modes whose imaginary parts remain close to zero and decrease slowly with overtone number increasing. The reflection coefficient shows distinct resonance feature in the high-frequency regime that are absent in the original R-W case. For the calculation of greybody factors, we employ an analytic method based on transfer matrix technique, and this approach can also be effectively used in other effective potential cases.</description>

      <title>Testing Extended Theories of Gravity via Black Hole Photon Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research delves into the optical characteristics of stationary, spherically symmetric black holes. These black holes follow the Konoplya-Zhidenko deformation rule in arbitrary gravity theories. This research finds that the effects of \(a_2\) and \(b_2\) on photon orbital dynamics exhibit observational degeneracy, while \(\varepsilon\) significantly governs photon capture characteristics. As \(\varepsilon\) increases, the radius of the photon sphere \(r_{\text{ph}}\) and the critical impact parameter \(b_{\text{ph}}\), and the innermost stable circular orbit radius \(r_{\text{isco}}\) all increase. The event horizon \( r_{\text{h}} \) corresponds to that of the Schwarzschild black hole, while the impact parameter range for the lens and photon rings is reduced. Black hole shadow and photon ring analyses across three emission models show that increasing \(\varepsilon\) shifts the peak rightward while enlarging the photon ring radius. The closer \(\varepsilon\) is to zero, the more the results approach the Schwarzschild case, the more the results approach the Schwarzschild case. Additionally, by combining EHT observational data on the shadow diameters of M87 and Sgr A*, we imposed constraints on the correlation parameter \(\varepsilon\) in the theoretical model(at the confidence level anchored by \(d_{\text{sh}}^{(M87^*)}\), the parameter \(\varepsilon\) is confined to the interval \(-0.09 \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.19\). For \(d_{\text{sh}}^{(Sgr A^*)}\), the constraint on \(\varepsilon\) is delineated as \(-0.280 \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.047\)). The results show that within the observationally allowed range of \(\varepsilon\) (such as \([-0.04, 0.04]\)), the characteristics of the black hole exhibit specific regularities with changes in \(\varepsilon\).</description>

      <title>Teleparallel dark energy in a nonflat universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmological dynamics of teleparallel dark energy in the presence of nonzero spatial geometry. Extending previous analyses of nonminimal scalar-tensor theories in the torsion-based framework, we consider different scalar field potentials and examine the resulting background evolution and linear perturbations. Adopting a dynamical systems approach, we reformulate the field equations and constrain the model parameters via a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis combining updated datasets from Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, cosmic chronometers, and growth rate measurements. Our results suggest a mild preference for an open geometry, although all models remain consistent with a flat universe at the $1\sigma$ level. Notably, Bayesian information criteria indicate that the nonflat teleparallel scenario with a vanishing potential is strongly favored over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, all teleparallel scenarios are compatible with local determinations of the Hubble constant and exhibit better agreement with low-redshift structure formation data compared to $\Lambda$CDM. These findings highlight the potential of nonflat teleparallel gravity to address current observational tensions and motivate its further investigation as a viable alternative to standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Learning and Interpreting Gravitational-Wave Features from CNNs with a Random Forest Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>It from ETH: Multi-interval Entanglement and Replica Wormholes from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula in 3D gravity for generic boundary subsystems--including RT surface phase transitions--directly from the dual two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Our approach relies on the universal statistics of the algebraic conformal data and the large-$c$ behavior of conformal blocks with Cardy boundaries involved. We observe the emergence of 3D multi-boundary black holes with Karch-Randall branes from entangled states of any number of CFT's with and without Cardy boundaries. We obtain the RT formula from the CFT, in the high-temperature regime. Two direct applications are: $\textbf{1)}$ A simple derivation of the multi-interval entanglement entropy for the vacuum state of a single CFT; $\textbf{2)}$ A CFT-based detection of the emergence of replica wormholes in the context of entanglement islands and black hole microstate counting. Our framework yields the first holographic random tensor network that faithfully captures the entanglement structure of holographic CFTs. These results imply that bulk spacetime geometries indeed emerge from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the dual field theory in the large-$c$ limit--a paradigm we refer to as $\textit{It from ETH}$.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Quantum Gravity in a Closed Lorentzian Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how meaningful physical predictions can arise in nonperturbative quantum gravity in a closed Lorentzian universe. In such settings, recent developments suggest that the quantum gravitational Hilbert space is one-dimensional and real for each $\alpha$-sector, as induced by spacetime wormholes. This appears to obstruct the conventional quantum-mechanical prescription of assigning probabilities via projection onto a basis of states. While previous approaches have introduced external observers or augmented the theory to resolve this issue, we argue that quantum gravity itself contains all the necessary ingredients to make physical predictions. We demonstrate that the emergence of classical observables and probabilistic outcomes can be understood as a consequence of partial observability: physical observers access only a subsystem of the universe. Tracing out the inaccessible degrees of freedom yields reduced density matrices that encode classical information, with uncertainties exponentially suppressed by the environment's entropy. We develop this perspective using both the Lorentzian path integral and operator formalisms and support it with a simple microscopic model. Our results show that quantum gravity in a closed universe naturally gives rise to meaningful, robust predictions without recourse to external constructs.</description>

      <title>Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: The Habitability of Exotic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative abundances of exotic environments provides us with (uninformed) bounds on the habitability of those environments relative to our own, on the basis that our presence here is not too atypical. For instance, since red stars outnumber yellow stars 7 to 3, we can infer that red stars must be less than 8.1 times as habitable as yellow, as otherwise our presence around a yellow star would be a statistical outlier at the level of $5\%$. In the multiverse context, the relative abundances of exotic environments can be drastically different from those in our universe, which sometimes allows us to place much stronger bounds on their relative habitability than we would get by restricting our attention to our universe. We apply this reasoning to a variety of different exotic environments: tidally locked planets, binary star systems, icy moons, rogue planets, liquids with properties different from water, and waterworlds. We find that the bounds on the relative habitability of rogue planets and waterworlds are at least an order of magnitude stronger in a multiverse context than from our universe alone. Additionally, the belief that some of water's special properties are essential for life, such as the fact that ice floats and, with some caveats, that it acts as a universal solvent, are incompatible with the multiverse hypothesis. If any of these bounds are found to be violated in the future, the multiverse hypothesis can be falsified to a high degree of confidence.</description>

      <title>Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, in order to be sure that unitarity is not violated, one should derived the LSZ rules for the model and check the absence of negative contributions to the $S$ matrix. In addition, the derivation of the LSZ rules is of interest, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks. This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the holographic renormalization of scalar-torsion gravity in a four-dimensional bulk spacetime with non-minimal derivative coupling. The asymptotic behavior of the static equations leads to an anti-de Sitter geometry for negative cosmological constants, allowing for a holographic interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. The existence of unique solutions throughout the bulk is addressed. We study the effect of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the conformal dimension and the expectation value of the dual scalar operator, showing that the effective bulk mass can be tuned through the non-minimal coupling. Our results provide a formalism for finding non-tachyonic bulk scalar fields which vanish at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 &lt; \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 &lt; M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta &gt; 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.</description>

      <title>Fully general relativistic description of rapidly-rotating axially-symmetric neutron stars for constraining nuclear matter equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Constraining the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) from neutron star observations is one of the main subjects in nuclear physics today. In general, neutron stars rotate rapidly and structure of neutron stars can be affected, especially in millisecond pulsars. To better constrain the nuclear EoS, it is important to describe neutron star structure taking into account the effects of rotation in a fully relativistic manner. Purpose: In this study, we investigate the internal structure of neutron stars under the influence of rotation. We explore correlations between rotational effects and EoS parameters, based on realistic calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars based on the KEH method, which provides stable solutions for axially symmetric rotating equilibrium configurations. Results: Using 5 different Skyrme EoS parameter sets, we find that the maximum angular frequency achievable by rotating neutron stars, as calculated via the KEH method, varies depending on the stiffness of the equation of state. We confirm that an increase in the rotating frequency leads to an overall increase in both the mass and radius along the M-R curve. By performing calculations at two frequently referenced neutron stars, we further examine how the changes in mass and radius correlate with the nuclear matter properties at saturation density. Our results suggest that the 716Hz rotational constraint may require a more conservative interpretation when accounting for realistic stellar deformation effects. Conclusions: To place stringent constraints on the nuclear EoS based on observational data, it is sometimes essential to account for the effects of rotation in neutron star models. In particular, the influence of rotation becomes increasingly significant at higher spin frequencies and cannot be neglected in rapidly rotating systems with $&gt;$400Hz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of linearized stability of asymptotically flat Euclidean axion wormholes found that symmetric modes suffered from divergences. We show that such divergences were an artifact of a particular way of solving the constraints, and that a full treatment leads to finite actions for such modes. The modes must thus be included in a stability analysis. However, since the action for these modes turns out to be positive, this turns out not to affect previous statements about stability of axion wormholes. We also introduce a technique that allows us to show this positivity at a pseudo-analytic level that avoids heavy numerics.

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recoil and the Unruh effect at CERN-NA63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the high energy channeling radiation data sets from the CERN-NA63 experiment using ultra relativistic synchrotron emission. To incorporate recoil, we examine the standard quasi-classical formalism as well as develop a formalism which includes the Unruh effect by utilizing a hyperbolic recoil acceleration, based on conservation of momentum, in the classical synchrotron trajectory. We also perform an asymptotic radiation time scale analysis which predicts a photon energy threshold, beyond which the Unruh effect dominates. We then compare the classical, quasi-classical, and Unruh synchrotron theories to the data. We find that above threshold, the Unruh effect saturates the spectrum of all data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that once an $\mathbb{R}^\times$-connection has been chosen, there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metric. The construction of an affine connection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.</description>

      <title>Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact solutions of quantum deficient oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process, to which exact distribution and correlation functions are constructed by utilising the correspondence between diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators, based on which this article constructs a new class of exact solutions in stochastic inflation. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactly solvable double-well model is also presented. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field strength and the spacetime curvature are part of the effective field theory of gravity and matter. They alter the local propagation of light in a significant way if the ratio of spacetime curvature to the non-minimal coupling is of order one. Spacetime curvature can become appreciable around black holes, and yet the effect of non-minimal couplings on electromagnetic observations of black holes remains underexplored. A particular feature of the non-minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field-strength and the Riemann tensor is that it generates two distinct photon rings for different polarizations. Working within the paradigm of lensing bands, and focusing on the $n=1$ photon ring, we investigate which values of the non-minimal coupling can be robustly excluded.</description>

      <title>Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions in fractional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ in Lorentzian signature and pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. This self-adjoint fractional d'Alembertian is associated with complex-conjugate poles, which are removed from the physical spectrum via the Anselmi-Piva prescription. As an example of empty spectrum, we consider a purely fractional propagator and its K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d'Alembertian, showing that the number of initial conditions is two. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the 5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function for the reduced confluent Heun problem. Furthermore, up to $O(G^2)$ we compute the dynamical $\ell=0$, and the static $\ell=1$, scalar tidal Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description for a scalar wave scattering off the black hole, to our novel ultraviolet-NS solutions. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of particles as it is used in special relativity. The presented model treats the energy-momentum relation of relativistic particles as the upper branch of a generalized energy-momentum relation of quasi particles. These particles emerge from a forbidden crossing between the constant energy of a massive particle in rest and the linear energy momentum relation of a massless particle. The lower branch, a regime dubbed as Einstein's basement, gives rise to particles with different kinematics that is analyzed in the low-velocity limit. Allowing for gravitational interaction between those particles we find both attraction and repulsion, depending on their velocity with respect to an absolute space. This absolute frame is only relevant for Einstein's basement and does not affect the relativistic dynamics of regular matter as long as no coupling between the branches is considered, while weak coupling induces local Lorentz violations. We finally discuss whether our approach can be used to model phenomena of dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signals produced by the coalescence of compact binaries progress through three stages: inspiral, merger, and postmerger. The evolution of their frequency follows a slow build up during the inspiral that peaks at merger, forming the characteristic "chirp" pattern in the signal's time-frequency map. Herein we introduce a framework for localizing further characteristic structures in the time-frequency space of gravitational wave signals using the continuous wavelet transform. We consider two example cases where there are specific patterns in the postmerger stage of the signal that are rich with information on the physical nature of the source: highly-inclined black hole binaries with asymmetric mass ratio, and neutron star binaries with postmerger remnant oscillations. It is demonstrated that the choice of quality factor $Q$ plays a central role in distinguishing the postmerger features from that of the inspiral, with black hole systems preferring lower $Q$ and neutron star systems preferring higher $Q$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of chirplets as the wavelet transform basis, which allow for manipulation of structure in the time-frequency map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, gravitational waveforms emitted by inspiralling compact binary systems on quasicircular orbits in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are computed in the lowest post-Newtonian approximation. By applying the stationary phase approximation, Fourier transforms of the tensor polarization modes are obtained, and correction terms in the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves relative to General Relativity results are derived. Moreover, post-Einsteinian parameters are identified, and potential constraints on the background value of the scalar field are obtained based on possible observations of the gravitational waves by the future ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, constraints on the background value of the scalar field are derived using updated observational data from the PSR J0737-3039 system. These latter constraints are comparable in order of magnitude to the best currently existing constraints, which were derived from observational data within the Solar System.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ay\'on-Beato Garc\'ia (ABG) solution describes a nonlinear electrodynamic nonsingular black hole in general relativity and can be regarded as a strong field correction to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution. We exam the possibility of destroying the ABG nonsingular black hole with a test charged particle and a complex scalar field. By comparing with the results of gadenken experiment to destroy the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, we get the nonlinear electrodynamic field effects on the destruction of the event horizon. We obtain the parameter regions of the particle and scalar field, which allow us to destroy the event horizon of an extremal and near-extremal ABG black hole. Our findings show that both can be destroyed due to nonlinear electrodynamic effects. Interestingly, the parameter intervals for the charged particle and scalar field needed to destroy the event horizon of an extremal black hole are identical. Since the ABG black hole is nonsingular, our results remain consistent with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and may offer a means to explore the interior of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Measurements with the Photon Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the universal symmetries of the black hole photon ring in a wide range of non-Kerr spacetimes, including the Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Sen, Kerr-Bardeen, and Kerr-Hayward metrics. The demagnification exponent ($\gamma$) controls the size and flux scaling of higher-order images, which appear in the photon ring, the time delay ($\tau$) determines the timing of their appearance, and the rotation parameter ($\delta$) relates their relative orientations on the image plane. Our investigation reveals that these critical parameters respond distinctly to variations in black hole spin, generalized charge, and observer inclination, establishing them as complementary probes of spacetime geometry: $\gamma$ is predominantly influenced by charge and spin, $\tau$ is strongly affected by inclination, especially for near-extremal black holes, and $\delta$ is highly sensitive to spin. Notably, we find that the time delay provides an independent constraint on shadow size for polar observers, while the rotation parameter facilitates metric-independent spin measurements. Specifically, for Kerr black holes, the total variation in $\gamma$, $\tau$, and $\delta$ across all possible inclinations and spins is $\lesssim 20\%$, $\lesssim 10\%$, and $\lesssim 60\%$, respectively. By contrast, the Kerr shadow radius varies by only $\lesssim 8\%$. A future joint measurement of these critical parameters -- along with the black hole shadow size -- will enable precise spacetime characterization, including measurements of the spin, inclination, and generalized charge.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre universes taking into account the different roles played by the fluid parameter and the cosmological constant, as well as the degenerate character of the equations. We find that the Friedmann-Lema\^itre system reduces to four qualitatively inequivalent normal forms and write down the sets of all stable perturbations that may result (the `versal unfoldings'). These sets are of small codimension up to three. We then describe all possible parameter-dependent solutions and their transfigurations to other forms during evolution through the bifurcation sets, these are also fully described. This analysis leads to a picture of cosmological evolution determined by new parameters related to codimension which are zero in standard cosmology. The emerging versal solutions are all free of singularities, while other properties of them are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\beta(\phi)\tilde{\cal R}$, between the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.</description>

Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational wave signals from luminous dark photon superradiance clouds with LVK O3 observations</title>

Abstract: Superradiance clouds of kinetically-mixed dark photons around spinning black holes can produce observable multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The cloud generates electric fields of up to a Teravolt-per-meter, which lead to a cascade production of charged particles, yielding a turbulent quasi-equilibrium plasma around the black hole, and resulting in electromagnetic fluxes ranging from supernova to pulsar-like luminosities. For stellar mass black holes, such systems resemble millisecond pulsars and are expected to emit pulsating radio waves and continuous gravitational waves (CWs) within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. We select 44 sources with approximately coincident frequencies or positive frequency drifts from existing pulsar catalogs as potential candidates of long-lasting superradiance clouds around old galactic black holes. For a subset of 34 sources that are well measured and have not been previously targeted, we perform the first search for CW emission in LVK data from the third observing run. We find no evidence of a CW signal and place 95% confidence level upper limits on the emitted strain amplitude. We interpret these results, together with limits from previous searches, in terms of the underlying dark photon theory by performing an analysis of the expected signals from superradiance clouds from galactic black holes. We find that, even for moderately spinning black holes, the absence of an observed CW signal disfavors a discrete set of dark photon masses between about $10^{-13}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-12}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and kinetic mixing couplings in the range of $10^{-9}$-$10^{-7}$, subject to assumptions about the properties of the black hole population and the cloud's electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>Investigating the shadows of new regular black holes with a Minkowski core: Effects of spherical accretion and core type differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shadows and optical appearances of a new type of regular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core under different spherical accretion. These BHs are constructed by modifying the Newtonian potential based on the minimum observable length in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). They correspond one-to-one with the traditional regular BHs with a de-Sitter (dS) core (such as Bardeen/Hayward BHs), characterized by quantum gravity effect parameter ($\alpha_0$) and spacetime deformation factor ($n$). We find that the characteristic parameters give rise to some novel observable features. For these new BHs, the shadow radius, photon sphere radius, and total observed intensity increase with the increase of $\alpha_0$ but decrease with the increase of $n$. Under different spherical accretion, the shadow and photon sphere radius are identical, but the total observed intensity under the static spherical accretion is greater than that under the infalling spherical accretion. In addition, we find that these regular BHs with different cores show differences in shadows and optical appearances, especially under the static spherical accretion. Compared with Bardeen BH, the new BH has a smaller total observed intensity, dimmer maximum luminosity, and smaller shadow and photon sphere radius. The larger $\alpha_0$ leads to more significant differences, and a similar trend is also seen in the comparison with Hayward BH. Under the infalling spherical accretion, these regular BHs with different cores only have slight differences in total observed intensity, shadow and photon sphere radius, which become more obvious when $\alpha_0$ is relatively large. It suggests that the unique spacetime features of these regular BHs with different cores can be distinguished through astronomical observations.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the shadows and thin accretion disks of Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) black hole. Firstly, we investigated the influence of EMS parameters on the black hole shadow using the null geodesic method and constrained these parameters based on EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*. Furthermore, we analyzed the direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring structures in EMS black hole. Comparing our results with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$m (RN) black holes, we found that the Schwarzschild black hole exhibits the largest shadow radius and the highest observed intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spherical symmetry, gravitational collapse of dust may give rise to the so-called shell-crossing singularities, beyond which spacetime can be extended using weak solutions to the integrated version of the equations of motion. We argue that the paradigm of weak solutions is ill-suited for dynamical extension beyond shell crossings through shock waves because it is based implicitly on an assumption that turns out to be unphysical for the shock and leads to the unwanted prospect of shock waves of dust particles moving faster than light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>The Constraints on the SGWB from Cosmic Strings by a HFGW Electromagnetic Resonance System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the primary detection targets for contemporary gravitational wave (GW) observatories, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the early universe's formation and evolution. Studies indicate that the SGWB spectrum from cosmic strings can span an extraordinarily broad frequency range, extending from extremely low frequencies up to the microwave band. This work specifically investigates the detectability of cosmic string SGWB signals in an electromagnetic (EM) resonance system at GHz frequency. We present a systematic analysis encompassing: (1) the response of high frequency gravitational waves (HFGW) in such EM resonance system. (2) the development and application of fundamental data processing protocols in the EM resonance system. Our results demonstrate that the EM system shows promising sensitivity to detect cosmic string SGWB signals with tension parameters $G\mu\geq 10^{-10}$ (the corresponding dimensionless amplitude $h \geq 10^{-33}$ at 1 GHz), while potentially establishing new constraints for $G\mu\leq 10^{-10}$ in the microwave band. These findings would complement existing multi-band SGWB observations and provide additional constraints on cosmic-string tension parameters in GHz frequency regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent investigation, the initial value problem of light propagation in the gravitational field of a body at rest with monopole and quadrupole structure has been determined in the second post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation. In reality, the light source as well as the observer are located at finite distances from the solar system bodies. This fact requires solving the boundary value problem of light propagation. In this investigation, the solution of the boundary value problem is deduced from the initial value problem of light propagation in 2PN approximation. These results are a basic requirement for subsequent investigations aiming at ultra-highly precise tests of light deflection and time delay in the solar system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the difference between the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}$ attributed to the Hawking radiation from the de Sitter cosmological horizon and the twice as high local temperature of the de Sitter state, $T=H/\pi=2T_{\rm GH}$, has been discussed by Hughes and Kusmartsev from the topological point of view (see arXiv:2505.05814). According to their approach, this difference is determined by the Euler characteristic $\chi({\cal M})$ of the considered spacetime with Euclidean time. The invariant $\chi({\cal M})$ is different for the global spacetime ${\cal M}=S^4$ and for the manifold limited to a region near the horizon, ${\cal M}=D^2\times S^2$. Here we consider the application of the topological approach to Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes with two horizons. Both the outer and inner horizons are characterized by their near-horizon topology, which determines the corresponding horizon temperatures. As a result of the correlation between the horizons, the entropy of the RN black hole is independent of its electric charge, being completely determined by the mass of the black hole. This demonstrates the applicability of the topological approach to the multi-horizon systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of accelerated atoms using the theory of open quantum systems. We consider two atoms travelling along different hyperbolic trajectories with different proper times. We use the generalized master equation to discuss the dynamics of a pair of dipoles interacting with the electromagnetic field. The fundamental role played by proper acceleration in the entanglement harvesting and sudden death phenomenon is discussed. Finally, we discuss how the polarization of the atoms affects our results. For some choices of the polarization's configuration, we no longer observe the entanglement harvesting phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference on an analytical model of the LISA massive black hole binary population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers will be detectable in large numbers by the Lisa Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will thus provide new insights on how they form via repeated dark matter (DM) halo and galaxy mergers. Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH--DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction. The analysis presented here constitutes a first attempt at developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to the LISA MBHB population, opening the way for several further improvements and investigations.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a substantial increase in the number count of disc galaxy lenses compared to the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we argue that disc galaxy gravitational lensing, coupled to additional astronomical observations, can be used to constrain the interpolating function of MOND.</description>

      <title>Analytical description for light propagation with the source inside the black hole photon sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. In this work, we present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons. By employing the analytical approaches, we find that the time delay between photons emitted from the interior of the photon sphere has a typical time scale of $2(\pi - \phi_\mathrm{S}) u_\mathrm{m}$ with $\phi_\mathrm{S}$ and $u_\mathrm{m}$ being respectively the azimuthal angle of the source and the impact parameter evaluated at the photon sphere, which can provide some clues on the future search for gravitational lensing signatures in the accretion inflow event.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the Search for New Physics in Pulsar Timing Data and the Case of Kination-amplified Gravitational-wave Background from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

      <title>Implications of pulsar timing arrays for Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>
