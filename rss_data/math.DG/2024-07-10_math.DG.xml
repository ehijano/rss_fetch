      <title>Corrections to a paper of Allard and Almgren on the uniqueness of tangent cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper referred to in the title is Allard/Almgren 1981 [AA81]. Several months ago Francesco Maggi emailed me saying that the inequalities 5.3(4),(5) of \cite{AA81} were wrong. In fact, as he pointed out, their incorrectness is immediately apparent if one takes $Z=0$ there. Maggi and his coauthor wanted to use these inequalities in their paper \cite{MN}. They were able to obtain a version of these inequalities which suffice for the carrying out the work in \cite{MN}. I started writing this paper in order to provide a version of these inequalities as needed in [AA81]. In thinking about this material I began to realize there were other problems with the paper. As a result I ended up {\em completely rewriting 5.1-5.4 on pages 243-248 of \cite{AA81}}; this rewrite is the contents of this paper. In addition to many annoying misprints many of the needed definitions and proofs in 5.1-5.4 are incomplete or absent. For example, it is not said where $z$ in 5.1(2) comes from; this omission completely surprised me since I remember doing a lot of work to come up with $z$ when \cite{AA81} was being written. Also, much of the necessary material about the reach of a submanifold as in \cite{FE2} is not provided in \cite{AA81}. The table of contents can serve as an index. In particular one sees there where the constants $\epsilon_1$ through $\epsilon_6$ are introduced. This material is extremely technical. One way to navigate this paper would be to start looking at Proposition 9.5 and work backwards.</description>

      <title>Regular F -manifolds with eventual identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an F-manifold one may construct a dual multiplication (generalizing the idea of an almost-dual Frobenius manifold introduced by Dubrovin) using a so-called eventual identity, the definition of which ensure that the dual object is also an F-manifold. In this paper we solve the equations for an eventual identity for a regular (so non-semi-simple) F-manifold and construct a dual coordinate system in which dual multiplication is preserved. As an application, families of Nijenhuis operators are constructed.</description>

      <title>On Sp(n)-Instantons and the Fourier-Mukai Transform of Complex Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real Fourier-Mukai (RFM) transform relates calibrated graphs to so-called "deformed instantons" on Hermitian line bundles. We show that under the RFM transform, complex Lagrangian graphs in $R^{2n} \times T^{2n}$ correspond to Sp($n$)-instantons over $R^{2n} \times (T^{2n})^*$. In other words, the deformed Sp($n$)-instanton equation coincides with the usual Sp($n$)-instanton equation.
  Motivated by this observation, we study Sp($n$)-instantons on hyperkahler manifolds $X^{4n}$, with an emphasis on conical singularities. First, when $X = C(M)$ is a hyperkahler cone, we relate Sp($n$)-instantons on $X$ to tri-contact instantons on the 3-Sasakian link $M$ and consider various dimensional reductions. Second, when $X$ is an asymptotically conical (AC) hyperkahler manifold of rate $\nu \leq -\frac{2}{3}(2n+1)$, we prove a Lewis-type theorem to the following effect: If the set of AC Sp($n$)-instantons is non-empty, then every AC Hermitian Yang-Mills connection over $X$ with sufficiently fast decay at infinity is an Sp($n$)-instanton.</description>

      <title>Ricci-DeTurck Flow from Initial Metric with Morrey-type Integrability Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the short-time existence theory of Ricci-DeTurck flow starting from rough metrics which satisfy a Morrey-type integrability condition. Using the rough existence theory, we show the preservation and improvement of distributional scalar curvature lower bounds provided the singular set for such metrics is not too large. As an application, we use the Ricci flow smoothing to study the removable singularity in positive mass theorem under Morrey regularity conditions. Our result supplements those of Jiang-Sheng-Zhang.</description>

      <title>The zeta-determinants and anlaytic torsion of a metric mapping torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the BFK-gluing formula for zeta-determinants to compute the zeta-determinant and analytic torsion of a metric mapping torus induced from an isometry. As applications, we compute the zeta-determinants of the Laplacians defined on a Klein bottle ${\mathbb K}$ and some compact co-K\"ahler manifold ${\mathbb T}_{\varphi}$. We also show that a metric mapping torus and a Riemannian product manifold with a round circle have the same heat trace asymptotic expansions. We finally compute the analytic torsion of a metric mapping torus for the Witten deformed Laplacian and recover the result of J. Marcsik in \cite{Ma}.</description>

      <title>Ricci solitons as submanifolds of complex hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any homogeneous expanding Ricci soliton is known to be isometric to a Lie subgroup of the solvable part of the Iwasawa decomposition associated with a symmetric space of non-compact type, with the metric induced as a submanifold. In this paper, we classify and analyze the geometry of such Lie subgroups with Ricci soliton induced metric when the symmetric spaces are complex hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Morse index of free-boundary CMC hypersurfaces in the upper hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove results for free-boundary hypersurfaces in the upper unit hemisphere $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}_{+}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. First we show that if the norm squared of the second fundamental form is constant, the Morse index of a free-boundary minimal hypersurface $\Sigma\subset \mathbb{S}^{n+1}_{+}$ equals: $1$ if $\Sigma$ is a totally geodesic equator, $n+1$ if $\Sigma$ is half of the Clifford torus, or it is at least $2(n+1)$ when $\Sigma$ is not totally geodesic. Next we prove an estimate for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the second variation's Jacobi operator, and show that $\lambda_1 \leq -2n$ if $\Sigma$ is not totally geodesic, with equality iff $\Sigma$ is half of the minimal Clifford torus. Furthermore, $\lambda_1 = -n$ iff $\Sigma$ is totally geodesic. Finally, if $\Sigma$ is not totally umbilical the Morse index is at least $n+1$, with equality precisely when $\Sigma$ is the upper $\mathrm{H}$-torus. For totally umbilical hypersurfaces the Morse index is $1$. We also prove an upper bound for the first eigenvalue of free-boundary $\mathrm{CMC}$ hypersurfaces, where equality corresponds to totally umbilical hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Graph Ricci Curvature and Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between curvature and topology is a very well-studied theme in the subject of differential geometry. By suitably defining curvature on networks, the study of this theme has been extended into the domain of network analysis as well. In particular, this has led to curvature-based community detection algorithms. In this paper, we reveal the relation between community structure of a network and the curvature of its edges. In particular, we give apriori bounds on the curvature of intercommunity edges of a graph.</description>

      <title>Classical relativistic nonholonomic mechanics and time-dependent $G$-Chaplygin systems with affine constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relativistic formulation of a classical time-dependent nonholonomic Lagrangian mechanics from the perspective of moving frames. We also introduce time-dependent $G$-Chaplygin systems with affine constraints, which are natural objects for the invariant formulation of nonholonomic systems with symmetries. As far as the author is aware, the Hamiltonization problem for time-dependent constraints has not yet been studied. As a first step in this direction, we consider a rolling without sliding of a balanced disc of radius $r$ over a vertical circle of variable radius $R(t)$. We modify the Chaplygin multiplier method and prove that the reduced system becomes the usual Lagrangian system with respect to the new time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric characterization of flag geometries associated to Hitchin representations in $\text{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$. Our characterization is based on distinguished invariant foliations, similar to those studied by Guichard-Wienhard in $\text{PSL}_4(\mathbb{R})$.
  We connect to the dynamics of Hitchin representations by constructing refraction flows for all positive roots in general $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{R})$ in our setting. For $n = 3$, leaves of our one-dimensional foliations are flow-lines. One consequence is that the highest root flows are $C^{1+\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of the total $Q$-curvature near minimizing metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under appropriate positivity hypotheses, we prove quantitative estimates for the total $k$-th order $Q$-curvature functional near minimizing metrics on any smooth, closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold for every integer $1 \leq k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$. More precisely, we show that on a generic closed Riemannian manifold the distance to the minimizing set of metrics is controlled quadratically by the $Q$-curvature energy deficit, extending recent work by Engelstein, Neumayer and Spolaor in the case $k=1$. Next we prove, for any integer $1 \leq k&lt; \frac{n}{2}$, the existence of an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold such that the $k$-th order $Q$-curvature deficit controls a higher power of the distance to the minimizing set. We believe that these degenerate examples are of independent interest and can be used for further development in the field.</description>

      <title>Natural volume forms on pseudo-Finslerian manifolds with $m$-th root metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define natural volume forms on $n$-dimensional oriented pseudo-Finslerian manifolds with non-degenerate $m$-th root metrics. Our definitions of the natural volume forms depend on the parity of the positive integer $m&gt;1$. The advantage of the stated definitions is their algebraic structure. The natural volume forms are expressed in terms of Cayley hyperdeterminants. In particular, the computation of the natural volume form does not require the difficult integration over the domain within the indicatrix in the tangent space $T_x M^n$ of the pseudo-Finslerian manifold at a point $x$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and classification of solutions to an integral equation in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove symmetry of nonnegative solutions of the integral equation \[ u (\zeta ) = \int\limits_{{\mathbb H}^n} |\zeta^{-1} \xi|^{-(Q-\alpha)} u(\xi)^{p} d\xi \quad 1&lt; p \leq \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha},\quad 0&lt; \alpha &lt;Q \] on the Heisenberg group ${\mathbb H}^n = {\mathbb C}^n \times {\mathbb R}$, $Q= 2n +2$ using the moving plane method and the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality proved by Frank and Lieb for the Heisenberg group. For $p$ subcritical, i.e., $1&lt; p &lt; \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha}$ we show nonexistence of positive solution of this integral equation, while for the critical case, $p = \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha}$ we prove that the solutions are cylindrical and are unique upto Heisenberg translation and suitable scaling of the function \[ u_0 (z,t) = \left( (1+ |z|^2)^2 + t^2 \right)^{- \frac{Q-\alpha}{4}} \quad (z,t ) \in {\mathbb H}^n. \] As a consequence, we also obtain the symmetry and classification of nonnegative $C^2$ solution of the equation \[ \Delta_{\mathbb H} u + u^{p} = 0 \quad \mbox{for } 1&lt; p \leq \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha} \mbox{ in } {\mathbb H}^n \] without any partial symmetry assumption on the function $u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on local curvature invariants associated with bi-Lagrangian structures. We establish several geometric conditions that determine when the canonical connection is flat, building on our previous findings regarding divergence-free webs. Addressing questions raised by Tabachnikov, we provide complete solutions to two problems: the existence of flat bi-Lagrangian structures within the space of rays induced by a pair of hypersurfaces, and the existence of flat bi-Lagrangian structures induced by tangents to Lagrangian curves in the symplectic plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Floer cohomology and the Fukaya category are not defined in general. Indeed, while the issue of obstructions can be theoretically addressed by introducing bounding cochains, the actual existence of even one such bounding cochain is usually unknown. This paper aims to deal with the problem. We study certain non-archimedean analytic structure that enriches the Maurer-Cartan theory of bounding cochains. Using this rigid structure and family Floer techniques, we prove that within a connected family of graded Lagrangian submanifolds, if any one Lagrangian is unobstructed (in a slightly stronger sense), then all remaining Lagrangians are automatically unobstructed.</description>

Abstract: We prove a gluing theorem for linearised vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge on a class of characteristic hypersurfaces in static vacuum $(n+1)$-dimensional backgrounds with cosmological constant $ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $n\ge 4$. This generalises, in the linearised case, the pioneering analysis of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out on light cones in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>
