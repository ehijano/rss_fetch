      <title>Soliton Thouless pumping engineered by inter-site nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study soliton Thouless pumping in an extended diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with on-site nonlinearities and inter-site nonlinearities. We show that the inter-site nonlinearities can make solitons acquire anomalous transport distances far beyond the ones predicted by the linear bands, and the quantized displacements can be engineered well. We uncover that nonlinear instabilities require lower limits on sweeping rates for soliton pumping, challenging the common notion that slower modulation enables a more favorable realization of topological transport. The nonlinear interactions between solitons make multi-soliton pumping generally lack the robustness characteristic of Thouless pumping as linear systems. Our results provide many possibilities to engineer topological pumping by nonlinearities, and further make a step for applications of soliton pumping.</description>

      <title>On the Practical Estimation and Interpretation of R\'enyi Transfer Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R\'enyi transfer entropy (RTE) is a generalization of classical transfer entropy that replaces Shannon's entropy with R\'enyi's information measure. This, in turn, introduces a new tunable parameter $\alpha$, which accounts for sensitivity to low- or high-probability events. Although RTE shows strong potential for analyzing causal relations in complex, non-Gaussian systems, its practical use is limited, primarily due to challenges related to its accurate estimation and interpretation. These difficulties are especially pronounced when working with finite, high-dimensional, or heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of a k-nearest neighbor estimator for both R\'enyi entropy (RE) and RTE using various synthetic data sets with clear cause-and-effect relationships inherent to their construction. We test the estimator across a broad range of parameters, including sample size, dimensionality, memory length, and R\'enyi order $\alpha$. In particular, we apply the estimator to a set of simulated processes with increasing structural complexity, ranging from linear dynamics to nonlinear systems with multi-source couplings. To address interpretational challenges arising from potentially negative RE and RTE values, we introduce three reliability conditions and formulate practical guidelines for tuning the estimator parameters. We show that when the reliability conditions are met and the parameters are calibrated accordingly, the resulting effective RTE estimates accurately capture directional information flow across a broad range of scenarios. Results obtained show that the explanatory power of RTE depends sensitively on the choice of the R\'{e}nyi parameter $\alpha$. This highlights the usefulness of the RTE framework for identifying the drivers of extreme behavior in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical state dynamics modes and equilibria underlie the structure and mechanism of wide channel Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide channel Couette (WCC) turbulence is striking in being dominated by a large-scale spanwise periodic structure composed of streamwise streaks and associated roll superstructures. This apparent equilibrium is shown in this work to correspond to a fixed point solution of the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework. Moreover, this fixed point solution is found to be rank-three, consisting of one analytically identified roll-streak structure (RSS) constituting the first cumulant of the SSD, and two analytically determined eigenmodes supporting the second cumulant. This minimal representation captures both the structure and the dynamics of WCC turbulence, while the remaining spectral components contribute negligibly to the equilibrium dynamics. Turbulent Couette flows other than WCC can be understood to be limit cycle and chaotic extensions supported by the same underlying mechanism as the fixed point WCC turbulence except for the two eigenmodes supporting WCC turbulence being replaced by two Floquet modes and two Lyapunov vectors, respectively. These results provide an analytic solution for turbulence in Couette flow.</description>

      <title>A split-step Christov method for approximating rational PDE solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are notoriously difficult to approximate via spectral Fourier methods due to their algebraically slow decay rate. In this work we discuss approximating rational PDE solutions in a basis of orthogonal functions known as the Fourier series, allowing for the computation of its spectrum via the fast Fourier transform. Spectral differentiation matrices are derived. Several explicit fourth-order split-step integrators are derived and their performance compared. As an application, rogue wave solutions in a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations are explored. Perturbing the constant background is found to generate rogue wave-like structures. The effects of higher-order dispersion and generalized nonlinearities are also examined.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>
