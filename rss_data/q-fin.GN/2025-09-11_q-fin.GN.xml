      <title>Digital Transformation and Corporate Financial Asset Allocation: Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of rapid technological advancement and the deepening digital economy, this study examines the causal impact of digital transformation on corporate financial asset allocation in China. Using data from A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2022, we construct a firm-level digitalization index based on text analysis of annual reports and differentiate financial asset allocation into long-term and short-term dimensions. Employing fixed-effects models and a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) design, we find that digital transformation significantly promotes corporate financial asset allocation, with a more pronounced effect on short-term than long-term allocations. Mechanism analyses reveal that digitalization operates through dual channels: broadening investment avenues and enhancing information processing capabilities. Specifically, it enables firms to allocate long-term high-yield financial instruments, thereby optimizing the maturity structure of assets, while also improving information efficiency, curbing inefficient investments, and reallocating capital toward more productive financial assets. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that firms in non-eastern regions, state-owned enterprises, and larger firms are more responsive in short-term allocation, whereas eastern regions, non-state-owned enterprises, and small and medium-sized enterprises benefit more in long-term allocation. Our findings provide micro-level evidence and mechanistic insights into how digital transformation reshapes corporate financial decision-making, offering important implications for both policymakers and firms.</description>
