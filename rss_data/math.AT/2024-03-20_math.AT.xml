      <title>Non-accessible localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 2005 paper, Casacuberta, Scevenels and Smith construct a homotopy idempotent functor $E$ on the category of simplicial sets with the property that whether it can be expressed as localization with respect to a map $f$ is independent of the ZFC axioms. We show that this construction can be carried out in homotopy type theory. More precisely, we give a general method of associating to a suitable (possibly large) family of maps, a reflective subuniverse of any universe $\mathcal{U}$. When specialized to an appropriate family, this produces a localization which when interpreted in the $\infty$-topos of spaces agrees with the localization corresponding to $E$. Our approach generalizes the approach of [CSS] in two ways. First, by working in homotopy type theory, our construction can be interpreted in any $\infty$-topos. Second, while the local objects produced by [CSS] are always 1-types, our construction can produce $n$-types, for any $n$. This is new, even in the $\infty$-topos of spaces. In addition, by making use of universes, our proof is very direct.
  Along the way, we prove many results about "small" types that are of independent interest. As an application, we give a new proof that separated localizations exist. We also give results that say when a localization with respect to a family of maps can be presented as localization with respect to a single map, and show that the simplicial model satisfies a strong form of the axiom of choice which implies that sets cover and that the law of excluded middle holds.</description>

      <title>The homotopy decomposition of the suspension of a non-simply-connected $5$-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we determine the homotopy types of the reduced suspension space of certain connected orientable closed smooth $5$-manifolds. As applications, we compute the reduced $K$-groups of $M$ and show that the suspension map between the third cohomotopy set $\pi^3(M)$ and the fourth cohomotopy set $\pi^4(\Sigma M)$ is a bijection.</description>

      <title>Reducing Rouquier Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe reduced representatives for positive Rouquier complexes. These are obtained via \emph{Morse theoretical} Gaussian elimination from the corresponding standard representatives. The underlying graded object is still a direct sum of Bott-Samelson objects, but over subwords rather than subexpressions.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of natural directed paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract setting of presheaf category on a thick category of cubes. Precubical sets, symmetric transverse sets, symmetric precubical sets and the new category of (non-symmetric) transverse sets are examples of this structure. All these presheaf categories share the same metric and homotopical properties from a directed homotopy point of view. This enables us to extend Raussen's notion of natural $d$-path for each of them. Finally, we adapt Ziemia\'{n}ski's notion of cube chain to this abstract setting and we prove that it has the expected behavior on precubical sets. As an application, we verify that the formalization of the parallel composition with synchronization of process algebra using the coskeleton functor of the category of symmetric transverse sets has a category of cube chains with the correct homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Stability and Approximations for Decorated Reeb Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a map $f:X \to M$ from a topological space $X$ to a metric space $M$, a decorated Reeb space consists of the Reeb space, together with an attribution function whose values recover geometric information lost during the construction of the Reeb space. For example, when $M=\mathbb{R}$ is the real line, the Reeb space is the well-known Reeb graph, and the attributions may consist of persistence diagrams summarizing the level set topology of $f$. In this paper, we introduce decorated Reeb spaces in various flavors and prove that our constructions are Gromov-Hausdorff stable. We also provide results on approximating decorated Reeb spaces from finite samples and leverage these to develop a computational framework for applying these constructions to point cloud data.</description>
