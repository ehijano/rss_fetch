      <title>Algebraic Complete Integrability of the (a_4^{\left(2\right)}) Toda lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is focused on the investigation of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i) of the Toda lattice associated with the twisted affine Lie algebra (a_4^{\left(2\right)}). First, we prove that the generic fiber of the momentum map for this system is an affine part of an abelian surface. Second, we show that the flows of integrable vector fields on this surface are linear. Finally, using the formal Laurent solutions of the system, we provide a detailed geometric description of these abelian surfaces and the divisor at infinity.</description>

      <title>Discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations: Solutions and continuum limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As local and nonlocal reductions of a discrete second-order Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur equation, two discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations are considered. Through the bilinearization reduction method, we construct double Casoratian solutions of the reduced discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations, including soliton solutions and Jordan-block solutions.Dynamics of the obtained one-soliton and two-soliton solutions are analyzed and illustrated. Moreover,both semi-continuous limit and full continuous limit, are applied to obtain solutions of the local and nonlocal semi-discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations, as well as the local and nonlocal continuous nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations.</description>

      <title>Solutions of local and nonlocal discrete complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equations and continuum limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cauchy matrix approach for the discrete Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur equations is reconsidered, where two `proper' discrete Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur equations and two `unproper' discrete Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur equations are derived. The `proper' equations admit local reduction, while the `unproper' equations admit nonlocal reduction. By imposing the local and nonlocal complex reductions on the obtained discrete Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur equations, two local and nonlocal discrete complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equations are constructed. For the obtained local and nonlocal discrete complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equations, soliton solutions and Jordan-block solutions are presented by solving the determining equation set. The dynamical behaviors of 1-soliton solution are analyzed and illustrated. Continuum limits of the resulting local and nonlocal discrete complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discrete non-commutative hungry Toda lattice and its application in matrix computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we plan to show an eigenvalue algorithm for block Hessenberg matrices by using the idea of non-commutative integrable systems and matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. We introduce adjacent families of matrix-valued $\theta$-deformed bi-orthogonal polynomials, and derive corresponding discrete non-commutative hungry Toda lattice from discrete spectral transformations for polynomials. It is shown that this discrete system can be used as a pre-precessing algorithm for block Hessenberg matrices. Besides, some convergence analysis and numerical examples of this algorithm are presented.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes equations for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the resulting fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled 1d cold-atomic gases.</description>

Abstract: Bazhanov--Stroganov (4-simplex) maps are set-theoretical solutions to the 4-simplex equation, namely the fourth member of the family of $n$-simplex equations, which are fundamental equations of mathematical physics. In this paper, we develop a method for constructing Bazhanov--Stroganov maps as extensions of tetrahedron maps which are set-theoretical solutions to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron (3-simplex) equation. We employ this method to construct birarional Bazhanov--Stroganov maps which boil down to the famous electric network and Hirota tetrahedron maps at a certain limit.</description>

      <title>Stationary coupled KdV systems and their St\"ackel representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate stationary cKdV systems and prove that every $N$-field stationary cKdV system can be written, after a careful reparametrization of jet variables, as a classical separable St\"ackel system on $N+1$ different ways. For each of these $N+1$ parametrizations we present an explicit map between the jet variables and the separation variables of the system. Finally, we show that each pair of St\"ackel representations of the same stationary cKdV system, when considered in the phase space extended by Casimir variables, is connected by an appropriate finite-dimensional Miura map, which leads to an $(N+1)$-Hamiltonian formulation for the stationary cKdV system.</description>

      <title>Remarks on integrability of N=1 supersymmetric Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrability of N=1 supersymmetric Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body models based upon the potentials W(x)=2/x, W(x)=2/sin(x), and W(x)=2/sinh(x) is proven. The problem of constructing an algebraically resolvable set of Grassmann-odd constants of motion is reduced to finding a triplet of vectors such that all their scalar products can be expressed in terms of the original bosonic first integrals. The supersymmetric generalizations are used to build novel integrable (iso)spin extensions of the respective Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body systems.</description>

      <title>Prepotential Approach: a unified approach to exactly, quasi-exactly, and rationally extended solvable quantal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of a simple and unified way, called the prepotential approach, to treat both exact and quasi-exact solvabilities of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. It is based on the prepotential together with Bethe ansatz equations. Unlike the the supersymmetric method for the exactly-solvable systems and the Lie-algebraic approach for the quasi-exactly solvable problems, this approach does not require any knowledge of the underlying symmetry of the system. It treats both quasi-exact and exact solvabilities on the same footing. In this approach the system is completely defined by the choice of two polynomials and a set of Bethe ansatz equations. The potential, the change of variables as well as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are determined in the same process. We illustrate the approach by several paradigmatic examples of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real energies. Hermitian systems with complex energies, called the quasinormal modes, are also presented. Extension of the approach to the newly discovered rationally extended models is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Unveiling chiral states of the XXZ chain: Finite-size scaling as a probe of quantum phase transition in symmetry-enriched $c=1$ conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy properties of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain with time-reversal symmetry-breaking pseudo-scalar chiral interaction and propose a phase diagram for the model. In the integrable case of the isotropic Heisenberg model with the chiral interaction, we employ the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to find ``chiralization", the response of the ground state versus the strength of the pseudo-scalar chiral interaction of a chiral Heisenberg chain. Unlike the magnetization case, the chirality of the ground state remains zero until the transition point corresponding to critical coupling $\alpha_c=2J/\pi$ with $J$ being the antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The central-charge $c=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) describe the two phases with zero and finite chirality. We show for this particular case and conjecture more generally for similar phase transitions that the difference between two emergent CFTs with identical central charges lies in the symmetry of their ground state (lightest weight) primary fields, i.e., the two phases are symmetry-enriched CFTs. At finite but small temperatures, the non-chiral Heisenberg phase acquires a finite chirality that scales with the temperature quadratically. We show that the finite-size effect around the transition point probes the transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Fokker-Planck equations that interpolate a pair of supersymmetrically related Fokker-Planck equations with constant coefficients. Based on the interesting property of shape-invariance, various one-parameter interpolations of the solutions of the supersymmetric pair of Fokker-Planck systems can be directly constructed.</description>
