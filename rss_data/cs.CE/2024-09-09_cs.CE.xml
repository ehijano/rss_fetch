      <title>CryptoAnalytics: Cryptocoins Price Forecasting with Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CryptoAnalytics, a software toolkit for cryptocoins price forecasting with machine learning (ML) techniques. Cryptocoins are tradable digital assets exchanged for specific trading prices. While history has shown the extreme volatility of such trading prices, the ability to efficiently model and forecast the time series resulting from the exchange price volatility remains an open research challenge. Good results can been achieved with state-of-the-art ML techniques, including Gradient-Boosting Machines (GBMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CryptoAnalytics is a software toolkit to easily train these models and make inference on up-to-date cryptocoin trading price data, with facilities to fetch datasets from one of the main leading aggregator websites, i.e., CoinMarketCap, train models and infer the future trends. This software is implemented in Python. It relies on PyTorch for the implementation of RNNs (LSTM and GRU), while for GBMs, it leverages on XgBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.</description>

      <title>Deep learning modelling of manufacturing and build variations on multi-stage axial compressors aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of deep learning to physical simulations such as Computational Fluid Dynamics have recently experienced a surge in interest, and their viability has been demonstrated in different domains. However, due to the highly complex, turbulent and three-dimensional flows, they have not yet been proven usable for turbomachinery applications. Multi-stage axial compressors for gas turbine applications represent a remarkably challenging case, due to the high-dimensionality of the regression of the flow-field from geometrical and operational variables. This paper demonstrates the development and application of a deep learning framework for predictions of the flow field and aerodynamic performance of multi-stage axial compressors. A physics-based dimensionality reduction unlocks the potential for flow-field predictions, as it re-formulates the regression problem from an un-structured to a structured one, as well as reducing the number of degrees of freedom. Compared to traditional "black-box" surrogate models, it provides explainability to the predictions of overall performance by identifying the corresponding aerodynamic drivers. This is applied to model the effect of manufacturing and build variations, as the associated performance scatter is known to have a significant impact on $CO_2$ emissions, therefore posing a challenge of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed architecture is proven to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the CFD benchmark, in real-time, for an industrially relevant application. The deployed model, is readily integrated within the manufacturing and build process of gas turbines, thus providing the opportunity to analytically assess the impact on performance with actionable and explainable data.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>
