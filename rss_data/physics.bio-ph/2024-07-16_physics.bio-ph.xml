      <title>Modeling Ion-Specific Effects in Polyelectrolyte Brushes: A Modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte brushes consist of a set of charged linear macromolecules each tethered at one end to a surface. An example is the glycocalyx which refers to hair-like negatively charged sugar molecules that coat the outside membrane of all cells. We consider the transport and equilibrium distribution of ions, and the resulting electrical potential, when such a brush is immersed in a salt buffer containing monovalent cations (sodium and/or potassium). The Gouy-Chapman model for ion screening at a charged surface captures the effects of the Coulombic force that drives ion electrophoresis and diffusion, but neglects non-Coulombic forces and ion pairing. By including the distinct binding affinities of these counter-ions with the brush, and their so-called Born radii, which account for Born forces acting on them when the permittivity is non-uniform, we propose modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck continuum models that show the distinct profiles that may result depending on those ion-specific properties.</description>

      <title>Metabolic activity controls the emergence of coherent flows in microbial suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthetic microbes have evolved and successfully adapted to the ever-changing environmental conditions in complex microhabitats throughout almost all ecosystems on Earth. In the absence of light, they can sustain their biological functionalities through aerobic respiration, and even in anoxic conditions through anaerobic metabolic activity. For a suspension of photosynthetic microbes in an anaerobic environment, individual cellular motility is directly controlled by its photosynthetic activity, i.e. the intensity of the incident light absorbed by chlorophyll. The effects of the metabolic activity on the collective motility on the population level, however, remain elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate that at high light intensities, a suspension of photosynthetically active microbes exhibits a stable reverse sedimentation profile of the cell density due to the microbes' natural bias to move against gravity. With decreasing photosynthetic activity, and therefore suppressed individual motility, the living suspension becomes unstable giving rise to coherent bioconvective flows. The collective motility is fully reversible and manifests as regular, three-dimensional plume structures, in which flow rates and cell distributions are directly controlled via the light intensity. The coherent flows emerge in the highly unfavourable condition of lacking both light and oxygen and, thus, might help the microbial collective to expand the exploration of their natural habitat in search for better survival conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparing AI versus Optimization Workflows for Simulation-Based Inference of Spatial-Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.</description>

      <title>A mean field analysis of the role of indirect transmission in emergent infection events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a mathematical model to investigate the role of indirect transmission in the spread of infectious diseases, using the illustrative example of sarcoptic mange as a case study. This disease can be transmitted through direct contact between an infected host and a susceptible one, or indirectly when potential hosts encounter infectious mites and larvae deposited in the environment, commonly referred to as fomites. Our focus is on exploring the potential of these infectious reservoirs as triggers for emerging infection events and as stable reservoirs of the disease. To achieve this, our mean field compartmental model incorporates the epidemiological dynamics driven by indirect transmission via fomites. We identify different types of dynamics that the system can go into, controlled by different levels of direct and indirect transmission. Among these, we find a new regime where the disease can emerge and persist over time solely through fomites, without the necessity for direct transmission. This possibility of the system reveals an evolutionary pathway that could enable the parasite to enhance its fitness beyond host co-evolution. We also define a new threshold based on an effective reproductive number, that enables us to predict the conditions for disease persistence. Our model allows us to assess the potential effectiveness of various disease intervention measures by incorporating a feature observed in real systems. We hope this contributes to a better understanding of infectious disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>FEBio FINESSE: An open-source finite element simulation approach to estimate in vivo heart valve strains using shape enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite element simulations are an enticing tool to evaluate heart valve function in healthy and diseased patients; however, patient-specific simulations derived from 3D echocardiography are hampered by several technical challenges. In this work, we present an open-source method to enforce matching between finite element simulations and in vivo image-derived heart valve geometry in the absence of patient-specific material properties, leaflet thickness, and chordae tendineae structures. We evaluate FEBio Finite Element Simulations with Shape Enforcement (FINESSE) using three synthetic test cases covering a wide range of model complexity. Our results suggest that FINESSE can be used to not only enforce finite element simulations to match an image-derived surface, but to also estimate the first principal leaflet strains within +/- 0.03 strain. Key FINESSE considerations include: (i) appropriately defining the user-defined penalty, (ii) omitting the leaflet commissures to improve simulation convergence, and (iii) emulating the chordae tendineae behavior via prescribed leaflet free edge motion or a chordae emulating force. We then use FINESSE to estimate the in vivo valve behavior and leaflet strains for three pediatric patients. In all three cases, FINESSE successfully matched the target surface with median errors similar to or less than the smallest voxel dimension. Further analysis revealed valve-specific findings, such as the tricuspid valve leaflet strains of a 2-day old patient with HLHS being larger than those of two 13-year old patients. The development of this open source pipeline will enable future studies to begin linking in vivo leaflet mechanics with patient outcomes</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm to compute the minimum free energy of interacting nucleic acid strands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information-encoding molecules RNA and DNA form a combinatorially large set of secondary structures through nucleic acid base pairing. Thermodynamic prediction algorithms predict favoured, or minimum free energy (MFE), secondary structures, and can assign an equilibrium probability to any structure via the partition function: a Boltzman-weighted sum over the set of secondary structures. MFE is NP-hard in the presence pseudoknots, base pairings that violate a restricted planarity condition. However, unpseudoknotted structures are amenable to dynamic programming: for a single DNA/RNA strand there are polynomial time algorithms for MFE and partition function. For multiple strands, the problem is more complicated due to entropic penalties. Dirks et al [SICOMP Review; 2007] showed that for O(1) strands, with N bases, there is a polynomial time in N partition function algorithm, however their technique did not generalise to MFE which they left open. We give the first polynomial time (O(N^4)) algorithm for unpseudoknotted multiple (O(1)) strand MFE, answering the open problem from Dirks et al. The challenge lies in considering rotational symmetry of secondary structures, a feature not immediately amenable to dynamic programming algorithms. Our proof has two main technical contributions: First, a polynomial upper bound on the number of symmetric secondary structures to be considered when computing rotational symmetry penalties. Second, that bound is leveraged by a backtracking algorithm to find the MFE in an exponential space of contenders. Our MFE algorithm has the same asymptotic run time as Dirks et al's partition function algorithm, suggesting efficient handling of rotational symmetry, although higher space complexity. It also seems reasonably tight in the number of strands since Codon, Hajiaghayi &amp; Thachuk [DNA27, 2021] have shown that unpseudoknotted MFE is NP-hard for O(N) strands.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction and its various reduced ones as well as the relativistic corrections. Examples are such as the electron-phonon interaction, the Heisenberg exchange spin interaction, the superexchange interaction, the van der Waals interaction, the spin-orbit interaction, the Breit interaction, {\it etc}. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical or chemical properties of the matters or the biological activity of the living organisms on Earth at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Coulomb interaction relevant Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes describe a basic theory of chemically active droplets, which are droplets kept away from equilibrium by driven chemical reactions. The notes assume a basic familiarity with equilibrium thermodynamics of phase separation, and thus focus on three separate themes, which were discussed in three separate lectures: (i) The kinetics of phase separation, including the early-stage dynamics of spinodal decomposition and the late-stage dynamics of Ostwald ripening. (ii) Transition state theory as a simple, thermodynamically-consistent kinetic theory of chemical reactions, which permits explicit driving in open systems. (iii) The combination of phase separation and reactions, leading to active droplets. We discuss the two fundamental classes of internally-maintained and externally-maintained droplets. A simple version of externally-maintained droplets permits an effective electrostatic analogy, which indicates how the reaction-diffusion system mediates long-ranged interactions. All these aspects are discussed in the context of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Simulation and Modeling of Complex Systems using Dynamical Graph Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dynamical Graph Grammar (DGG) formalism can describe complex system dynamics with graphs that are mapped into a master equation. An exact stochastic simulation algorithm may be used, but it is slow for large systems. To overcome this problem, an approximate spatial stochastic/deterministic simulation algorithm, which uses spatial decomposition of the system's time-evolution operator through an expanded cell complex (ECC), was previously developed and implemented for a cortical microtubule array (CMA) model. Here, computational efficiency is improved at the cost of introducing errors confined to interactions between adjacent subdomains of different dimensions, realized as some events occurring out of order. A rule instances to domains mapping function $\phi$, ensures the errors are local. This approach has been further refined and generalized in this work. Additional efficiency is achieved by maintaining an incrementally updated match data structure for all possible rule matches. The API has been redesigned to support DGG rules in general, rather than for one specific model. To demonstrate these improvements in the algorithm, we have developed the Dynamical Graph Grammar Modeling Library (DGGML) and a DGG model for the periclinal face of the plant cell CMA. This model explores the effects of face shape and boundary conditions on local and global alignment. For a rectangular face, different boundary conditions reorient the array between the long and short axes. The periclinal CMA DGG demonstrates the flexibility and utility of DGGML, and these new methods highlight DGGs' potential for testing, screening, or generating hypotheses to explain emergent phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a filament transmit the curvatures across the constituting modules and control them at one of its end? Inspired by the observation of protofilament - constituent biopolymer of microtubule - this question is addressed by a constructive approach. In our model a simple allosteric element in each module couples with the neighboring modules at its interfaces, which gives rise to a single degree of freedom to control the global shape of the filament. The model can be analyzed in analogy with discrete-time dynamical systems having a bifurcation of trans-critical type.</description>

      <title>ITRUSST Consensus on Biophysical Safety for Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is an emerging technology for non-invasive brain stimulation. In a series of meetings, the International Consortium for Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) has established expert consensus on considerations for the biophysical safety of TUS, drawing upon the relevant diagnostic ultrasound literature and regulations. This report reflects a consensus expert opinion and can inform but not replace regulatory guidelines or official international standards. Their establishment by international and national commissions will follow expert consensus. Similarly, this consensus will inform but not replace ethical evaluation, which will consider aspects beyond biophysical safety relevant to burden, risk, and benefit, such as physiological effects and disease-specific interactions. Here, we assume the application of TUS to persons who are not at risk for thermal or mechanical damage, and without ultrasound contrast agents. In this context, we present a concise yet comprehensive set of levels for a nonsignificant risk of TUS application. For mechanical effects, it is safe if the mechanical index (MI) or the mechanical index for transcranial application (MItc) does not exceed 1.9. For thermal effects, it is safe if any of the following three levels are met: a temperature rise less than 2 C, a thermal dose less than 0.25 CEM43, or specific values of the thermal index (TI) for a given exposure time. We review literature relevant to our considerations and discuss limitations and future developments of our approach.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probability Currents in Optically-Driven Colloidal Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of directional motion it is often hard to recognize athermal fluctuations. Probability currents provide such a measure in terms of the rate at which they enclose area in the reduced phase space. We measure this area enclosing rate for trapped colloidal particles, where only one particle is driven. By combining experiment, theory, and simulation, we single out the effect of the different time scales in the system on the measured probability currents. In this controlled experimental setup, particles interact hydrodynamically. These interactions lead to a strong spatial dependence of the probability currents and to a local influence of athermal agitation. In a multiple-particle system, we show that even when the driving acts only on one particle, probability currents occur between other, non-driven particles. This may have significant implications for the interpretation of fluctuations in biological systems containing elastic networks in addition to a suspending fluid.</description>

      <title>Flocking by Turning Away</title>

Abstract: Flocking, as paradigmatically exemplified by birds, is the coherent collective motion of active agents. As originally conceived, flocking emerges through alignment interactions between the agents. Here, we report that flocking can also emerge through interactions that turn agents away from each other. Combining simulations, kinetic theory, and experiments, we demonstrate this mechanism of flocking in self-propelled Janus colloids with stronger repulsion on the front than on the rear. The polar state is stable because particles achieve a compromise between turning away from left and right neighbors. Unlike for alignment interactions, the emergence of polar order from turn-away interactions requires particle repulsion. At high concentration, repulsion produces flocking Wigner crystals. Whereas repulsion often leads to motility-induced phase separation of active particles, here it combines with turn-away torques to produce flocking. Therefore, our findings bridge the classes of aligning and non-aligning active matter. Our results could help to reconcile the observations that cells can flock despite turning away from each other via contact inhibition of locomotion. Overall, our work shows that flocking is a very robust phenomenon that arises even when the orientational interactions would seem to prevent it.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics provide the underlying physical mechanism of the perceptual rivalry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perceptual rivalry, where conflicting sensory information leads to alternating perceptions crucial for associated cognitive function, has attracted researcher's attention for long. Despite progresses being made, recent studies have revealed limitations and inconsistencies in our understanding across various rivalry contexts. We develop a unified physical framework, where perception undergoes a consecutive phase transition process encompassing different multi-state competitions. We reveal the underlying mechanisms of perceptual rivalry by identifying dominant switching paths among perceptual states and quantifying mean perceptual durations, switching frequencies, and proportions of different perceptions. We uncover the underlying nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics by analyzing average nonequilibrium flux and entropy production rate, while associated time series irreversibility reflects the underlying nonequilibrium mechanism of perceptual rivalry and link thermodynamical results with neuro-electrophysiological experiments. Our framework provides a global and physical understanding of brain perception, which may go beyond cognitive science or psychology but embodies the connection with wider fields as decision-making.</description>
