      <title>Torchtree: flexible phylogenetic model development and inference using PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference has predominantly relied on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for many years. However, MCMC is computationally laborious, especially for complex phylogenetic models of time trees. This bottleneck has led to the search for alternatives, such as variational Bayes, which can scale better to large datasets. In this paper, we introduce torchtree, a framework written in Python that allows developers to easily implement rich phylogenetic models and algorithms using a fixed tree topology. One can either use automatic differentiation, or leverage torchtree's plug-in system to compute gradients analytically for model components for which automatic differentiation is slow. We demonstrate that the torchtree variational inference framework performs similarly to BEAST in terms of speed and approximation accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the use of the forward KL divergence as an optimizing criterion for variational inference, which can handle discontinuous and non-differentiable models. Our experiments show that inference using the forward KL divergence tends to be faster per iteration compared to the evidence lower bound (ELBO) criterion, although the ELBO-based inference may converge faster in some cases. Overall, torchtree provides a flexible and efficient framework for phylogenetic model development and inference using PyTorch.</description>

      <title>Beyond classical Hamilton's Rule. State distribution asymmetry and the dynamics of altruism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes relationships between demographic and state-based evolutionary game framework and inclusive fitness and Hamilton's rule. It is shown that the classical Hamilton's rule (counterfactual method) combined with demographic payoff functions, leads to easily testable models. It works well in the case when the roles of donor and receiver are randomly drawn during each interaction event. This is illustrated by the alarm call example. However, we can imagine situations in which role-switching results from some external mechanism. For example, fluxes of individuals between the border and the interior of the habitat, when only border individuals may spot the threat and warn their neighbors. To cover these cases, a new model is extended to the case with explicit dynamics of the role distributions among carriers of different strategies, driven by some general mechanisms. It is thereby shown that even in the case when fluxes between roles are driven by neutral mechanisms acting in the same way on all strategies, differences in mortality in the focal interaction lead to different distributions of roles for different strategies. This leads to a more complex rule for cooperation than the classical Hamilton's rule. In addition to the classical cost and benefit, the new rule contains a third component weighted by the difference in proportions of donors among carriers of both strategies. Depending on the sign, this component can be termed the survival surplus, or the sacrifice cost, when the receiver's survival exceeds that of the donor. For the "surplus" case, cooperators can win even in the case when the assortment mechanism is inefficient (i.e probability of receiving help for noncooperators is slightly greater than for cooperators), which is impossible in the classical Hamilton's rule.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: Range Expansions across Landscapes with Quenched Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When biological populations expand into new territory, the evolutionary outcomes can be strongly influenced by genetic drift, the random fluctuations in allele frequencies. Meanwhile, spatial variability in the environment can also significantly influence the competition between sub-populations vying for space. Little is known about the interplay of these intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise in population dynamics: When does environmental heterogeneity dominate over genetic drift or vice versa, and what distinguishes their population genetics signatures? Here, in the context of neutral evolution, we examine the interplay between a population's intrinsic, demographic noise and an extrinsic, quenched random noise provided by a heterogeneous environment. Using a multi-species Eden model, we simulate a population expanding over a landscape with random variations in local growth rates and measure how this variability affects genealogical tree structure, and thus genetic diversity. We find that, for strong heterogeneity, the genetic makeup of the expansion front is to a great extent predetermined by the set of fastest paths through the environment. The landscape-dependent statistics of these optimal paths then supersede those of the population's intrinsic noise as the main determinant of evolutionary dynamics. Remarkably, the statistics for coalescence of genealogical lineages, derived from those deterministic paths, strongly resemble the statistics emerging from demographic noise alone in uniform landscapes. This cautions interpretations of coalescence statistics and raises new challenges for inferring past population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is a simple, robust, and versatile model used to describe large interacting systems such as food webs or microbiomes. The model consists of $n$ coupled differential equations linking the abundances of $n$ different species. We consider a large random interaction matrix with independent entries and a block variance profile. The $i$th diagonal block represents the intra-community interaction in community $i$, while the off-diagonal blocks represent the inter-community interactions. The variance remains constant within each block, but may vary across blocks.
  We investigate the important case of two communities of interacting species, study how interactions affect their respective equilibrium. We also describe equilibrium with feasibility (i.e., whether there exists an equilibrium with all species at non-zero abundances) and the existence of an attrition phenomenon (some species may vanish) within each community.
  Information about the general case of $b$ communities ($b&gt; 2$) is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Fair game: Urban free-ranging dogs balance resource use and risk aversion at seasonal fairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seasonal fairs, bustling with human activity, provide a unique environment for exploring the intricate interplay between humans and free-ranging dogs. This study investigated these interactions during seasonal fairs in Nadia and Bardhaman districts, West Bengal, India. Across 13 fairground sites, we explore how human footfall and resource availability impact dog behavior, with a particular emphasis on cognitive mechanisms. Data collection occurred from December to March, comprising three sessions - initial, middle, and end, each on three randomly selected days. Employing spot census and scan sampling methods, observers documented GPS locations, sex, and behaviors of free-ranging dogs. Videos captured interactions within the fair environment, revealing cognitive processes. Our analysis revealed a notable increase in human activity during the middle phase, coinciding with a rise in dog abundance. Dogs predominantly foraged, exhibited gait, and remained vigilant, their numbers positively associated with resource availability. Proximity to the fairground significantly shaped dog behavior, indicating cognitive processes in decision-making. Dogs closer to the fair demonstrated consistent behavior, likely due to immediate resource access, implying sophisticated cognitive mapping and resource utilization. Conversely, dogs from farther distances exhibited lower consistency and heightened aggression, intensifying foraging, gait, and vigilance activities, suggesting cognitive adaptations to resource scarcity and competition. These findings underscore the intricate relationship between human activity, resource availability, and the behavior and cognition of free-ranging dogs during seasonal fairs. They offer insights into the ecological dynamics of free-ranging dogs in human-influenced landscapes, emphasizing the necessity for comprehensive management strategies in urban and peri-urban environments.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Simulation Method for Fractional Order Compartment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study focuses on fractional order compartment models derived from underlying physical stochastic processes, providing a more physically grounded approach compared to models that use the dynamical system approach by simply replacing integer-order derivatives with fractional order derivatives. In these models, inherent stochasticity becomes important, particularly when dealing with the dynamics of small populations far from the continuum limit of large particle numbers. The necessity for stochastic simulations arises from deviations of the mean states from those obtained from the governing equations in these scenarios. To address this, we introduce an exact stochastic simulation algorithm designed for fractional order compartment models, based on a semi-Markov process. We have considered a fractional order resusceptibility SIS model and a fractional order recovery SIR model as illustrative examples, highlighting significant disparities between deterministic and stochastic dynamics when the total population is small. Beyond its modeling applications, the algorithm presented serves as a versatile tool for solving fractional order differential equations via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not always supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex and, often, stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. Using a non-linear generalization of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are, in fact, two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing.</description>
