      <title>Host-dependent frequency offsets in $^{229}$Th nuclear clockwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in laser excitation of the low-energy nuclear isomer transition in $^{229}$Th have opened avenues for developing nuclear clocks, a novel quantum technology with exceptional performance and sensitivity to exotic physics. Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}($$^{229}$Th$^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}{3+})= 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.</description>

      <title>The Land$\acute{e}$ $g$ factors for the $6S_{1/2}$ , $5D_{3/2,5/2}$ states of Ba$^{+}$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Land$\acute{e}$ $g$ factors of Ba$^+$ are very important in high-precision measurement physics. The wave functions, energy levels, and Land$\acute{e}$ $g$ factors for the $6s$ $^{2}S_{1/2}$ and $5d$ $^{2}D_{3/2,5/2}$ states of Ba$^{+}$ ions were calculated using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method and the Model-QED method. The contributions of the electron correlation effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects were discussed in detail. The transition energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, with differences of approximately 5 cm$^{-1}$. The presently calculated $g$ factor of 2.0024905(16) for the $6S_{1/2}$ agrees very well with the available experimental and theoretical results, with a difference at a level of 10$^{-6}$. For the $5D_{3/2, 5/2}$ states, the present results of 0.7993961(126) and 1.2003942(190) agree with the experimental results of 0.7993278(3) [\textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. A 54, 1199(1996)}] and 1.20036739(14) [\textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 193001 (2020)}] very well, with differences at the level of 10$^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>New beyond-Voigt line-shape profile recommended for the HITRAN database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameters associated with the collisional perturbation of spectral lines are essential for modeling the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in gas media. The HITRAN molecular spectroscopic database provides these parameters, although originally they were associated only with the Voigt profile parameterization. However, in the HITRAN2016 and HITRAN2020 editions, Voigt, speed-dependent Voigt and Hartmann-Tran (HT) profiles have been incorporated, thanks to the new relational structure of the database. The HT profile was introduced in HITRAN in 2016 as a recommended profile for the most accurate spectral interpretations and modeling. It was parameterized with a four-temperature-range temperature dependence. Since then, however, some features of the HT profile have been revealed that are problematic from a practical perspective. These are: the singular behavior of the temperature dependencies of the velocity-changing parameters when the shift parameter crosses zero and the difficulty in evaluating the former for mixtures. In this article, we summarize efforts to eliminate the above-mentioned problems that led us to recommend using the quadratic speed-dependent hard-collision (qSDHC) profile with double-power-law (DPL) temperature dependencies. We refer to this profile as a modified Hartmann-Tran (mHT) profile. The computational cost of evaluating it is the same as for the HT profile. We give a detailed description of the mHT profile (also including line mixing) and discuss the representation of its parameters, together with their DPL temperature parametrization adopted in the HITRAN database. We discuss an efficient algorithm for evaluating this profile and provide corresponding computer codes in several programming languages: Fortran, Python, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, and LabVIEW. We also discuss the associated update of the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI).</description>

      <title>DiPolMol-Py: A Python package for calculations for $^2\Sigma$ ground-state molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the python package DiPolMol-Py, which can be used to calculate the rotational and hyperfine structure of $^2\Sigma$ molecules. The calculations can be performed in the presence of dc magnetic fields, dc electric fields and far off-resonant optical fields. We additionally include functions to calculate the polarisability of the molecule and the transition dipole moment between different energy eigenstates. The package is applicable to many of the molecules which can be laser cooled, specifically the alkaline earth fluorides. We provide a constants file which includes many of the required literature values for CaF, SrF and BaF. Additional species can easily be added by updating this file.</description>

      <title>Global isotopic analysis of rotational spectroscopic data for barium monofluoride, BaF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New high-precision microwave spectroscopic measurements and analysis of rotational energy level transitions in the ground vibronic state of the open-shell BaF molecule are reported with the purpose of contributing to studies of physics beyond the Standard Model. BaF is currently among the key candidate molecules being examined in the searches for a measurable electron electric dipole moment, eEDM, as well as the nuclear anapole moment. Employing Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy, these new pure rotational transition frequencies for the 138Ba19F, 137Ba19F, 136Ba19F, 135Ba19F, and 134Ba19F isotopologues are analyzed here in a combined global fit with previous microwave data sets for 138Ba19F (v = 0 - 4), 137Ba19F, and 136Ba19F using the program SPFIT. As a result, hyperfine parameters are significantly improved, and we observe a distinctive structure in a Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) analysis of the primary rotational constant. This can be understood using the nuclear field shifts due to the known isotopic variation in the size of barium nuclei and in combination with the smaller linear mass-dependent BOB terms.</description>

      <title>Low-noise environment for probing fundamental symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules. To minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic electric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external magnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer mu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial direction and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the difference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between sections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field inside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and above, rising to 500 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical studies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline is maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric field of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below 1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the direction of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104 hours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for measuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The design principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly applicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in molecules, atoms, and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Collective emission and selective-radiance in atomic clouds and arrays coupled to a microring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collective dipole-dipole interactions in atoms coupled to a nanophotonic microring resonator. The atoms can interact with each other through light-induced dipole-dipole interactions mediated by free space and through the resonator whispering-gallery modes. The differing characteristics and mismatched wavenumbers of these modes give rise to complex dynamics and provide new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions. We explore these phenomena in the context of an experimentally realized atom cloud and study the potential of the proposed sub-wavelength atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>

      <title>Mutual friction and vortex Hall angle in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantized vortex is intimately connected with its microscopic structure and the elementary excitations of the surrounding fluid. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional motion of a single vortex orbiting a pinned anti-vortex in a unitary Fermi superfluid at varying temperature. By analyzing its trajectory, we measure the yet-unknown longitudinal and transverse mutual friction coefficients, which quantify the vortex-mediated coupling between the normal and superfluid components. Both coefficients increase while approaching the superfluid transition. They provide access to the vortex Hall angle, which is linked to the relaxation time of the localized quasiparticles occupying Andreev bound states within the vortex core, as well as the intrinsic superfluid parameter associated with the transition from laminar to quantum turbulent flows. We compare our results with numerical simulations and an analytic model originally formulated for superfluid $^3$He in the low-temperature limit, finding good agreement. Our work highlights the interplay between vortex-bound quasiparticles and delocalized thermal excitations in shaping vortex dynamics in unitary Fermi superfluids. Further, it provides a novel testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium vortex matter at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Precise charge state distribution of projectile ions through solid targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charge state distribution (CSD) of the projectile ions through solid targets in the intermediate energy range (1 MeV/u $&lt;$ E $&lt;$ 4 MeV/u) has a major impact on the collision of the ion atom and accelerator physics. We explore the mean charge states taken from the empirical formula [Schiwietz $et~al.$, Nucl. Inst. Meths. {\bf 225}, 4(2004)] are only good for projectile ions with $Z_1 \le 16$. To solve this issue, we develop a model in which instead of a single formula, if we employ four formulae, the comparative picture between experimental and empirical data becomes impressive. Furthermore, the CSDs with the mean charge state so obtained and the Gaussian distribution function having distribution width given by [Novikov and Teplove, Phys. Lett. {\bf378}, 1286(2014)] compare well with the experimentally measured CSDs for the entire range of projectile ions. We believe that precise CSDs will be highly useful in both ion-atom collision and accelerator physics.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Subharmonics of the Electron Emission from Ultracold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena in the ultracold plasmas are multiple subharmonics of the electron emission observed after its irradiation by the monochromatic radiowaves. Unfortunately, the early interpretation of this phenomenon as the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances (i.e., actually the standing Langmuir waves) encountered a number of serious obstacles, such as a lack of the adequate boundary conditions, an incorrect dependence on the electron temperature, and an insensitivity to the shape of the cloud. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the quasi-classical multiphoton ionization of the 'secondary' Rydberg atoms formed in the expanding and cooling plasma clouds. As follows from our numerical simulations, the efficiency of such ionization exhibits a series of well-expressed peaks. Moreover, this process is evidently irrelevant to the boundary conditions and global shape of the cloud. Therefore, this should be a viable alternative to the earlier idea of Tonks--Dattner resonances.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Influence of the laser pulse duration in high-order harmonic generation</title>

Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been studied for almost 40 years in many different conditions, varying the laser wavelength, intensity, focusing geometry, target design, gas species, etc. However, no systematic investigation of the effect of the pulse duration has been performed in spite of its expected impact on phase-matching of the high-order harmonics. Here, we develop a compact post-compression method based on a bulk multi-pass cell enabling tunable Fourier-limited pulse durations. We examine the HHG yield as a function of the pulse duration, ranging from 42 fs to 180 fs, while maintaining identical focusing conditions and generating medium. Our findings reveal that, for a given intensity, there exists an optimum pulse duration - not necessarily the shortest - that maximizes conversion efficiency. This optimum pulse duration increases as the intensity decreases. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical simulations, which show the dependence of HHG yield on the duration and peak intensity of the driving laser and underscore the importance of the interplay between light-matter interaction and phase-matching in the non-linear medium. Our conclusion explains why HHG could be demonstrated in 1988 with pulses as long as 40 ps and intensities of just a few $10^{13}$ W/cm${^2}$.</description>
