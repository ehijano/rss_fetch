      <title>Turbulent diffusion and dispersion in a superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-body diffusion and two-body dispersion are fundamental processes in classical turbulence, governing particle mixing and transport. However, their behaviors in superfluid turbulence remain largely unexplored. In this study, we numerically investigate the diffusion and relative dispersion of quantized vortices and superfluid parcels in the 0 K limit in two distinct turbulence regimes: ultra-quantum turbulence, characterized by a randomized vortex tangle, and quasiclassical turbulence, in which locally polarized vortices create large-scale flows resembling classical turbulence. Our results reveal that while vortex segments exhibit similar superdiffusion behavior at short times in both regimes, superfluid parcels behave differently: following the same superdiffusion scaling in ultra-quantum turbulence but deviating significantly in quasiclassical turbulence. This contrast provides a key clue to the origin of short-time superdiffusion, a puzzle since its recent discovery. Additionally, we show that two-body dispersion of both vortex segments and superfluid parcels exhibits distinct scaling behaviors in ultra-quantum and quasiclassical turbulence, highlighting fundamental differences in these two turbulence regimes. Our findings bridge a critical gap in superfluid turbulence research, offering new insights into turbulent transport in inviscid quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of Bose Gas: effect of external trapping and three-body interaction with Gross-Pitaevskii equation in Tonks-Girardeau regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the stability aspects of quintic Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with the presence and absence of external trapping potential for a Bose Gas (BG) in both the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) and the super Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) regimes. For this purpose, we compute both analytically and numerically a pure quintic GP equation with the presence of the scattering lengths. Using the time-dependent variational approach, we derive the equations of motion and effective potential of the system for both cases. Through the effective potential, we discuss the stability properties of pure quintic GP equation and obtain the modulational instability condition of BECs. The variational results are verified by means of direct numerical simulations using split-step Crank-Nicolson method and the observed results are in agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Bose ladder with extended range density-density interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When hard-core bosons on a two-leg ladder get frustrated by ring exchange interactions, the elusive d-wave Bose liquid (DBL) can be stabilized, a bosonic analog of a correlated metal. Here, we analyze the effect of extended Hubbard interactions on the DBL phase. Strikingly, these interactions are found to act in favor of the exotic Bose liquid. This observation is of immediate relevance for physical systems in which non-local exchange processes occur as a consequence of extended-range density-density interactions. Our observation also helps to achieve DBL physics in a synthetic-dimension ladder, where on-site interactions translate into non-local interactions along a synthetic rung. In this context, we also consider the extreme limit, in which the local hardcore constraint is elevated to an effective rung blockade. In addition to the enhancement of DBL physics due to extended-range density-density interactions, we also find signatures of an interesting intermediate phase between the superfluid and the DBL regime. This phase, labeled as the density modulated s-wave paired (DMSP) phase, combines features of density wave and s-wave pairing. Our results offer new insights into the physics of frustrated bosons by highlighting the influence of density-density interaction and rung-blockade.</description>

      <title>Interaction Quench Dynamics and Stability of Quantum Vortices in Rotating Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum vortices in a two-dimensional rotating Bose-Einstein condensate following an interaction quench. Using an ab initio and numerically exact quantum many-body approach, we systematically tune the interplay between interaction strength and angular velocity to prepare quantum vortices in various configurations and examine their post-quench dynamics. Our study reveals distinct dynamical regimes: First, vortex distortion accompanied by density cloud fragmentation, matching the initial vortex number and second, vortex revival, where fragmented densities interact and merge. Notably, we observe complete vortex revival dynamics in the single-vortex case, pseudo-revival in double and triple vortex configurations, and chaotic many-body dynamics in systems with multiple vortices. Our results reveal a universal out-of-equilibrium response of quantum vortices to interaction quenches, highlighting the importance of many-body effects with a possible exploration in quantum simulation with ultracold quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>The ideal gas of Bosons and Fermions in Harmonic Traps in the framework of Extended Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript studies harmonically trapped ideal Bose and Fermi gas systems and their thermodynamics in the framework of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). In particular, we demonstrated how the ground and thermal particle ratios, condensate temperature, internal energy, specific heat, and equation of state functions change in the EUP formalism. Following a comprehensive analysis, we concluded that the effect of the EUP on ideal Bose and Fermi gas systems remains relatively modest compared to the effect of the Gravitational (Generalised) Uncertainty Principle. { By comparing the obtained results with experimental data, we found that the EUP parameter is bounded as $\alpha \leq 0.36654\times 10^{7}\text{ \ }m^{-2}$.}</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Bistability of Fermionic Atoms Coupled to a Dissipative Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state phase diagram of fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluid helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid $^3$He over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ - ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) - extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P$-$T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D / \xi_0 = 1$ , where $D = 80$ nm. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.</description>

      <title>Degeneracies In a Weighted Sum of Two Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Universality of a Squeezing Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</description>
