      <title>Middle convolutions of KZ-type equations and single-elimination tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the generalized Riemann scheme for Fuchsian ordinary differential equations in the case of KZ-type equations. This extension describes the local structure of equations obtained by resolving the singularities of KZ-type equations. We present the transformation of this extension under middle convolutions. As a consequence, we derive the corresponding transformation of the eigenvalues and multiplicities of the residue matrices of KZ-type equations under middle convolutions. We interpret the result in terms of the combinatorics of single-elimination tournaments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of fractional integral operators defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose kernels are distributions associated with Zygmund dilations: $(x_1, x_2, x_3) \rightarrow (\delta_1 x_1, \delta_2 x_2, \delta_1\delta_2 x_3)$ for $\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0$ having singularity on every coordinate subspace. As a result, we obtain a Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type inequality.</description>

      <title>Full asymptotic expansions of the Humbert function $\Phi_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive full asymptotic expansions for the Humbert function $\Phi_1$ in different limiting regimes of its variables. Our derivation employs various asymptotic methods and relies on key transformation formulae established by Erd\'elyi (1940), and Tuan and Kalla (1987). The efficiency of our asymptotic results are also illustrated through two applications: (1) analytic continuations of Saran's function $F_M$, and (2) two limits arising in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. Finally, some promising directions for future research are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Removable Sets for Fractional Heat and Fractional Bessel-Heat Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the fractional heat diffusion equations $L_{\gamma,a}:=(-\Delta_a)^{\frac{\gamma}{2}}+\partial_t$, where $\Delta_a$ is the Laplace- or the Bessel-Laplace operator. We give conditions for removability which are sufficient and which are necessary, by $L^p$-capacities. Introducing a spherical modulus of smoothness we can treat the Laplace and Bessel-Laplace cases together.</description>

      <title>Hardy spaces and Campanato spaces associated with Laguerre expansions and higher order Riesz transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{L}_\nu\) be the Laguerre differential operator which is the self-adjoint extension of the differential operator \[ L_\nu := \sum_{i=1}^n \left[-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2} + x_i^2 + \frac{1}{x_i^2} \left(\nu_i^2 - \frac{1}{4} \right) \right] \] initially defined on \(C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}_+^n)\) as its natural domain, where \(\nu \in [-1/2,\infty)^n\), \(n \geq 1\). In this paper, we first develop the theory of Hardy spaces \(H^p_{\mathcal{L}_\nu}\) associated with \(\mathcal{L}_\nu\) for the full range \(p \in (0,1]\). Then we investigate the corresponding BMO-type spaces and establish that they coincide with the dual spaces of \(H^p_{\mathcal{L}_\nu}\). Finally, we show boundedness of higher-order Riesz transforms on Lebesgue spaces, as well as on our new Hardy and BMO-type spaces.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Theory for a Class of Periodic Superlinear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze, mainly using bifurcation methods, an elliptic superlinear problem in one-dimension with periodic boundary conditions. One of the main novelties is that we follow for the first time a bifurcation approach, relying on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and some recent global bifurcation results, that allows us to study the local and global structure of non-trivial solutions at bifurcation points where the linearized operator has a two-dimensional kernel. Indeed, at such points the classical tools in bifurcation theory, like the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem or some generalizations of it, cannot be applied because the multiplicity of the eigenvalues is not odd, and a new approach is required. We apply this analysis to specific examples, obtaining new existence and multiplicity results for the considered periodic problems, going beyond the information variational and fixed point methods like Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem can provide.</description>

      <title>A direct and algebraic characterization of higher-order differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an algebraic approach to characterizing higher-order differential operators. While the foundational Leibniz rule addresses first-order derivatives, its extension to higher orders typically involves identities relating multiple distinct operators. In contrast, we introduce a novel operator equation involving only a single $n$\textsuperscript{th}-order differential operator. We demonstrate that, under certain mild conditions, this equation serves to characterize such operators. Specifically, our results show that these higher-order differential operators can be identified as particular solutions to this single-operator identity. This approach provides a framework for understanding the algebraic structure of higher-order differential operators acting on function spaces.</description>

      <title>Counting integral points near space curves: an elementary approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish upper and lower bounds for the number of integral points which lie within a neighbourhood of a smooth nondegenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$. These estimates are new for $n\geq 4$, and we recover an earlier result of J. J. Huang for $n=3$. However, we do so by using Fourier analytic techniques which, in contrast with the method of Huang, do not require the sharp counting result for planar curves as an input. In particular, we rely on an Arkhipov--Chubarikov--Karatsuba-type oscillatory integral estimate.</description>

      <title>The Whitney method of fundamental solutions with Lusin wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation for a variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), where the source points $\{q_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ accumulate towards the domain in a Whitney fashion, meaning that their separation is proportional to the distance to the domain. We prove that the normalized Lusin wavelets $\psi_j(w) = b_j(w-q_j)^{-2}$ constitute a generalized basis, known as a frame, for the Hardy subspace of $L_2$-traces of holomorphic functions on the domain. Consequently, our method, where $\psi_j$ are used as basis functions in the MFS, enables a numerically stable approximation of solutions to Laplace boundary value problems, even when the solutions lack analytic continuation across the boundary. Despite the source points accumulating towards the domain, our computations show no loss of accuracy near the boundary, in contrast to the boundary integral equation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish optimal convergence rates for the P1 finite element approximation of the Sobolev constant in arbitrary dimensions N\geq 2 and for Lebesgue exponents 1&lt;p&lt;N. Our analysis relies on a refined study of the Sobolev deficit in suitable quasi-norms, which have been introduced and utilized in the context of finite element approximations of the p- Laplacian. The proof further involves sharp estimates for the finite element approximation of Sobolev minimizers.</description>

Abstract: We study certain overlap coefficients appearing in representation theory of the quantum algebra $\U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\C))$. The overlap coefficients can be identified as products of Askey-Wilson functions, leading to an algebraic interpretation of the multivariate Askey-Wilson functions introduced by Geronimo and Iliev. We use the underlying coalgebra structure to derive $q$-difference equations satisfied by the multivariate Askey-Wilson functions.</description>

      <title>Exact Parameter Identification in PET Pharmacokinetic Modeling: Extension to the Reversible Two Tissue Compartment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of recovering tracer kinetic parameters from multi-region measurement data in quantitative PET imaging using the reversible two tissue compartment model. Its main result is an extension of our previous work on the irreversible two tissue compartment model. In analogy to our previous work, we show that also in the (practically highly relevant) reversible case, most tracer kinetic parameters can be uniquely identified from standard PET measurements (without additional full blood sample analysis that is usually performed in practice) and under reasonable assumptions. In addition, unique identifiability of all parameters is shown provided that additional measurements from the (uncorrected) total arterial blood tracer concentration (which can be obtained from standard PET measurements or from a simple blood sample analysis) are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global (asymptotic) stability of the Lengyel-Epstein differential systems, sometimes called Belousov-Zhabotinsky differential systems. Such systems are topologically equivalent to a two-parameter family of cubic systems in the plane. We show that for each pair of admissible parameters the unique equilibrium point of the corresponding system is not globally (asymptotically) stable. On the other hand, we provide explicit conditions for this unique equilibrium point to be asymptotically stable and we study its basin of attraction. We also study the generic and degenerate Hopf bifurcations and highlight a subset of the set of admissible parameters for which the phase portraits of the systems have two limit cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new type of convergent, and asymptotic, representations, dyadic expansions. Their convergence is geometric and the region of convergence often extends from infinity down to $0^+$. We show that dyadic expansions are numerically efficient representations. For special functions such as Bessel, Airy, Ei, erfc, Gamma, etc. the region of convergence of dyadic series is the complex plane minus a ray, with this cut chosen at will. Dyadic expansions thus provide uniform, geometrically convergent asymptotic expansions including near antistokes rays. We prove that relatively general functions, \'Ecalle resurgent ones, possess convergent dyadic expansions. These expansions extend to operators, resulting in representations of the resolvent of self-adjoint operators as series in terms of the associated unitary evolution operator evaluated at some prescribed discrete times (alternatively, for positive operators, in terms of the generated semigroup).</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas--Its--Kitaev Riemann--Hilbert problem using the Deift--Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\overline \partial$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that are slightly improved while less regular perturbations are admissible. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be twice differentiable, with bounded third derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative necessary and sufficient condition for a spiral arc to be a H\"older arc. The class of spiral arcs contains the polynomial spirals studied by Fraser, and the elliptical spirals studied by Burrell-Falconer-Fraser. As an application, we recover the sharp result on the H\"older winding problem for polynomial spirals. Moreover, we provide a sharp exponent estimate for the H\"older classification of polynomial spirals, which coincides with the corresponding quasiconformal classification estimate, and improve certain exponent bounds of Burrell-Falconer-Fraser on the H\"older classification of elliptical spirals.</description>

      <title>Stokes shells and Fourier transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.01037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules on a complex line are classified by the associated topological data consisting of local systems with Stokes structure and the nearby and vanishing cycles at the singularities. The Fourier transform for algebraic holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-modules is defined by exchanging the roles of the variable and the derivative. It is interesting to study the induced transform for the associated topological data. In particular, we closely study the local system with Stokes structure at infinity of the Fourier transform of a $\mathcal{D}$-module, which also allows us to describe the remaining data. We introduce explicit algebraic operations for local systems with Stokes structure, called the local Fourier transform, to study the case of the $\mathcal{D}$-modules associated with basic meromorphic flat bundles. The properties of the local Fourier transforms are captured in terms of Stokes shells. We also introduce the notion of extensions to study the general case.</description>

      <title>Brennan's conjecture holds for semigroups of holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present note, we give a short proof of Brennan's conjecture in the special case of continuous semigroups of holomorphic functions. We apply classical techniques of complex analysis in conjunction with recent results on B\'{e}koll\'{e}-Bonami weights and spectra of integration operators.</description>

      <title>Lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on unbounded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces, and, in particular, on all convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces. In order to do this, we also obtain log-scale lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on manifolds of uniformly bounded geometry with nonpositive and negative sectional curvatures, extending the recent works of the first two authors for compact manifolds. We are able to use these along with known $L^2$-local smoothing and new $L^2 \to L^q$ half-localized resolvent estimates to obtain our lossless bounds.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>
