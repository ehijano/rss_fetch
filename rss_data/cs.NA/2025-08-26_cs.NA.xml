      <title>Walk-on-Interfaces: A Monte Carlo Estimator for an Elliptic Interface Problem with Nonhomogeneous Flux Jump Conditions and a Neumann Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic interface problems arise in numerous scientific and engineering applications, modeling heterogeneous materials in which physical properties change discontinuously across interfaces. In this paper, we present \textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a class of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump conditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout the domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source evaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification with reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be performed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of the Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we use our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that outputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our solution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our estimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize naturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that have irregular geometry and in up to dimension six. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to highlight its potential in solving problems motivated by real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Harmonic potentials in the de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing vector fields by scalar or vector potentials can be a challenging task in domains with cavities or tunnels, due to the presence of harmonic fields which are both irrotational and solenoidal but may have no scalar or vector potentials. For harmonic fields normal to the boundary, which can exist in domains with cavities, it is possible to define scalar potentials with Dirichlet boundary conditions fitted to the domain's cavities. For harmonic fields tangent to the boundary, which can exist in domains with tunnels, a similar construction was lacking. In this article we present a construction of vector potentials that yield a basis for the tangent harmonic fields. Our vector potentials are obtained by solving curl-curl problems with inhomogeneous tangent boundary conditions that are fitted to closed curves looping around the tunnels. Applied to structure-preserving finite elements, our method also provides an exact geometric parametrization of the discrete harmonic fields.</description>

      <title>Enhanced shape recovery in advection--diffusion problems via a novel ADMM-based CCBM optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel shape optimization framework for geometric inverse problems governed by the advection-diffusion equation, based on the coupled complex boundary method (CCBM). Building on recent developments [2, 45, 46, 47, 51], we aim to recover the shape of an unknown inclusion via shape optimization driven by a cost functional constructed from the imaginary part of the complex-valued state variable over the entire domain. We rigorously derive the associated shape derivative in variational form and provide explicit expressions for the gradient and second-order information. Optimization is carried out using a Sobolev gradient method within a finite element framework. To address difficulties in reconstructing obstacles with concave boundaries, particularly under measurement noise and the combined effects of advection and diffusion, we introduce a numerical scheme inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). In addition to implementing this non-conventional approach, we demonstrate how the adjoint method can be efficiently applied and utilize partial gradients to develop a more efficient CCBM-ADMM scheme. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed computational approach are validated through various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for Computing the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse of Quaternion Matrices, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop iterative methods to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of quaternion matrices directly in $\mathbb{H}$. We introduce a damped Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration, proving its convergence under spectral scaling $X_0=\alpha A^H$ with $\alpha\in(0,2/\|A\|_2^2)$. We derive higher-order hyperpower NS schemes with optimized factorizations. Beyond NS, we propose a randomized sketch-and-project method (RSP-Q) and a conjugate gradient on normal equations (CGNE-Q). Numerically, spectrally-scaled NS achieves superior accuracy and runtime. In applications (image completion, filtering, deblurring), the NS family delivers state-of-the-art performance with the lowest wall time, providing efficient solvers for large-scale quaternion inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for multi-material elasticity problems in electronic packaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) method for analyzing elasticity problems in electronic packaging multi-material structures. The core innovation lies in replacing Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the energy-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework. The method constructs admissible displacement fields that automatically satisfy essential boundary conditions and employs various numerical integration schemes to compute loss functions for network optimization. Unlike traditional PINNs that require domain decomposition and penalty terms for multi-material problems, KANs' trainable B-spline activation functions provide inherent piecewise function characteristics that naturally accommodate material property discontinuities. Consequently, this approach requires only a single KAN to achieve accurate approximation across the entire computational domain without subdomain partitioning and interface continuity constraints. Numerical validation demonstrates PIKAN's accuracy and robustness for multi-material elasticity problems. The method maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to domain decomposition approaches. Results confirm PIKAN's unique advantages in solving multi-material problems and its significant potential for electronic packaging structure analysis.

      <title>An implicit-explicit BDF-Galerkin scheme of second order for the nonlinear thermistor problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes an implicit-explicit BDF-Galerkin scheme of second order for the time-dependent nonlinear thermistor problem. For this, we combine the second-order backward differentiation formula with special extrapolation terms for time discretization with standard finite elements for spatial discretization. Unconditionally superclose and superconvergent error estimates are established, relying on two key techniques. First, a time-discrete system is introduced to decompose the error function into its temporal and spatial components. Second, superclose error estimates between the numerical solution and the interpolation of the time-discrete solution are employed to effectively handle the nonlinear coupling term. Finally, we present numerical examples that validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the unconditional stability and the second-order accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of structured Bohemian matrices and their Inner and Outer Bohemian Inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically define and characterize various classes of Bohemian matrices with respect to the population $\mathbb{P}=\{0, \pm 1\}$, focusing on their inner and outer Bohemian inverses. The classes under consideration include rank-one Bohemian matrices, as well as higher-rank Bohemian matrix classes, specifically Classes I, II, and III. For rank-one Bohemian matrices, a complete description of the outer Bohemian inverse sets is provided along with their cardinalities. Additionally, new insights into inner Bohemian inverses and their cardinalities are given. Characterizations of the complete set of inner inverses for the Class III matrices and full-row rank Class II matrices are obtained. Furthermore, we study the sets of rank-one outer inverses for Classes I and II, and examine the sets of rank $r$ outer inverses for full-row rank Class II matrices of rank $r$. Moreover, the set of outer inverses is completely characterized for rank-two full-row rank Class III matrices. In particular, we provide an explicit formula for the cardinality of the set of outer Bohemian inverses for rank-two full-row rank Class I matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a few new properties of Active Flux (AF)/Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted (PAMPA) schemes. First, we show, in full generality, that the Active Flux (AF)/Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted (PAMPA) schemes can be interpreted in such a way that the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) scheme is one of their building blocks. Secondly we provide some intrinsic bound preserving properties. This is also illustrated numericaly. Last, we show, at least in one dimension, that the PAMPA scheme has the Summation by part property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.</description>

      <title>A Relaxed Step-Ratio Constraint for Time-Fractional Cahn--Hilliard Equations: Analysis and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of time-fractional differential equations encounter significant challenges arising from solution singularities at the initial time. To address this issue, the construction of nonuniform temporal meshes satisfying $\tau_k/\tau_{k-1} \geq 1$ has emerged as an effective strategy, where $\tau_k$ represents the $k$-th time-step size. For the time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equation, Liao et al.~[\textit{IMA J. Numer. Anal.}, \textbf{45} (2025), 1425--1454] developed an analytical framework using a variable-step L2 formula with the constraint $0.3960 \leq \tau_k/\tau_{k-1} \leq r^*(\alpha)$, where $r^*(\alpha) \geq 4.660$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$. The present work makes substantial theoretical progress by introducing innovative splitting techniques that relax the step-size ratio restriction to $\tau_k/\tau_{k-1} \leq \rho^*(\alpha)$, with $\rho^*(\alpha) &gt; \overline{\rho} \approx 4.7476114$. This advancement provides significantly greater flexibility in time-step selection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a refined L2-type temporal approximation coupled with a fourth-order compact difference spatial discretization, yielding an efficient numerical scheme for the time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard problem. Our rigorous analysis establishes the scheme's fundamental properties, including unique solvability, exact discrete volume conservation, proper energy dissipation laws, and optimal convergence rates. For practical implementation, we construct a specialized nonuniform mesh that automatically satisfies the relaxed constraint $\rho^*(\alpha) &gt; 4.7476114$.</description>

      <title>A Variable-Separation-based Domain Decomposition Method for Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model order reduction method for a class of parametric dynamical systems. Using a temporal Fourier integral transform, we reformulate these systems into complex-valued elliptic equations in the frequency domain, containing both the frequency variables and the parameters inherited from the original model. To reduce the computational cost of the frequency-variable elliptic equations, we extend the variable-separation-based domain decomposition method to the complex-valued context, resulting in an offline-online procedure for solving the parametric dynamical systems. In the offline stage, separate representations of the solutions for the interface problem and the subproblems are constructed. In the online stage for new parameter values, the solutions of the parametric dynamical systems can be directly derived by utilizing the separate representations and implementing the inverse Fourier transform. The proposed approach is capable of being highly efficient because the online stage is independent of the spatial discretization. Finally, we present three specific instances for parametric dynamical systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Solving advection equations with reduction multigrids on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for solving hyperbolic systems typically depend on unknown ordering (e.g., Gauss-Seidel, or sweep/wavefront/marching methods) to achieve good convergence. For many discretisations, mesh types or decompositions these methods do not scale well in parallel. In this work we demonstrate that the combination of AIRG (a reduction multigrid which uses GMRES polynomials) and PMISR DDC (a CF splitting algorithm which gives diagonally dominant submatrices) can be used to solve linear advection equations in parallel on GPUs with good weak scaling. We find that GMRES polynomials are well suited to GPUs when applied matrix-free, either as smoothers (at low order) or as an approximate coarse grid solver (at high order). To improve the parallel performance we automatically truncate the multigrid hierarchy given the quality of the polynomials as coarse grid solvers. Solving time-independent advection equations in 2D on structured grids, we find 66-101% weak scaling efficiency in the solve and 47-63% in the setup with AIRG, across the majority of Lumi-G, a pre-exascale GPU machine.</description>

      <title>A convergence framework for energy minimisation of linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs in nonlinear approximation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of nonlinear methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). While these approaches often perform well in practice, their theoretical analysis remains limited, especially regarding convergence guarantees. This work develops a general optimisation framework for energy minimisation problems arising from linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs, formulated over nonlinear but analytically tractable approximation spaces. The framework accommodates a natural split between linear and nonlinear parameters and supports hybrid optimisation strategies: linear variables are updated via linear solves or steepest descent, while nonlinear variables are handled using constrained projected descent. We establish both local and global convergence of the resulting algorithm under modular structural assumptions on the discrete energy functional, including differentiability, boundedness, regularity, and directional convexity. These assumptions are stated in an abstract form, allowing the framework to apply to a broad class of nonlinear approximation manifolds. In a companion paper, we introduce a concrete instance of such a space based on overlapping free-knot tensor-product B-splines, which satisfies the required assumptions and enables geometrically adaptive solvers with rigorous convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Energy minimisation using overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately solving PDEs with localised features requires refined meshes that adapt to the solution. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite elements, are linear in nature and often ineffective for such problems, as the mesh is not tailored to the solution. Adaptive strategies, such as $h$- and $p$-refinement, improve efficiency by sequentially refining the mesh based on a posteriori error estimates. However, these methods are geometrically rigid -- limited to specific refinement rules -- and require solving the problem on a sequence of adaptive meshes, which can be computationally expensive. Moreover, the design of effective a posteriori error estimates is problem-dependent and non-trivial. In this work, we study a specific nonlinear approximation scheme based on overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-spline patches, where knot positions act as nonlinear parameters controlling the geometry of the discretisation. We analyse the corresponding energy minimisation problem for linear, self-adjoint elliptic PDEs, showing that, under a mild mesh size condition, the discrete energy satisfies the structural properties required for the local and global convergence of the constrained optimisation scheme developed in our companion work [Magueresse, Badia, arXiv (2025)]. This establishes a direct connection between the two analyses: the adaptive free-knot B-spline space considered here fits into the abstract framework, ensuring convergence of projected gradient descent for the joint optimisation of knot positions and coefficients. Numerical experiments illustrate the method's efficiency and its ability to capture localised features with significantly fewer degrees of freedom than standard finite element discretisations.</description>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are becoming a popular method for solving PDEs, due to their mesh-free nature and their ability to handle high-dimensional problems where traditional numerical solvers often struggle. Despite their promise, the practical application of PINNs is still constrained by several fac- tors, a primary one being their often-limited accuracy. This paper is dedicated to enhancing the accuracy of PINNs by introducing spectral-prior guided multistage strategy. We propose two methods: Spectrum- Informed Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SI-MSPINNs) and Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Spectrum Weighted Random Fourier Features (RFF-MSPINNs). The SI-MSPINNs integrate the core mechanism of Spectrum-Informed Multistage Neural Network (SI-MSNNs) and PINNs, in which we extract the Dominant Spectral Pattern (DSP) of residuals by the discrete Fourier transform. This DSP guides the network initialization to alleviate spectral bias, and gradually optimizes the resolution accuracy using a multistage strategy. The RFF-MSPINNs combines random Fourier features with spectral weighting methods, dynamically adjusting the frequency sampling distribution based on the residual power spectral density, allowing the network to prioritize learning high-energy physical modes. Through experimental verification of the Burgers equation and the Helmholtz equation, we show that both models significantly improve the accuracy of the original PINNs.</description>

      <title>Parallel Nodal Interior-Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for the Subsonic Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations: Applications to Vortical Flows and VIV Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes system, designed for applications of technological and industrial interest in the subsonic region. More precisely, this work aims to exploit the DG-discretised Navier-Stokes for two dimensional vortex-induced vibration (VIV) problems allowing for high-order of accuracy. The numerical discretisation comprises a nodal DG method on triangular grids, that includes two types of numerical fluxes: 1) the Roe approximate Riemann solver flux for non-linear advection terms, and 2) an Interior-Penalty numerical flux for non-linear diffusion terms. The nodal formulation permits the use of high order polynomial approximations without compromising computational robustness. The spatially-discrete form is integrated in time using a low-storage strong-stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, and is coupled weakly with an implicit rigid body dynamics algorithm. The proposed algorithm successfully implements polynomial orders of $p\ge 4$ for the laminar compressible Navier-Stokes equations in massively parallel architectures. The resulting framework is firstly tested in terms of its convergence properties. Then, numerical solutions are validated with experimental and numerical data for the case of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds number, and lastly, the methodology is employed to simulate the problem of an elastically-mounted cylinder, a known configuration characterised by significant computational challenges. The above results showcase that the DG framework can be employed as an accurate and efficient, arbitrary order numerical methodology, for high fidelity fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) problems.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Regularization and Learning Methods for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes evolve around mathematical concepts arising in inverse problems. We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval. This then leads us to the framework of well-posedness and first considerations regarding reconstruction and inversion approaches. The second chapter then first deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert spaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of convergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the question of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly focus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional spaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which allow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach. The intersection between inverse problems and machine learning is a rapidly growing field and our exposition here restricts itself to a very limited selection of topics. Among them are learned regularization, fully-learned Bayesian estimation, post-processing strategies and plug-n-play methods.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Parabolic Time-Varying PDEs using Certified Reduced-Order Receding Horizon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the stabilization of linear, time-varying parabolic PDEs using finite-dimensional receding horizon controls (RHCs) derived from reduced-order models (ROMs). We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for exponentially unstable systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated Blockage Aware Placement of RIS in IIoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of deploying reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in mitigating coverage gaps and enhancing transmission reliability in an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network. First, we consider a single blockage scenario and characterize the correlation between blocking events of the base station (BS)-user and the RIS-user links and study its impact on the probability of establishing a viable reflected link. Then, by considering multiple blockages, we derive the distribution of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) as a function of data size, blockage density, the number of RISs, and the deployment area. We analyze the impact of normalized blockage radius and identify the threshold beyond which the assumption of independent blockages deviates from the ground truth of correlated blocking. Finally, we compare the outage performance of this RIS-assisted system with that operated with network- controlled relays, and demonstrate that while the relays provide a higher reliability beyond a certain blockage threshold, increasing the number of RISs may help mitigate this effect. These insights offer valuable design guidelines for deploying RIS-aided IIoT networks in dense blockage environments.</description>

      <title>Is the Frequency Principle always valid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\), considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning. However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order \(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent learning.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for entropic optimal transport under martingale-type constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces novel computational methods for entropic optimal transport (OT) problems under martingale-type conditions. The considered problems include the discrete martingale optimal transport (MOT) problem. Moreover, as the (super-)martingale conditions are equivalent to row-wise (in-)equality constraints on the coupling matrix, our work applies to a prevalent class of OT problems with structural constraints. Inspired by the recent empirical success of Sinkhorn-type algorithms, we propose an entropic formulation for the MOT problem and introduce Sinkhorn-type algorithms with sparse Newton iterations that utilize the (approximate) sparsity of the Hessian matrix of the dual objective. As exact martingale conditions are typically infeasible, we adopt entropic regularization to find an approximate constraint-satisfied solution. We show that, in practice, the proposed algorithms enjoy both super-exponential convergence and robustness with controllable thresholds for total constraint violations.</description>

      <title>Uncertain data assimilation for urban wind flow simulations with OpenLB-UQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of urban wind flow is essential for urban planning, pedestrian safety, and environmental management. Yet, it remains challenging due to uncertain boundary conditions and the high cost of conventional CFD simulations. This paper presents the use of the modular and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework OpenLB-UQ for urban wind flow simulations. We specifically use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled with a stochastic collocation (SC) approach based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). The framework introduces a relative-error noise model for inflow wind speeds based on real measurements. The model is propagated through a non-intrusive SC LBM pipeline using sparse-grid quadrature. Key quantities of interest, including mean flow fields, standard deviations, and vertical profiles with confidence intervals, are efficiently computed without altering the underlying deterministic solver. We demonstrate this on a real urban scenario, highlighting how uncertainty localizes in complex flow regions such as wakes and shear layers. The results show that the SC LBM approach provides accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions with significant computational efficiency, making OpenLB-UQ a practical tool for real-time urban wind analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite difference time domain method is one of the most popular methods in computational electromagnetics. This work considers two possible ways of generalising it to a meshless setting by employing local radial basis function interpolation. The resulting methods turn out to be unstable, but can be stabilised by adding properly chosen hyperviscosity terms to the update equations. We demonstrate that the proposed meshless methods are convergent and can enjoy a decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to the finite difference time domain method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel spectral solver for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics on dynamical spacetimes. By combining a high order discontinuous spectral method on mapped Chebyshev Fourier grids, our scheme attains exponential convergence. Implemented within a unified BSSN Valencia framework, the code evolves both Einstein and MHD fields self consistently, enabling fully coupled simulations of black hole accretion jet systems. We demonstrate spectral accuracy and entropy stability through convergence tests, and validate physical fidelity via equatorial embedding diagrams of horizon crossing GRMHD variables in Kerr Schild coordinates. Three dimensional scatter visualizations further highlight the solver's capability to capture complex magnetized plasma structures around rotating black holes. This approach paves the way for high order, low dissipation GRMHD simulations on exascale architectures, opening new avenues for precise modeling of strong field astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of data-driven balancing: What to sample for different balancing-based reduced models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quadrature-based balanced truncation (QuadBT) framework of arXiv:2104.01006 is a non-intrusive reformulation of balanced truncation (BT), a classical projection-based model-order reduction technique for linear systems. QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Nonlocal Approximation to Manifold Poisson Models with Neumann Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of nonlocal models to approximate the Poisson model on manifolds with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, where the manifolds are assumed to be embedded in high dimensional Euclid spaces.
  In comparison to the existing nonlocal approximation of Poisson models with Neumann boundary, we optimize the truncation error of model by adding an augmented function involving the second order normal derivative along the $2\delta$ layer of boundary, with $2\delta$ be the nonlocal interaction horizon. The 2nd normal derivative is expressed as the difference between the interior Laplacian and the boundary Laplacian.
  The concentration of our paper is on the construction of nonlocal model, the well-posedness of model, and its second-order convergence rate to its local counterpart. The localization rate of our nonlocal model is currently optimal among all related works even for the case of high dimensional Euclid spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose p and hp least-squares spectral element methods for one-dimensional elliptic boundary layer problems. Stability estimates are derived and we design numerical schemes based on minimizing the residuals in the sense of least-squares in appropriate Sobolev norms. We prove parameter robust uniform error estimates i.e. error in the approximation is independent of the boundary layer parameter. For the p-version we prove a robust uniform convergence rate of O(sqrt(log W)/W), where W denotes the polynomial order used in approximation and for the hp-version the convergence rate is shown to be O(e^(-W/logW)). Numerical results are presented for a number of model elliptic boundary layer problems confirming the theoretical estimates and uniform convergence results for the p and hp versions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a randomized lattice algorithm for approximating multivariate periodic functions over the $d$-dimensional unit cube from the weighted Korobov space with mixed smoothness $\alpha &gt; 1/2$ and product weights $\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\ldots\in [0,1]$. Building upon the deterministic lattice algorithm by Kuo, Sloan, and Wo\'{z}niakowski (2006), we incorporate a randomized quadrature rule by Dick, Goda, and Suzuki (2022) to accelerate the convergence rate. This randomization involves drawing the number of points for function evaluations randomly, and selecting a good generating vector for rank-1 lattice points using the randomized component-by-component algorithm. We prove that our randomized algorithm achieves a worst-case root mean squared $L_2$-approximation error of order $M^{-\alpha(2\alpha+1)/(4\alpha+1)+\varepsilon}$ for an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $M$ denotes the maximum number of function evaluations, and that the error bound is independent of the dimension $d$ if the weights satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j^{1/\alpha} &lt; \infty$. Our upper bound converges faster than a lower bound on the worst-case $L_2$-approximation error for deterministic rank-1 lattice-based approximation proved by Byrenheid, K\"{a}mmerer, Ullrich, and Volkmer (2017). We also show a lower error bound of order $M^{-\alpha/2-1/2}$ for our randomized algorithm, leaving a slight gap between the upper and lower bounds open for future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To construct positivity-preserving numerical methods, a vast majority of existing works employ transformation techniques such as the Lamperti transformation or logarithmic transformation. However, using these techniques often leads to the transformed stochastic differential equations (SDEs) not meeting the global monotonicity condition, particularly in multi-dimension case. This condition is essential for achieving strong convergence rates of numerical schemes. A pertinent question arises from this issue regarding the existence of an effective method with a convergence rate for solving multi-dimensional SDEs with positive solutions. This paper presents a positivity-preserving method that combines a novel truncated mapping with a truncated Euler--Maruyama discretization. We investigate both the strong convergence of the numerical method under some reasonable conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method achieves the optimal strong convergence order of 1/2 under certain additional assumptions. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate these theoretical results and demonstrate the positivity of the numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>A Lie algebra view of matrix splittings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use some basic facts from the theory of (matrix) Lie groups and algebras to show that many of the classical
  matrix splittings used to construct stationary iterative methods and preconditioniers for Krylov subspace methods can be interpreted as
  linearizations of matrix factorizations. Moreover, we show that
  new matrix splittings are obtained when we
  specialize these splittings to some of the classical matrix groups and their Lie and Jordan algebras. As an example, we derive structured generalizations
  of the HSS (Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting) iteration, and provide sufficient conditions for their convergence.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and geometric locking-free finite element implementation of a refined shell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate finite element analysis of refined shell theories is crucial but often hindered by membrane and shear locking effects. While various element-based locking-free techniques exist, this work addresses the problem at the theoretical level by utilizing results from asymptotic analysis. A formulation of a 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear is developed using rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation, ensuring equal asymptotic orders of magnitude for extension, bending, and rotation measures and their respective stiffnesses. This novel approach, implemented via isogeometric analysis, is shown to be both asymptotically accurate relative to the underlying refined shell theory and inherently free from membrane and shear locking. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells show excellent agreement between the analytical solutions, 2D refined shell theory predictions, and 3D elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a novel particle exchange Monte Carlo method. Whereas existing methods apply to eigenfunction problems where the eigenvalue is known (e.g., integrals with respect to a Gibbs measure, which can be interpreted as corresponding to eigenvalue zero), here the focus is on problems where the eigenvalue is not known a priori. To obtain an appropriate particle exchange rule we must consider a pair of processes, with one evolving forward in time and the other backward. Applications to eigenfunction problems corresponding to quasistationary distributions and ergodic stochastic control are discussed.</description>

      <title>A second-order accurate, positivity-preserving and mass conservative linear scheme for the Possion-Nernst-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-order linear positivity preserving schemes in time are available for the time dependent Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, second-order linear ones are still challenging. This paper proposes the first- and second-order exponential time differencing schemes with the finite difference spatial discretization for PNP equations, based on the $Slotboom$ transformation of the Nernst-Planck equations and linear stabilization technique. The proposed schemes are linear and preserve the mass conservation and positivity preservation of ion concentration at full discrete level without any constraints on the time step size. Extensive numerical results are carried out to support the theoretical findings and showcase the performance of the proposed schemes.</description>

Abstract: We verify quasi-optimality of the Crouzeix-Raviart FEM for nonlinear problems of $p$-Laplace type. More precisely, we show that the error of the Crouzeix-Raviart FEM with respect to a quasi-norm is bounded from above by a uniformly bounded constant times the best-approximation error plus a data oscillation term. As a byproduct, we verify a novel more localized a priori error estimate for the conforming lowest-order Lagrange FEM.</description>

      <title>Reduced basis solvers for unfitted methods on parameterized domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified framework for reduced basis approximations of parametrized partial differential equations defined on parameter-dependent domains. Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Provable Emergence of Deep Neural Collapse and Low-Rank Bias in $L^2$-Regularized Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has shown strong empirical and theoretical evidence of an implicit low-rank bias: weight matrices in deep networks tend to be approximately low-rank. Moreover, removing relatively small singular values during training, or from available trained models, may significantly reduce model size while maintaining or even improving model performance. However, the majority of the theoretical investigations around low-rank bias in neural networks deal with oversimplified models, often not taking into account the impact of nonlinearity. In this work, we first of all quantify a link between the phenomenon of deep neural collapse and the emergence of low-rank weight matrices for a general class of feedforward networks with nonlinear activation. In addition, for the general class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, we prove the global optimality of deep neural collapsed configurations and the practical absence of a loss barrier between interpolating minima and globally optimal points, offering a possible explanation for its common occurrence. As a byproduct, our theory also allows us to forecast the final global structure of singular values before training. Our theoretical findings are supported by a range of experimental evaluations illustrating the phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00891v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On Erlang mixture approximations for differential equations with distributed time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general approach for approximate simulation and analysis of delay differential equations (DDEs) with distributed time delays based on methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We show that the approximate ODEs can be used to assess the stability of the steady states of the original DDEs and that the solution to the ODEs converges if the kernel is also exponentially bounded. Additionally, we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical examples involve a modified logistic equation, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>From Taylor Series to Fourier Synthesis: The Periodic Linear Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.</description>

      <title>SGD Convergence under Stepsize Shrinkage in Low-Precision Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} &lt; 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.</description>

      <title>A generalized Hurwitz stability criterion via rectangular block Hankel matrices for nonmonic matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hurwitz stability criterion for nonmonic matrix polynomials via column reduction, generalizing existing approaches constrained by the monic assumption, as well as Gantmacher's classical stability criterion via Markov parameters. Starting from redefining the associated Markov parameters through a column-wise adaptive splitting method, our framework constructs two structured matrices whose rectangular Hankel blocks are obtained via the extraction of these parameters. We establish an explicit interrelation between the inertias of column reduced matrix polynomials and the derived structured matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hurwitz stability of column reduced matrix polynomials can be determined by the Hermitian positive definiteness of these rectangular block Hankel matrices.</description>
