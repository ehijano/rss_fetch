      <title>Noise Reinstates Collapsed Populations: Stochastic Reversal of Deterministic Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that environmental noise drives populations toward extinction. In contrast, we report a paradoxical phenomenon in which stochasticity reverses a deterministic tipping point, thereby preventing collapse. Using a hybrid model that integrates logistic growth with a density-triggered sigmoidal collapse, we uncover a striking reversal: deterministic fragility on one side, and stochastic rescue under weak noise on the other. Our analysis demonstrates that noise disrupts the convergence of deterministic trajectories toward extinction by altering the phase space topology, enabling back-transitions to viable states. This mechanism gives rise to noise-induced metastability and reveals a form of stochastic robustness not captured by deterministic models. These findings suggest that natural fluctuations can serve as a stabilizing force in complex systems, offering a compelling counter-narrative to classical models in ecology, epidemiology, and beyond. We advocate for a re-evaluation of stabilization strategies, emphasizing the constructive role of stochasticity in averting population collapse.</description>

      <title>Comparing lifetime and annual fitness measures reveals differences in selection outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selection analyses of long-term field data frequently use annual comparisons from longlived species with overlapping generations to measure fitness differences with respect to phenotypic characteristics, such as annual phenological timing. An alternative approach applies lifetime estimates of fitness that encompass several annual events. We studied selection on emergence date from hibernation in male and female Columbian ground squirrels, Urocitellus columbianus (Ord 1915). From 32 years of records, we estimated lifetime fitness using either lifetime reproductive success (LRS) or matrix methods, and estimated annual fitness from individual yearly survival and reproduction. We also modified estimates to statistically control for changes in mean population fitness over the lives of individuals. We regressed lifetime fitness metrics on dates of emergence from hibernation, to quantify the strength of selection on emergence date (a heritable trait). All fitness metrics were highly correlated, but differences became apparent when estimating selection coefficients for emergence dates. The annual fitness metric and LRS produced lower effect sizes of selection coefficients than matrix-based lifetime fitness and a lifespan approach based on average annual fitness. Further, only these last two metrics revealed stabilizing selection. These results suggest that the choice of a fitness metric may influence our conclusions about natural selection.</description>

      <title>Population density and vegetation resources influence demography in a hibernating herbivorous mammal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demography of herbivorous mammal populations may be affected by changes in predation, population density, harvesting, and climate. Whereas numerous studies have focused on the effect of single environmental variables on individual demographic processes, attempts to integrate the consequences of several environmental variables on numerous functional traits and demographic rates are rare. Over a 32-year period, we examined how forage availability (vegetation assessed through NDVI) and population density affected the functional traits and demographic rates of a population of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus), an herbivorous hibernating rodent. We focused on mean population phenology, body mass, breeding success and survival. We found a negative effect of population density on demographic rates, including on breeding success and pup and adult survival to the next year.  We found diverging effects of vegetation phenology on demographic rates: positive effects of earlier start to growing season on adult female and juvenile survival, but no clear effect on male survival. Interestingly, neither population density nor vegetation affected population phenology or body condition in the following year. Vegetative growth rate had a positive influence on female mass gain (somatic investment) over a season, but vegetative growth rate and biomass, surprisingly, had negative effects on the survival of young through their first hibernation. Later vegetative timing during the year had a positive influence on survival for all ground squirrels. Thus, ground squirrels appeared to benefit more from later timing of vegetation than increases in vegetative biomass per se. Our study provides evidence for complex ecological effects of vegetation and population density on functional traits and demographic rates of small mammal populations.</description>

      <title>Life history stage effects on alert and flight initiation distances in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When approached by predators, prey must decide whether to flee or remain and fight. The economics of such decisions are underlain by the trade-off between current and residual fitness.  The trade-off predicts that (i) breeders should be less prone than non-breeders to flee from approaching predators, as breeders can lose their investment into current reproduction; (ii) among breeders, parents should increasingly defend their offspring with increasing investment into the brood (brood value hypothesis), at least until the offspring can independently take part in anti-predator defenses; and (iii) for a similar investment into reproduction, breeders with lower perspectives to fledge or wean their young should invest less into offspring defense. We tested these predictions in a colonially breeding seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus).  Specifically, we considered how antipredator behaviors varied according to life history stage (molting, courting, breeding), offspring age and their dependence on parents for antipredator defenses, and the timing of breeding, with late breeders being very unlikely to fledge offspring in this species. Using non-lethal human approaches to mimic the threat of predation, we approached &gt;500 penguins and measured their alert and flight initiation distances, as well as the distance fled. We found that birds show increasingly stronger antipredator behaviors as they initiate and increase their investment into reproduction, from non-reproductive stages to courting and brooding small, thermo-dependent chicks. However, once offspring gained thermal independence and freedom of movement, parents reduced their antipredator behaviors. Late breeders were more likely to flee from the approaching threat than early breeders. Altogether, our results demonstrate that parental antipredator responses are dynamic and shaped by the levels 3 of investment into current reproduction, the ability of offspring to defend themselves, and the perceived future value of the brood.</description>

      <title>Beyond cognacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets, which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA) derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared. Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Network Behavioral-Feedback SIR Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a network behavioral-feedback Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model in which the interaction matrix describing the infection rates across subpopulations depends in feedback on the current epidemic state. This model captures both heterogeneities in individuals mixing, contact frequency, aptitude to contract and spread the infection, and endogenous behavioral responses such as voluntary social distancing and the adoption of self-protective measures. We study the stability of the equilibria and illustrate through several examples how the shape of the stability region depends on the structure of the interaction matrix, providing insights for the design of effective control strategies. We then analyze the transient behavior of the dynamics, showing that, for a special class of rank-1 interaction matrices, there always exists an aggregate infection curve that exhibits a unimodal behavior, expanding the results on the unimodality of infection curve known in the literature of epidemic models and paving the way for future control applications.</description>

      <title>Cost of institutional incentives for promoting cooperation in $2\times2$ games and collective risk games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prosocial behaviours have been extensively studied across multiple disciplines. Cooperation, requiring a personal cost for collective benefits, is widespread in nature and human society, having been explained through mechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, and network reciprocity. Institutional incentives, which reward cooperation and punish anti-social behaviour, offer a promising approach to fostering cooperation in groups of self-interested individuals. Focusing on general $2\times2$ games and the collective risk game (which is a fundamental model for climate action), we analyse the associated cost of providing incentives under evolutionary dynamics governed by Fermi's rule, exploring the asymptotic behaviour of the incentive cost functons in the limits of neutral drift and strong selection. We also implement numerical simulations to study how parameters such as the intensity of selection affect the behaviour of the aforementioned cost functions.</description>

      <title>Making mathematical online resources FAIR: at the example of small phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the process of taking an early 2000's mathematical library, the Small Phylogenetic Trees, and transforming it into a FAIR, modern, and sustainable repository for data from algebraic phylogenetics. This process is based on a three-fold strategy: (1) writing a software package which enables the user to reproduce results of the database; (2) setting up a user-friendly new website with cross links to theoretical publications, code snippets, and serialized output of computations; and (3) all-the-while documenting the steps we take in order to derive lessons learned which may be generalised to other such projects. This paper addresses (3). (1) is found in https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics/phylogenetics, and (2) is located at https://algebraicphylogenetics.org.</description>
