      <title>Stabilization of beam heated plasmas by beam modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constant intensity beam that propagates into a stationary plasma results in a bump-on-tail feature in velocity space. This results in an instability that transfers kinetic energy from the plasma to the electric field. We show that there are intensity profiles for the beam (found by numerical optimization) that can largely suppress this instability and drive the system into a state that, after the beam has been switched off, remains stable over long times. The modulated beam intensity requires no feedback, i.e. no knowledge of the physical system during time evolution is required, and the frequency of the modulation scales approximately inversely with system size, which is particularly favorable for large plasma systems. We also show that the results obtained are robust in the sense that perturbations, e.g. deviation from the optimized beam profiles, can be tolerated without losing the ability to suppress the instability.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Ultra-Relativistic Electron Bursts in Earth's Magnetotail Observed by Low-Altitude Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's magnetotail, a night-side region characterized by stretched magnetic field lines and strong plasma currents, is the primary site for the release of magnetic field energy and its transformation into plasma heating and kinetic energy plus charged particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection. In this study, we demonstrate that the efficiency of this acceleration can be sufficiently high to produce populations of relativistic and ultra-relativistic electrons, with energies up to several MeV, which exceeds all previous theoretical and simulation estimates. Using data from the low altitude ELFIN and CIRBE CubeSats, we show multiple events of relativistic electron bursts within the magnetotail, far poleward of the outer radiation belt. These bursts are characterized by power-law energy spectra and can be detected during even moderate substorms.</description>

      <title>Divertor shaping with neutral baffling as a solution to the tokamak power exhaust challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exhausting power from the hot fusion core to the plasma-facing components is one of the biggest challenges in fusion energy. The MAST Upgrade tokamak uniquely integrates strong containment of neutrals within the exhaust area (divertor) with extreme divertor shaping capability. By systematically altering the divertor shape, this study shows the strongest evidence to date that long-legged divertors with a high magnetic field gradient (total flux expansion) deliver key power exhaust benefits without adversely impacting the hot fusion core. These benefits are already achieved with relatively modest geometry adjustments that are more feasible to integrate in reactor designs. Benefits include reduced target heat loads and improved access to, and stability of, a neutral gas buffer that 'shields' the target and enhances power exhaust (detachment). Analysis and model comparisons shows these benefits are obtained by combining multiple shaping aspects: long-legged divertors have expanded plasma-neutral interaction volume that drive reductions in particle and power loads, while total flux expansion enhances detachment access and stability. Containing the neutrals in the exhaust area with physical structures further augments these shaping benefits. These results demonstrate strategic variation in the divertor geometry and magnetic topology is a potential solution to one of fusion's biggest challenges: power exhaust.</description>

      <title>Verification of Fast Ion Effects on Turbulence through Comparison of GENE and CGYRO with L-mode Plasmas in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a cross-verification of fast ion effects on turbulence through a systematic comparison of two leading gyrokinetic codes, GENE [T.Gorler et al., J. Comput. Phys. 230 7053-7071 (2011)] and CGYRO [J.Candy et al, J. Comput. Phys. 324 73-93 (2016)], using L-mode plasma profiles from KSTAR for local linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations. The focus is on the impact of fast ions and rotation effects on energy flux, aiming to identify the similarities and differences between these codes in the context of turbulence transport research. The analysis shows consistency in linear stability results, fractional changes in energy flux, and zonal shearing between the codes. However, discrepancies arise in absolute thermal energy levels, phase angle distribution, and rotation effects on energy transport, especially in the presence of fast ions. The study underscores the critical importance of phase angle analysis in gyrokinetic code verification, particularly when assessing fast ion effects on turbulence. Additionally, it highlights the need to examine quantities at lower levels of the primacy hierarchy, as discrepancies at higher levels can lead to divergent results at lower levels. These findings indicate the necessity for further investigation into these discrepancies and the novel phase angle structures observed, contributing to the advancement of accurate transport predictions in fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Causality Bounds on Dissipative General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a large class of relativistic generalizations of Braginskii's magnetohydrodynamics with shear, bulk, and heat diffusion effects is causal and strongly hyperbolic in the fully nonlinear regime in curved spacetime. We find that causality severely constrains the size of nonideal effects and the onset of kinetic instabilities. Our results are crucial for assessing the regime of validity of fluid dynamical simulations of plasmas near supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Validation of Thin-foil proton recoil neutron spectrometer prototype for application in high yield DT fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Thin-foil Proton Recoil (TPR) spectrometers for application in neutron spectroscopy is of high relevance for future fusion devices such as ITER, where neutron spectroscopy will play a crucial role in fuel content monitoring. Existing research based on simulations of the performance of TPR spectrometers at ITER has demonstrated positive results. However, experimental validation of the simulations would greatly benefit the reliability of conclusions. In this study, we designed and constructed a prototype TPR neutron spectrometer and employed a DT neutron generator as a neutron source to perform measurements. We compared the experimental results with the simulation results using the Geant4 model of the experiment. The simulation and experimental results match within silicon detector intrinsic energy resolution. This approach ensures the experimental validation of the Geant4 based simulations of the TPR spectrometer. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing nuclear reactions measured in silicon detectors, specifically $^{28}$Si(n,d) and $^{28}$Si(n,$\alpha$), for energy calibration purposes. A comparison of the experiment and the simulation shows that the mean peak energy and full width at half maximum are within 150 keV. The calculated detector efficiency underestimates the experimentally determined efficiency up to 33\%. Discrepancies in the measured energy spectrum indicate the need for a more refined model and experiment control. Overall, the successful validation of the developed Geant4 simulation model against the experimentally measured energy spectra increases confidence in the applicability of such simulation results in other devices. The demonstrated energy calibration highlights new possibilities for neutron spectrometer monitoring during operation at ITER.</description>
