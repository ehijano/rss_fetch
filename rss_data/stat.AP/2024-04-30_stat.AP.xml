      <title>Percentage Coefficient (bp) -- Effect Size Analysis (Theory Paper 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Percentage coefficient (bp) has emerged in recent publications as an additional and alternative estimator of effect size for regression analysis. This paper retraces the theory behind the estimator. It's posited that an estimator must first serve the fundamental function of enabling researchers and readers to comprehend an estimand, the target of estimation. It may then serve the instrumental function of enabling researchers and readers to compare two or more estimands. Defined as the regression coefficient when dependent variable (DV) and independent variable (IV) are both on conceptual 0-1 percentage scales, percentage coefficients (bp) feature 1) clearly comprehendible interpretation and 2) equitable scales for comparison. Thus, the coefficient (bp) serves both functions effectively and efficiently, thereby serving some needs not completely served by other indicators such as raw coefficient (bw) and standardized beta. Another fundamental premise of the functionalist theory is that "effect" is not a monolithic concept. Rather, it is a collection of compartments, each of which measures a component of the conglomerate that we call "effect." A regression coefficient (b), for example, measures one aspect of effect, which is unit effect, aka efficiency, as it indicates the unit change in DV associated with a one-unit increase in IV. Percentage coefficient (bp) indicates the change in DV in percentage points associated with a whole scale increase in IV. It is meant to be an all-encompassing indicator of the all-encompassing concept of effect, but rather an interpretable and comparable indicator of efficiency, one of the key components of effect.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Proximity Informed User Behavior in a Global Online Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the earlier claim of "Death of Distance", recent studies revealed that geographical proximity still greatly influences link formation in online social networks. However, it is unclear how physical distances are intertwined with users' online behaviors in a virtual world. We study the role of spatial dependence on a global online social network with a dyadic Logit model. Results show country-specific patterns for distance effect on probabilities to build connections. Effects are stronger when the possibility for two people to meet in person exists. Relative to weak ties, dependence on proximity is looser for strong social ties.</description>

      <title>The Impact of COVID-19 on Co-authorship and Economics Scholars' Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, prompting a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and coauthorship dynamics on research output. Using a novel dataset, this paper endeavors to make a first cut at investigating the role of peer effects on the productivity of economics scholars, measured by the number of publications, in both pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Results show that peer effect is significant for the pre-pandemic time but not for the pandemic time. The findings contribute to our understanding of how research collaboration influences knowledge production and may help guide policies aimed at fostering collaboration and enhancing research productivity in the academic community.</description>

      <title>Correcting for confounding in longitudinal experiments: positioning non-linear mixed effects modeling as implementation of standardization using latent conditional exchangeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-linear mixed effects modeling and simulation (NLME M&amp;S) is evaluated to be used for standardization with longitudinal data in presence of confounders. Standardization is a well-known method in causal inference to correct for confounding by analyzing and combining results from subgroups of patients. We show that non-linear mixed effects modeling is a particular implementation of standardization that conditions on individual parameters described by the random effects of the mixed effects model. Our motivation is that in pharmacometrics NLME M&amp;S is routinely used to analyze clinical trials and to predict and compare potential outcomes of the same patient population under different treatment regimens. Such a comparison is a causal question sometimes referred to as causal prediction. Nonetheless, NLME M&amp;S is rarely positioned as a method for causal prediction.
  As an example, a simulated clinical trial is used that assumes treatment confounder feedback in which early outcomes can cause deviations from the planned treatment schedule. Being interested in the outcome for the hypothetical situation that patients adhere to the planned treatment schedule, we put assumptions in a causal diagram. From the causal diagram, conditional independence assumptions are derived either using latent conditional exchangeability, conditioning on the individual parameters, or using sequential conditional exchangeability, conditioning on earlier outcomes. Both conditional independencies can be used to estimate the estimand of interest, e.g., with standardization, and they give unbiased estimates.</description>

      <title>Price Optimization Combining Conjoint Data and Purchase History: A Causal Modeling Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pricing decisions of companies require an understanding of the causal effect of a price change on the demand. When real-life pricing experiments are infeasible, data-driven decision-making must be based on alternative data sources such as purchase history (sales data) and conjoint studies where a group of customers is asked to make imaginary purchases in an artificial setup. We present an approach for price optimization that combines population statistics, purchase history and conjoint data in a systematic way. We build on the recent advances in causal inference to identify and quantify the effect of price on the purchase probability at the customer level. The identification task is a transportability problem whose solution requires a parametric assumption on the differences between the conjoint study and real purchases. The causal effect is estimated using Bayesian methods that take into account the uncertainty of the data sources. The pricing decision is made by comparing the estimated posterior distributions of gross profit for different prices. The approach is demonstrated with simulated data resembling the features of real-world data.</description>

      <title>Multiscale scanning with nuisance parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a multiscale scanning method to find anomalies in a $d$-dimensional random field in the presence of nuisance parameters. This covers the common situation that either the baseline-level or additional parameters such as the variance are unknown and have to be estimated from the data. We argue that state of the art approaches to determine asymptotically correct critical values for multiscale scanning statistics will in general fail when such parameters are naively replaced by plug-in estimators. Opposed to this, we suggest to estimate the nuisance parameters on the largest scale and to use (only) smaller scales for multiscale scanning. We prove a uniform invariance principle for the resulting adjusted multiscale statistic (AMS), which is widely applicable and provides a computationally feasible way to simulate asymptotically correct critical values. We illustrate the implications of our theoretical results in a simulation study and in a real data example from super-resolution STED microscopy. This allows us to identify interesting regions inside a specimen in a pre-scan with controlled family-wise error rate.</description>

      <title>Shifting the Paradigm: Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in the Development of Walkable Cities Design</title>

Abstract: The transformation of urban environments to accommodate growing populations has profoundly impacted public health and well-being. This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the impact of urban design interventions on diverse populations. Traditional approaches, reliant on questionnaires and stated preference techniques, are limited by recall bias and capturing the complex dynamics between environmental attributes and individual characteristics. To address these challenges, we integrate Virtual Reality (VR) with observational causal inference methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects, specifically employing Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) for its robustness against model misspecification. Our innovative approach leverages VR-based experiment to collect data that reflects perceptual and experiential factors. The result shows the heterogeneous impacts of urban design elements on public health and underscore the necessity for personalized urban design interventions. This study not only extends the application of TMLE to built environment research but also informs public health policy by illuminating the nuanced effects of urban design on mental well-being and advocating for tailored strategies that foster equitable, health-promoting urban spaces.</description>

      <title>Transportability of model-based estimands in evidence synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01757v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In evidence synthesis, effect modifiers are typically described as variables that induce treatment effect heterogeneity at the individual level, through treatment-covariate interactions in an outcome model parametrized at such level. As such, effect modification is defined with respect to a conditional measure, but marginal effect estimates are required for population-level decisions in health technology assessment. For non-collapsible measures, purely prognostic variables that are not determinants of treatment response at the individual level may modify marginal effects, even where there is individual-level treatment effect homogeneity. With heterogeneity, marginal effects for measures that are not directly collapsible cannot be expressed in terms of marginal covariate moments, and generally depend on the joint distribution of conditional effect measure modifiers and purely prognostic variables. There are implications for recommended practices in evidence synthesis. Unadjusted anchored indirect comparisons can be biased in the absence of individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity, or when marginal covariate moments are balanced across studies. Covariate adjustment may be necessary to account for cross-study imbalances in joint covariate distributions involving purely prognostic variables. In the absence of individual patient data for the target, covariate adjustment approaches are inherently limited in their ability to remove bias for measures that are not directly collapsible. Directly collapsible measures would facilitate the transportability of marginal effects between studies by: (1) reducing dependence on model-based covariate adjustment where there is individual-level treatment effect homogeneity or marginal covariate moments are balanced; and (2) facilitating the selection of baseline covariates for adjustment where there is individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Logistic regression with missing responses and predictors: a review of existing approaches and a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work logistic regression when both the response and the predictor variables may be missing is considered. Several existing approaches are reviewed, including complete case analysis, inverse probability weighting, multiple imputation and maximum likelihood. The methods are compared in a simulation study, which serves to evaluate the bias, the variance and the mean squared error of the estimators for the regression coefficients. In the simulations, the maximum likelihood methodology is the one that presents the best results, followed by multiple imputation with five imputations, which is the second best. The methods are applied to a case study on the obesity for schoolchildren in the municipality of Viana do Castelo, North Portugal, where a logistic regression model is used to predict the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) indicator from physical examinations and the past values of the obesity status. All the variables in the case study are potentially missing, with gender as the only exception. The results provided by the several methods are in well agreement, indicating the relevance of the past values of IOTF and physical scores for the prediction of obesity. Practical recommendations are given.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Hybrid Design with Borrowing from Historical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In early phase drug development of combination therapy, the primary objective is to preliminarily assess whether there is additive activity when a novel agent combined with an established monotherapy. Due to potential feasibility issues with a large randomized study, uncontrolled single-arm trials have been the mainstream approach in cancer clinical trials. However, such trials often present significant challenges in deciding whether to proceed to the next phase of development. A hybrid design, leveraging data from a completed historical clinical study of the monotherapy, offers a valuable option to enhance study efficiency and improve informed decision-making. Compared to traditional single-arm designs, the hybrid design may significantly enhance power by borrowing external information, enabling a more robust assessment of activity. The primary challenge of hybrid design lies in handling information borrowing. We introduce a Bayesian dynamic power prior (DPP) framework with three components of controlling amount of dynamic borrowing. The framework offers flexible study design options with explicit interpretation of borrowing, allowing customization according to specific needs. Furthermore, the posterior distribution in the proposed framework has a closed form, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency. The proposed framework's utility is demonstrated through simulations and a case study.</description>
