      <title>Combining relatively hyperbolic groups over a complex of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex of groups $G(\mathcal{Y}) = (G_\sigma, \psi_a, g_{a,b})$ where all $G_\sigma$ are relatively hyperbolic, the $\psi_a$ are inclusions of full relatively quasiconvex subgroups, and the universal cover $X$ is CAT$(0)$ and $\delta$--hyperbolic, we show $\pi_1(G(\mathcal{Y}))$ is relatively hyperbolic. The proof extends the work of Dahmani and Martin by constructing a model for the Bowditch boundary of $\pi_1(G(\mathcal{Y}))$. We prove the model is a compact metrizable space on which $G$ acts as a geometrically finite convergence group, and a theorem of Yaman then implies the result. More generally, this model shows how any suitable action of a relatively hyperbolic group on a simply connected cell complex encodes a decomposition of the Bowditch boundary into the boundary of the cell complex and the boundaries of cell stabilizers. We hope this decomposition will be helpful in answering topological questions about Bowditch boundaries.</description>

      <title>The geometry of subgroups of mapping tori of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated mapping tori of free groups have a canonical collection of maximal sub-mapping tori of finitely generated free groups with respect to which they are relatively hyperbolic and locally relatively quasi-convex. As a consequence, we characterise locally quasi-convex hyperbolic groups amongst free-by-cyclic and one-relator groups. We also upgrade several known results for mapping tori of finitely generated free groups to the general case, such as the computations of Dehn functions, the solution to the conjugacy problem and the characterisation of the finitely generated intersection property.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter Equation and Characteristic Finite Simple Quotients of the Free Group of Rank $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that infinitely many alternating groups arise as quotients of the free group of rank 2, with kernel a characteristic subgroup. We also show that such simple quotients exist of arbitrarily large Lie rank. This resolves two questions posed by arXiv:2308.14302</description>

      <title>Feit's conjecture, the canonical Brauer induction formula, and Adams operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by a strong version of Feit's conjecture, first formulated by the authors in joint work with A. Kleshchev and P. H. Tiep in 2025, concerning the conductor $c(\chi)$ of an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$. We connect the conjecture with the following construction: For any positive integer $n$ dividing the exponent of $G$ and for any character $\chi$ of $G$, we introduce an integer-valued invariant $S(G,\chi,n)$ which can be defined as the sum of certain coefficients of the canonical Brauer induction formula of $\chi$, or alternatively as the multiplicity of the trivial character in a specified integral linear combination of Adams operations of $\chi$. We show two facts about this invariant. The first seems of independent interest (apart from Feit's conjecture): $S(G,\chi,n)$ is always non-negative, and it is positive if and only if a representation affording $\chi$ involves an eigenvalue of order $n$. Secondly, the strong version of Feit's conjecture holds for an irreducible character $\chi$ if and only if $S(G,\chi, c(\chi))&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A notion of quasiconvex subgroups in acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a notion of quasiconvexity in the setting of finitely-generated groups with hyperbolically embedded subgroups. Our main result shows that this notion yields uniform quasiconvex constants in the setting of coned-off cusped spaces. We also prove that this notion of quasiconvexity is preserved under sufficiently long Dehn filling. As an application, we generalize a theorem of Groves-Manning on groups acting on $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes.</description>

      <title>Virtual fibring of manifolds and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topic of this survey is the phenomenon of fibring over the circle for manifolds, and its group-theoretic twin, algebraic fibring. We will discuss the state of the art, and explain briefly some of the ideas behind the more recent developments, focusing on RFRS groups and manifolds with such fundamental groups. Then we will move on to a more speculative part, where many conjectures about fibring in higher dimensions will be given. The conjectures vary in their level of plausibility, but even the boldest of them might share the fate of Thurston's Virtually Fibred Conjecture, about which Thurston famously said: ``This dubious-sounding question seems to have a definite chance for a positive answer''.</description>

      <title>Regular bipartite multigraphs have many (but not too many) symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ and $l$ be integers, both at least 2. A $(k,l)$-bipartite graph is an $l$-regular bipartite multigraph with coloured bipartite sets of size $k$. Define $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ to be the minimum and maximum order of automorphism groups of $(k,l)$-bipartite graphs, respectively. We determine $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ for $k\geq 8$, and analyse the generic situation when $k$ is fixed and $l$ is large. In particular, we show that almost all such graphs have automorphism groups which fix the vertices pointwise and have order far less than $\mu(k,l)$. These graphs are intimately connected with both contingency tables with uniform margins and uniform set partitions; we examine the uniform distribution on the set of $k\times k$ contingency tables with uniform margin $l$, showing that with high probability all entries stray far from the mean. We also show that the symmetric group acting on uniform set partitions is non-synchronizing.</description>

      <title>Note on the linearisation of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $K$ is a field with enough roots of unity and $V$ an abelian group, the $K$-algebra $K[V]$ of the group $V$ is split semisimple, so that the canonical morphism $K[V]\to K^{V^\sharp}$, where $V^\sharp$ denotes the dual group of $V$ (which may be seen as Hom$(V,K^\times)$), is an isomorphism of $K$-algebras. If one removes the assumption that $K$ has enough roots of unity, one can easily deduce from it (by using a base change and Krull-Schmidt) that it remains a $K$-linear isomorphism $K[V]\xrightarrow{\simeq} K^{V^\sharp}$ natural in the group $V$ if one restricts to finite groups $V$ canceled by a fixed nonzero integer. The question of whether such an isomorphism, natural in the abelian group $V$, still exists without any other restriction than $V$ is finite and its order is invertible in $K$, is less obvious; we solve it positively, in a somewhat more general setting ($K$ being any commutative ring), by using Gauss sums. We also explore some related functorial questions.</description>

      <title>Classification of thin Jordan schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

      <title>A novel approach through spherical functions in the characterization of invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact subgroup K of the orthogonal group acting on the Euclidean space Rn, Gerald Schwarz proved that every smooth K-invariant function on Rn can be expressed as a smooth function of a generating set of $K$-invariant polynomials on n variables. The goal of this work is to provide an alternative and more straightforward proof of this result, based on Gelfand theory, with a particular focus on spherical functions.</description>
