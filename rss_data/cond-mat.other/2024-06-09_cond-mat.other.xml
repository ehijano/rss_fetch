      <title>Stoichiometry-induced ferromagnetism in altermagnetic candidate MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of spintronics has seen a surge of interest in altermagnetism due to novel predictions and many possible applications. MnTe is a leading altermagnetic candidate that is of significant interest across spintronics due to its layered antiferromagnetic structure, high Neel temperature (TN ~ 310 K) and semiconducting properties. We present results on molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown MnTe/InP(111) films. Here, it is found that the electronic and magnetic properties are driven by the natural stoichiometry of MnTe. Electronic transport and in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy show the films are natively metallic with the Fermi level in the valence band and the band structure is in good agreement with first principles calculations for altermagnetic spin-splitting. Neutron diffraction confirms that the film is antiferromagnetic with planar anisotropy and polarized neutron reflectometry indicates weak ferromagnetism, which is linked to a slight Mn-richness that is intrinsic to the MBE grown samples. When combined with the anomalous Hall effect, this work shows that the electronic response is strongly affected by the ferromagnetic moment. Altogether, this highlights potential mechanisms for controlling altermagnetic ordering for diverse spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Modulation instability in dispersive parity-broken systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the interplay between dispersive parity breaking and non-linearity in two contrasting continuous dynamical systems that exhibit Modulation Instability (MI). We begin by examining deep water odd surface gravity waves and derive the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) for the modulated envelope dynamics using the method of multiple scales. The parity breaking in the odd gravity waves results in distinct NLSEs for the right and the left mover, leading to chirality-dependent stability properties for the envelope dynamics. Moreover, the resonant interaction of gravity waves and odd viscosity-induced capillary dynamics creates a window of wave numbers in one of the chiral sectors where the envelope propagation remains stable. Following the odd gravity results, we design a one-dimensional non-reciprocal PT-symmetric dielectric model that exhibits parity-breaking effects that are analogous to the odd viscosity term in 2D hydrodynamics. With cubic non-linearity in the polarization dynamics, we derive the corresponding NLSE. Once again, we observe that parity breaking stabilizes the modulated envelope dynamics in the lower polariton bands. We then compare the similarities and differences between this case and that of odd gravity waves.</description>
