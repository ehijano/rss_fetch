      <title>Analysis of Quantization Noise Suppression Gains in Digital Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital phased arrays have often been disregarded for millimeter-wave communications since the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are power-hungry. In this paper, we provide a different perspective on this matter by demonstrating analytically and numerically how the ADC resolution can be reduced when using digital phased arrays. We perform a theoretical analysis of the quantization noise characteristics for an OFDM signal received and processed by a digital phased array, using Gaussian approximation of the OFDM signal. In particular, we quantify the quantization noise suppression factor analytically and numerically. This factor describes how much the coherent combining reduces the quantization noise as a function of the number of antennas, which allows for reducing the ADC bit resolution. For instance in a 8-16 antenna digital phased array the ADC resolution can be reduced with 1-2 bits compared to the ADC required for an analog phased array.</description>

      <title>Can FSK Be Optimised for Integrated Sensing and Communications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ideal peak-to-average-power ratio and radar sensing capability of traditional frequency-coded radar waveforms, this paper considers the frequency shift keying (FSK) based waveform for joint communications and radar (JCR). An analysis of the probability distributions of its ambiguity function (AF) sidelobe levels (SLs) and peak sidelobe level (PSL) is conducted to study the radar sensing capability of random FSK. Numerical results show that the independent frequency modulation introduces uncontrollable AF PSLs. In order to address this problem, the initial phases of waveform sub-pulses are designed by solving a min-max optimisation problem. Numerical results indicate that the optimisation-based phase design can effectively reduce the AF PSL to a level close to well-designed radar waveforms while having no impact on the data rate and the receiver complexity. For large numbers of waveform sub-pulses and modulation orders, the impact on the error probability is also insignificant.</description>

      <title>Splitting Messages in the Dark- Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for FDD Massive MIMO Without CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical hindrance to realize frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is overhead associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that achieves robust performances while completely eliminating downlink CSIT training and feedback. Specifically, by exploiting partial frequency invariance of channel parameters between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), we adopt the 2D-Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-NOMP) algorithm to reconstruct DL CSIT from UL training. Due to inherent discrepancies arising from a carrier frequency difference between two disjoint bands, however, the multi-user interference is inevitable. To overcome this, we propose a precoding method that employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and also develop an error covariance matrix (ECM) estimation method by using the observed Fisher information matrix (O-FIM). We find that this ECM estimation is crucial for our precoding design in maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that our method significantly improves the sum SE compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of our ECM estimation.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Near-Field Localization with XL-MIMO Sectored Uniform Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancement of antenna technology catalyses the popularization of extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) antenna arrays, which pose unique challenges for localization with the inescapable near-field effect. In this paper, we propose an efficient near-field localization algorithm by leveraging a sectored uniform circular array (sUCA). In particular, we first customize a backprojection algorithm in the polar coordinate for sUCA-enabled near-field localization, which facilitates the target detection procedure. We then analyze the resolutions in both angular and distance domains via deriving the interval of zero-crossing points, and further unravel the minimum required number of antennas to eliminate grating lobes. The proposed localization method is finally implemented using fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results verify the resolution analysis and demonstrate that the proposed method remarkably outperforms conventional localization algorithms in terms of localization accuracy. Moreover, the low-complexity FFT implementation achieves an average runtime that is hundreds of times faster when large numbers of antenna elements are employed.</description>

      <title>Reed-Solomon Codes over Cyclic Polynomial Ring with Lower Encoding/Decoding Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are constructed over a finite field that have been widely employed in storage and communication systems. Many fast encoding/decoding algorithms such as fast Fourier transform (FFT) and modular approach are designed for RS codes to reduce the encoding/decoding complexity defined as the number of XORs involved in the encoding/decoding procedure. In this paper, we present the construction of RS codes over the cyclic polynomial ring $ \mathbb{F}_2[x]/(1+x+\ldots+x^{p-1})$ and show that our codes are maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. Moreover, we propose the FFT and modular approach over the ring that can be employed in our codes for encoding/decoding complexity reduction. We show that our codes have 17.9\% encoding complexity reduction and 7.5\% decoding complexity reduction compared with RS codes over finite field, for $(n,k)=(2048,1984)$.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Interacting Wireless Repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network with multiple single-antenna repeaters that amplify and instantaneously re-transmit the signals they receive to improve the channel rank and system coverage. Due to the positive feedback formed by inter-repeater interference, stability could become a critical issue. We investigate the problem of determining the maximum amplification gain that the repeaters can use without breaking the system stability. Specifically, we obtain a bound by using the Gershgorin disc theorem, which reveals that the maximum amplification gain is restricted by the sum of channel amplitude gains. We show by case studies the usefulness of the so-obtained bound and provide insights on how the repeaters should be deployed.</description>

      <title>Multi-user ISAC through Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: New Algorithms and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM)-assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) system. An extended target model is considered, where the BS aims to estimate the complete target response matrix relative to the SIM. Under the constraints of minimum Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for the communication users (CUs) and maximum transmit power, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and the end-to-end transmission matrix of the SIM, to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for target estimation. Effective algorithms such as the alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are employed to solve the non-convex SINR-constrained CRB minimization problem. Finally, we design and build an experimental platform for SIM, and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for communication and sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate Analysis of Intelligent Omni-Surface Assisted NOMA Holographic MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intelligent omni-surface (IOS) assisted holographic multiple-input and multiple-output architecture is conceived for $360^\circ$ full-space coverage at a low energy consumption. The theoretical ergodic rate lower bound of our non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is derived based on the moment matching approximation method, while considering the signal distortion at transceivers imposed by hardware impairments (HWIs). Furthermore, the asymptotically ergodic rate lower bound is derived both for an infinite number of IOS elements and for continuous aperture surfaces. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the achievable rate of the NOMA scheme is higher than that of its orthogonal multiple access counterpart. Furthermore, owing to the HWIs at the transceivers, the achievable rate saturates at high signal-to-noise ratio region, instead of reaching its theoretical maximum.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces Operating in the Presence of Realistic Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) constitute a promising technique of supporting energy-efficient communications. In this paper, we formulate the energy efficiency maximization problem of the switch-controlled RHS-aided beamforming architecture by alternately optimizing the holographic beamformer at the RHS, the digital beamformer, the total transmit power and the power sharing ratio of each user. Specifically, to deal with this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we decouple it into three sub-problems. Firstly, the coefficients of RHS elements responsible for the holographic beamformer are optimized to maximize the sum of the eigen-channel gains of all users by our proposed low-complexity eigen-decomposition (ED) method. Then, the digital beamformer is designed by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to support multi-user information transfer. Finally, the total transmit power and the power sharing ratio are alternately optimized, while considering the effect of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI). We theoretically derive the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency performance upper bound for the RHS-based beamforming architectures in the presence of HWIs. Our simulation results show that the switch-controlled RHS-aided beamforming architecture achieves higher energy efficiency than the conventional fully digital beamformer and the hybrid beamformer based on phase shift arrays (PSA). Moreover, considering the effect of HWI in the beamforming design can bring about further energy efficiency enhancements.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces in the Near-Field Scenario of Cell-Free Networks Under Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid beamforming architecture for near-field reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) harnessed in cell-free networks. Specifically, the holographic beamformer of each base station (BS) is designed for maximizing the channel gain based on the local channel state information (CSI). By contrast, the digital beamformer at the central processing unit is designed based on the minimum mean squared error criterion. Furthermore, the near-field spectral efficiency of the RHS in cell-free networks is derived theoretically by harnessing the popular stochastic geometry approach. We consider both the phase shift error (PSE) at the RHS elements and the hardware impairment (HWI) at the radio frequency (RF) chains of the transceivers. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the asymptotic capacity bound, when considering an infinite physical size for the RHS in the near-field channel model. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the PSE at the RHS elements and the HWI at the RF chains of transceivers limit the spectral efficiency in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. Moreover, we show that the PSE at the RHS elements and the HWI at the RF chains of BSs can be compensated by increasing the number of BSs. Finally, we also demonstrate that the ergodic spectral efficiency based on the near-field channel model is higher than that based on the far-field channel model assumption.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Intelligent Omni-Surface Aided Systems Suffering From Imperfect CSI and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), intelligent omni-surfaces (IOS) are capable of full-space coverage of smart radio environments by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting the incident signals. In this paper, we investigate the ergodic spectral efficiency of IOS-aided systems for transmission over random channel links, while considering both realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI) and transceiver hardware impairments (HWIs). Firstly, we formulate the linear minimum mean square error estimator of the equivalent channel spanning from the user equipments (UEs) to the access point (AP), where the transceiver HWIs are also considered. Then, we apply a two-timescale protocol for designing the beamformer of the IOS-aided system. Specifically, for the active AP beamformer, the minimum mean square error combining method is employed, which relies on the estimated equivalent channels, on the statistical information of the channel estimation error, on the inter-user interference as well as on the HWIs at the AP and UEs. By contrast, the passive IOS beamformer is designed based on the statistical CSI for maximizing the upper bound of the ergodic spectral efficiency. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the transceiver HWIs have a significant effect on the ergodic spectral efficiency, especially in the high transmit power region. Furthermore, we show that the HWIs at the AP can be effectively compensated by deploying more AP antennas.</description>

      <title>Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis of EMF Exposure of Idle Users and Network Performance with Dynamic Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel mathematical framework based on stochastic geometry to investigate the electromagnetic field exposure of idle and active users in cellular networks implementing dynamic beamforming. Accurate modeling of antenna gain becomes crucial in this context, encompassing both the main and the side lobes. The marginal distribution of EMF exposure for each type of users is initially derived. Subsequently, network performance is scrutinized by introducing a new metric aimed at ensuring minimal downlink coverage while simultaneously maintaining EMF exposure below distinct thresholds for both idle and active users. The metrics exhibit a high dependency on various parameters, such as the distance between active and idle users and the number of antenna elements.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Sensing Via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new wireless sensing system equipped with the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can flexibly adjust the positions of antenna elements for improving the sensing performance over conventional antenna arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). First, we show that the angle estimation performance in wireless sensing is fundamentally determined by the array geometry, where the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is derived as a function of the antennas' positions for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays. Then, for the case of 1D MA array, we obtain a globally optimal solution for the MAs' positions in closed form to minimize the CRB of AoA estimation MSE. While in the case of 2D MA array, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In particular, for the special case of circular antenna movement region, an optimal solution for the MAs' positions is derived under certain numbers of MAs and circle radii. Thereby, both the lower- and upper-bounds of the min-max CRB are obtained for the antenna movement region with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution for MAs' positions by iteratively optimizing one between their horizontal and vertical coordinates with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed 1D/2D MA arrays can significantly decrease the CRB of AoA estimation MSE as well as the actual MSE compared to conventional uniform linear arrays (ULAs)/uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with different values of uniform inter-antenna spacing.</description>

      <title>Stability of Information in the Heat Flow Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering methods must be tailored to the dataset it operates on, as there is no objective or universal definition of ``cluster,'' but nevertheless arbitrariness in the clustering method must be minimized. This paper develops a quantitative ``stability'' method of determining clusters, where stable or persistent clustering signals are used to indicate real structures have been identified in the underlying dataset. This method is based on modulating clustering methods by controlling a parameter -- through a thermodynamic analogy, the modulation parameter is considered ``time'' and the evolving clustering methodologies can be considered a ``heat flow.'' When the information entropy of the heat flow is stable over a wide range of times -- either globally or in the local sense which we define -- we interpret this stability as an indication that essential features of the data have been found, and create clusters on this basis.</description>

      <title>Using Waste Factor to Optimize Energy Efficiency in Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Waste Factor (W) and Waste Figure (WF) to assess power efficiency in any multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) or single-input multiple-output (SIMO) or multiple-input single-output (MISO) cascaded communication system. This paper builds upon the new theory of Waste Factor, which systematically models added wasted power in any cascade for parallel systems such as MISO, SIMO, and MIMO systems, which are prevalent in current wireless networks. Here, we also show the advantage of W compared to conventional metrics for quantifying and analyzing energy efficiency. This work explores the utility of W in assessing energy efficiency in communication channels, within Radio Access Networks (RANs).</description>

      <title>Systematic Construction of Golay Complementary Sets of Arbitrary Lengths and Alphabet Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the important applications of Golay complementary sets (GCSs) is the reduction of peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. OFDM has played a major role in modern wireless systems such as long-term-evolution (LTE), 5th generation (5G) wireless standards, etc. This paper searches for systematic constructions of GCSs of arbitrary lengths and alphabet sizes. The proposed constructions are based on extended Boolean functions (EBFs). For the first time, we can generate codes of independent parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Error Correction Capabilities of Non-Linear Cryptographic Hash Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear hashes are known to possess error-correcting capabilities. However, in most applications, non-linear hashes with pseudorandom outputs are utilized instead. It has also been established that classical non-systematic random codes, both linear and non-linear, are capacity achieving in the asymptotic regime. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that non-linear hashes might also exhibit good error-correcting capabilities. In this paper, we show this to be the case. Our proof is based on techniques from multiple access channels. As a consequence, we show that Systematic Random Non-Linear Codes (S-RNLC) are capacity achieving in the asymptotic regime. We validate our results by comparing the performance of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) with that of Systematic Random Linear Codes (SRLC) and S-RNLC, demonstrating that SHA performs equally.</description>

      <title>Model-based Deep Learning for Rate Split Multiple Access in Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate split multiple access (RSMA) has been proven as an effective communication scheme for 5G and beyond, especially in vehicular scenarios. However, RSMA requires complicated iterative algorithms for proper resource allocation, which cannot fulfill the stringent latency requirement in resource constrained vehicles. Although data driven approaches can alleviate this issue, they suffer from poor generalizability and scarce training data. In this paper, we propose a fractional programming (FP) based deep unfolding (DU) approach to address resource allocation problem for a weighted sum rate optimization in RSMA. By carefully designing the penalty function, we couple the variable update with projected gradient descent algorithm (PGD). Following the structure of PGD, we embed few learnable parameters in each layer of the DU network. Through extensive simulation, we have shown that the proposed model-based neural networks has similar performance as optimal results given by traditional algorithm but with much lower computational complexity, less training data, and higher resilience to test set data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data.</description>

      <title>Delay and Overhead Efficient Transmission Scheduling for Federated Learning in UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the wireless scheduling design to coordinate the transmissions of (local) model parameters of federated learning (FL) for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The overall goal of the proposed design is to realize the FL training and aggregation processes with a central aggregator exploiting the sensory data collected by the UAVs but it considers the multi-hop wireless network formed by the UAVs. Such transmissions of model parameters over the UAV-based wireless network potentially cause large transmission delays and overhead. Our proposed framework smartly aggregates local model parameters trained by the UAVs while efficiently transmitting the underlying parameters to the central aggregator in each FL global round. We theoretically show that the proposed scheme achieves minimal delay and communication overhead. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to other baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between problems studied in rigidity theory and matroids arising from linear algebraic constructions like tensor products and symmetric products. A special case of this correspondence identifies the problem of giving a description of the correctable erasure patterns in a maximally recoverable tensor code with the problem of describing bipartite rigid graphs or low-rank completable matrix patterns. Additionally, we relate dependencies among symmetric products of generic vectors to graph rigidity and symmetric matrix completion. With an eye toward applications to computer science, we study the dependency of these matroids on the characteristic by giving new combinatorial descriptions in several cases, including the first description of the correctable patterns in an (m, n, a=2, b=2) maximally recoverable tensor code.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection with Confusing Change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the problem of quickest change detection (QCD), a change occurs at some unknown time in the distribution of a sequence of independent observations. This work studies a QCD problem where the change is either a bad change, which we aim to detect, or a confusing change, which is not of our interest. Our objective is to detect a bad change as quickly as possible while avoiding raising a false alarm for pre-change or a confusing change. We identify a specific set of pre-change, bad change, and confusing change distributions that pose challenges beyond the capabilities of standard Cumulative Sum (CuSum) procedures. Proposing novel CuSum-based detection procedures, S-CuSum and J-CuSum, leveraging two CuSum statistics, we offer solutions applicable across all kinds of pre-change, bad change, and confusing change distributions. For both S-CuSum and J-CuSum, we provide analytical performance guarantees and validate them by numerical results. Furthermore, both procedures are computationally efficient as they only require simple recursive updates.</description>

Abstract: The growing reliance on digital twins across various industries and domains brings with it semantic interoperability challenges. Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</description>

      <title>CrossMPT: Cross-attention Message-Passing Transformer for Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error correcting codes~(ECCs) are indispensable for reliable transmission in communication systems. The recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the exploration of ECC decoders based on neural networks. Among these, transformer-based neural decoders have achieved state-of-the-art decoding performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-attention Message-Passing Transformer~(CrossMPT). CrossMPT iteratively updates two types of input vectors (i.e., magnitude and syndrome vectors) using two masked cross-attention blocks. The mask matrices in these cross-attention blocks are determined by the code's parity-check matrix that delineates the relationship between magnitude and syndrome vectors. Our experimental results show that CrossMPT significantly outperforms existing neural network-based decoders, particularly in decoding low-density parity-check codes. Notably, CrossMPT also achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, achieving over a 50\% decrease in its attention layers compared to the original transformer-based decoder, while retaining the computational complexity of the remaining layers.</description>

      <title>Spanning Tree Matching Decoder for Quantum Surface Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the spanning tree matching (STM) decoder for surface codes, which guarantees the error correction capability up to the code's designed distance by first employing an instance of the minimum spanning tree on a subset of ancilla qubits within the lattice. Then, a perfect matching graph is simply obtained, by selecting the edges more likely to be faulty. A comparative analysis reveals that the STM decoder, at the cost of a slight performance degradation, provides a substantial advantage in decoding time compared to the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder. Finally, we propose an even more simplified and faster algorithm, the Rapid-Fire (RFire) decoder, designed for scenarios where decoding speed is a critical requirement.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Bistatic MIMO Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the beamforming optimization for sensing a point-like scatterer using a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar, which could be part of a joint communication and sensing system. The goal is to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound on the target position's estimation error, where the radar already knows an approximate position that is taken into account in the optimization. The optimization allows for beamforming with more than one beam per subcarrier. Optimal solutions for the beamforming are discussed for known and unknown channel gain. Numerical results show that beamforming with at most one beam per subcarrier is optimal for certain parameters, but for other parameters, optimal solutions need two beams on some subcarriers. In addition, the degree of freedom in selecting which end of the bistatic radar should transmit and receive is considered.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Aided Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer structure employed in large language models (LLMs), as a specialized category of deep neural networks (DNNs) featuring attention mechanisms, stands out for their ability to identify and highlight the most relevant aspects of input data. Such a capability is particularly beneficial in addressing a variety of communication challenges, notably in the realm of semantic communication where proper encoding of the relevant data is critical especially in systems with limited bandwidth. In this work, we employ vision transformers specifically for the purpose of compression and compact representation of the input image, with the goal of preserving semantic information throughout the transmission process. Through the use of the attention mechanism inherent in transformers, we create an attention mask. This mask effectively prioritizes critical segments of images for transmission, ensuring that the reconstruction phase focuses on key objects highlighted by the mask. Our methodology significantly improves the quality of semantic communication and optimizes bandwidth usage by encoding different parts of the data in accordance with their semantic information content, thus enhancing overall efficiency. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, focusing on both reconstruction quality and accuracy. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our framework successfully preserves semantic information, even when only a fraction of the encoded data is transmitted, according to the intended compression rates.</description>

      <title>Time Encoding Quantization of Bandlimited and Finite-Rate-of-Innovation Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of quantization in integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (IF-TEM) sampler used for bandlimited (BL) and finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals. An upper bound is derived for the mean squared error (MSE) of IF-TEM sampler and is compared against that of classical analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with uniform sampling and quantization. The interplay between a signal's energy, bandwidth, and peak amplitude is used to identify how the MSE of IF-TEM sampler with quantization is influenced by these parameters. More precisely, the quantization step size of the IF-TEM sampler can be reduced when the maximum frequency of a bandlimited signal or the number of pulses of an FRI signal is increased. Leveraging this insight, specific parameter settings are identified for which the quantized IF-TEM sampler achieves an MSE bound that is roughly 8 dB lower than that of a classical ADC with the same number of bits. Experimental results validate the theoretical conclusions.</description>

Abstract: Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) is a self-supervised learning (SSL) method that has shown promising results on a variety of tasks. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying VICReg remain unexplored. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic perspective on the VICReg objective. We begin by deriving information-theoretic quantities for deterministic networks as an alternative to unrealistic stochastic network assumptions. We then relate the optimization of the VICReg objective to mutual information optimization, highlighting underlying assumptions and facilitating a constructive comparison with other SSL algorithms and derive a generalization bound for VICReg, revealing its inherent advantages for downstream tasks. Building on these results, we introduce a family of SSL methods derived from information-theoretic principles that outperform existing SSL techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the notion of $d$-embedding $\Gamma$ of a (canonical) subgeometry $\Sigma$ and of exterior set with respect to the $h$-secant variety $\Omega_{h}(\mathcal{A})$ of a subset $\mathcal{A}$, $ 0 \leq h \leq n-1$, in the finite projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q^n)$, $n \geq 3$, in this article we construct a class of non-linear $(n,n,q;d)$-MRD codes for any $ 2 \leq d \leq n-1$. A code $\mathcal{C}_{\sigma,T}$ of this class, where $1\in T \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ and $\sigma$ is a generator of $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}|\mathbb{F}_q)$, arises from a cone of $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q^n)$ with vertex an $(n-d-2)$-dimensional subspace over a maximum exterior set $\mathcal{E}$ with respect to $\Omega_{d-2}(\Gamma)$. We prove that the codes introduced in [Cossidente, A., Marino, G., Pavese, F.: Non-linear maximum rank distance codes. Des. Codes Cryptogr. 79, 597--609 (2016); Durante, N., Siciliano, A.: Non-linear maximum rank distance codes in the cyclic model for the field reduction of finite geometries. Electron. J. Comb.

Codes Cryptogr. 86, 1175--1184 (2018)] are appropriate punctured ones of $\mathcal{C}_{\sigma,T}$ and solve completely the inequivalence issue for this class showing that $\mathcal{C}_{\sigma,T}$ is neither equivalent nor adjointly equivalent to the non-linear MRD code $\mathcal{C}_{n,k,\sigma,I}$, $I \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$, obtained in [Otal, K., \"Ozbudak, F.: Some new non-additive maximum rank distance codes.

      <title>Distributed Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Multilayer Satellite Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless networks, in particular, 5G and beyond, are anticipated to deploy dense Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to provide global coverage and broadband connectivity. However, the limited frequency band and the coexistence of multiple constellations bring new challenges for interference management. In this paper, we propose a robust multilayer interference management scheme for spectrum sharing in heterogeneous satellite networks with statistical channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) and receivers (CSIR). In the proposed scheme, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), as a general and powerful framework for interference management and multiple access strategies, is implemented distributedly at GEO and LEO satellites, coined Distributed-RSMA (D-RSMA). By doing so, D-RSMA aims to mitigate the interference and boost the user fairness of the overall multilayer satellite system. Specifically, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the GEO/LEO precoders and message splits to maximize the minimum rate among User Terminals (UTs) subject to a transmit power constraint at all satellites. A robust algorithm is proposed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness towards network load and CSI uncertainty of our proposed D-RSMA scheme. Benefiting from the interference management capability, D-RSMA provides significant max-min fairness performance gains compared to several benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of low-weight codewords is critical to the performance of error-correcting codes. In 1970, Kasami and Tokura characterized the codewords of Reed-Muller (RM) codes whose weights are less than $2w_{\min}$, where $w_{\min}$ represents the minimum weight. In this paper, we extend their results to decreasing polar codes. We present the closed-form expressions for the number of codewords in decreasing polar codes with weights less than $2w_{\min}$. Moreover, the proposed enumeration algorithm runs in polynomial time with respect to the code length.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Generalized Decoding of Polar-like Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05004</link>

Abstract: We present a framework that can exploit the tradeoff between the undetected error rate (UER) and block error rate (BLER) of polar-like codes. It is compatible with all successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding methods and relies on a novel approximation that we call codebook probability. This approximation is based on an auxiliary distribution that mimics the dynamics of decoding algorithms following an SC decoding schedule. Simulation results demonstrates that, in the case of SC list (SCL) decoding, the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-art approximations from Forney's generalized decoding rule for polar-like codes with dynamic frozen bits. In addition, dynamic Reed-Muller (RM) codes using the proposed generalized decoding significantly outperform CRC-concatenated polar codes decoded using SCL in both BLER and UER. Finally, we briefly discuss three potential applications of the approximated codebook probability: coded pilot-free channel estimation; bitwise soft-output decoding; and improved turbo product decoding.</description>

      <title>Distributed Massive MIMO System with Dynamic Clustering in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) system for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is introduced as a promising technique to provide broadband connectivity. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in implementing distributed mMIMO systems for LEO satellite networks. These challenges include providing scalable massive access implementation as the system complexity increases with network size. Another challenging issue is the asynchronous arrival of signals at the user terminals due to the different propagation delays among distributed antennas in space, which destroys the coherent transmission, and consequently degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed mMIMO system for LEO satellite networks based on dynamic user-centric clustering. Aiming to obtain scalable implementation, new algorithms for initial cooperative access, cluster selection, and cluster handover are provided. In addition, phase shift-aware precoding is implemented to compensate for the propagation delay phase shifts. The performance of the proposed user-centric distributed mMIMO is compared with two baseline configurations: the non-cooperative transmission systems, where each user connects to only a single satellite, and the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems, where all satellites contribute serving each user. The numerical results show the potential of the proposed distributed mMIMO system to enhance system spectral efficiency when compared to noncooperative transmission systems. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to minimize the serving cluster size for each user, thereby reducing the overall system complexity in comparison to the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-leakage by R\'{e}nyi Divergence and Sibson Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper proposes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain measure. R\'{e}nyi divergence is shown to be the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain incurred at each elementary event $y$ of channel output $Y$ and Sibson mutual information is the $\tilde{f}$-mean of this $Y$-elementary information gain. Both are proposed as $\alpha$-leakage measures, indicating the most information an adversary can obtain on sensitive data. It is shown that the existing $\alpha$-leakage by Arimoto mutual information can be expressed as $\tilde{f}$-mean measures by a scaled probability. Further, Sibson mutual information is interpreted as the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain over all estimation decisions applied to channel output. This reveals that the exiting generalized Blahut-Arimoto method for computing R\'{e}nyi capacity (or Gallager's error exponent) in fact maximizes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain iteratively over estimation decision and channel input. This paper also derives a decomposition of $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain, analogous to the Sibson identity for R\'{e}nyi divergence.</description>

      <title>High-probability sample complexities for policy evaluation with linear function approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of policy evaluation with linear function approximation in discounted infinite horizon Markov decision processes. We investigate the sample complexities required to guarantee a predefined estimation error of the best linear coefficients for two widely-used policy evaluation algorithms: the temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm and the two-timescale linear TD with gradient correction (TDC) algorithm. In both the on-policy setting, where observations are generated from the target policy, and the off-policy setting, where samples are drawn from a behavior policy potentially different from the target policy, we establish the first sample complexity bound with high-probability convergence guarantee that attains the optimal dependence on the tolerance level. We also exhihit an explicit dependence on problem-related quantities, and show in the on-policy setting that our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound on crucial problem parameters, including the choice of the feature maps and the problem dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Non-Interactive Source Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the non-interactive source simulation problem (NISS). In the standard NISS scenario, a pair of distributed agents, Alice and Bob, observe a distributed binary memoryless source $(X^d,Y^d)$ generated based on joint distribution $P_{X,Y}$. The agents wish to produce a pair of discrete random variables $(U_d,V_d)$ with joint distribution $P_{U_d,V_d}$, such that $P_{U_d,V_d}$ converges in total variation distance to a target distribution $Q_{U,V}$. Two variations of the standard NISS scenario are considered. In the first variation, in addition to $(X^d,Y^d)$ the agents have access to a shared Bell state. The agents each measure their respective state, using a measurement of their choice, and use its classical output along with $(X^d,Y^d)$ to simulate the target distribution. This scenario is called the entanglement-assisted NISS (EA-NISS). In the second variation, the agents have access to a classical common random bit $Z$, in addition to $(X^d,Y^d)$. This scenario is called the classical common randomness NISS (CR-NISS). It is shown that for binary-output NISS scenarios, the set of feasible distributions for EA-NISS and CR-NISS are equal with each other. Hence, there is not quantum advantage in these EA-NISS scenarios. For non-binary output NISS scenarios, it is shown through an example that there are distributions that are feasible in EA-NISS but not in CR-NISS. This shows that there is a quantum advantage in non-binary output EA-NISS.</description>
