      <title>Dominic Welsh (1938-2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This biographical and scientific memoir of Dominic Welsh includes summaries of his important contributions to probability and combinatorics. With John Hammersley, he introduced first-passage percolation, and in so doing they formulated and proved the first subadditive ergodic theorem. Welsh has numerous results in matroid theory, and wrote the first monograph on the topic. He worked on computational complexity and particularly the complexity of computing the Tutte polynomial. He was an inspirational teacher and advisor who helped to develop a community of scholars in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. Finally, I briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of the MML functional quantizer modules for VCV Rack software synthesizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detail the mathematical formulation of the line of "functional quantizer" modules developed by the Mathematics and Music Lab (MML) at Michigan Technological University, for the VCV Rack software modular synthesizer platform, which allow synthesizer players to tune oscillators to new musical scales based on mathematical functions. For example, we describe the recently-released MML Logarithmic Quantizer (LOG QNT) module that tunes synthesizer oscillators to the non-Pythagorean musical scale introduced by indie band The Apples in Stereo.</description>
