      <title>Failures to Surface Harmful Contents in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.</description>

      <title>Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection, a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark potential applications of topological object detection.</description>

      <title>Empowering Multimodal LLMs with External Tools: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data, poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance. Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools: (1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities, offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

      <title>Advancing 3D Scene Understanding with MV-ScanQA Multi-View Reasoning Evaluation and TripAlign Pre-training Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M &lt;2D view, set of 3D objects, text&gt; triplets that explicitly aligns groups of contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering. Datasets and code are available at https://matthewdm0816.github.io/tripalign-mvscanqa.</description>

      <title>StyleMM: Stylized 3D Morphable Face Model via Text-Driven Aligned Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

      <title>Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</description>

      <title>MMESGBench: Pioneering Multimodal Understanding and Complex Reasoning Benchmark for ESG Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports are essential for evaluating sustainability practices, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting financial transparency. However, these documents are often lengthy, structurally diverse, and multimodal, comprising dense text, structured tables, complex figures, and layout-dependent semantics. Existing AI systems often struggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no dedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we introduce \textbf{MMESGBench}, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted to evaluate multimodal understanding and complex reasoning across structurally diverse and multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a human-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates candidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting rich textual, tabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an LLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of each QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop validation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure quality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs derived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types and three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as single-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained multimodal evidence. Initial experiments validate that multimodal and retrieval-augmented models substantially outperform text-only baselines, particularly on visually grounded and cross-page tasks. MMESGBench is publicly available as an open-source dataset at https://github.com/Zhanglei1103/MMESGBench.</description>

      <title>Mining the Social Fabric: Unveiling Communities for Fake News Detection in Short Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short video platforms have become a major medium for information sharing, but their rapid content generation and algorithmic amplification also enable the widespread dissemination of fake news. Detecting misinformation in short videos is challenging due to their multi-modal nature and the limited context of individual videos. While recent methods focus on analyzing content signals-visual, textual, and audio-they often overlook implicit relationships among videos, uploaders, and events. To address this gap, we propose DugFND (Dual-community graph for fake news detection), a novel method that enhances existing video classifiers by modeling two key community patterns: (1) uploader communities, where uploaders with shared interests or similar content creation patterns group together, and (2) event-driven communities, where videos related to the same or semantically similar public events form localized clusters. We construct a heterogeneous graph connecting uploader, video, and event nodes, and design a time-aware heterogeneous graph attention network to enable effective message passing. A reconstruction-based pretraining phase further improves node representation learning. DugFND can be applied to any pre-trained classifier. Experiments on public datasets show that our method achieves significant performance gains, demonstrating the value of dual-community modeling for fake news detection in short videos.</description>

      <title>Casual3DHDR: Deblurring High Dynamic Range 3D Gaussian Splatting from Casually Captured Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has gained significant attention for its superior performance. However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous-time camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \textbf{Casual3DHDR} outperforms existing methods in robustness and rendering quality. Our source code and dataset will be available at https://lingzhezhao.github.io/CasualHDRSplat/</description>

      <title>I$^3$-MRec: Invariant Learning with Information Bottleneck for Incomplete Modality Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by integrating complementary semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the assumption of complete multimodality rarely holds in practice due to missing images and incomplete descriptions, hindering model robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvairant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal representation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios, reducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly important. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn preference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module is developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential user preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing modality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.</description>
