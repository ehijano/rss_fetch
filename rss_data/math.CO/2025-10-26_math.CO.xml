      <title>On the Number of Exceptional Pairs Over a Class of Nakayama Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper some combinatorial and homological tools are used to describe and give an explicit formula for the number of exceptional pairs (exceptional sequences of length two) for some classes of Nakayama Algebras and for the Auslander algebra of a radical square zero algebra of type $\mathbb{A}_n$. In addition, we explore how the number of exceptional pairs can be connected with some integer sequences in the OEIS (The On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences).</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of C_4-free graphs from the set of closed neighborhoods and digital convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fomin, Kratochv\'il, Lokshtanov, Mancini, and Telle showed that every $C_{4}$-free graph is reconstructible from the \emph{multiset} of closed neighborhoods. We strengthen their result proving that every $C_{4}$-free graph is reconstructible from the \emph{set} of closed neighborhoods.
  This extends the work of Lafrance et al.\ by showing that all $C_{4}$-free graphs, and hence all graphs of girth at least five, are reconstructible from their digitally convex sets.
  A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is digitally convex if, for every vertex $v \notin S$, there is a private neighbor of $v$.
  We establish that reconstruction from digitally convex sets is equivalent to reconstruction from the set of closed neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Improved Gilbert-Varshamov bound for sum-rank-metric codes via graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a graph-theoretic approach which yields improvements on the known Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound for sum-rank-metric codes for certain parameters. In particular, we show that asymptotically $\mathbb{F}_q^{\mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{m}}$ can be partitioned into sum-rank-metric codes whose average size is bigger than the GV bound by a logarithmic factor for these parameters. Finally, we discuss the connection of such codes to set-coloring Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Sandwiching between random regular graphs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs: configuration model and unions of perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new couplings among several random graph and multigraph models related to the random regular graph $G(n,d)$, including the configuration model and unions of random perfect matchings. As a main result, we verify the Kim-Vusandwich conjecture for all large degrees $d=n-O(\log^4 n)$ and prove a weakened version for $d=O(\log^4 n)$, which are the only remaining open cases. Our approach introduces a coupling framework that links $G(n,d)$ and $G(n,p)$ through a chain of intermediate models.</description>

      <title>Assignment-Routing Optimization : Efficient Heuristic Solver with Shaking Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper works on heuristic solver for joint assignment and routing optimization problem. Study on previous works shows that MIP based exact solvers can only provide efficient solutions for small to moderate size problems, due to exponentially growing computational complexity. This paper proposes to start with high quality initial guess through Hungarian algorithm based assignment and heuristic cycle merging algorithm. Subsequently, the solution is improved based on a proposed shaking algorithm to improve the assignment and routing sequence. In addition, the shaking approach also enables the Simulated Annealing algorithm to further improve the solution, which is very difficult if it is purely based on random sampling updates of item and placeholder sequences. Extensive experimental validation comparing with ground truth from the previously shared database shows that the introduced solver is much more efficient than the Gurobi solver especially for large size problems, with a 1000 node pair problem being solved within 1 min in Python implementation. The solution accuracy is within a percent in general as compared with ground truth in database. Although there are spaces for the proposed solver to be further improved with better accuracy, it works for practical applications with acceptable path quality and sufficient solver efficiency. Such shaking algorithms based solvers can also be applied to more general joint assignment and routing optimization problem with multiple type of items and corresponding placeholders.

      <title>Transformation of Third Order Mock Theta Functions and New $q$-Series Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan introduced mock theta functions in his last letter to G.H.Hardy. He provided examples and various relations between them. G.N.Watson found transformations for the third order mock theta functions $f(q)$ and $\omega$(q). Zwegers in 2000 built on Watson's techniques to complete these mock theta functions and connected them to real analytic modular forms. We show how to derive these transformations using Lerch sums. To show the equivalence of the results involves some new $q$-series identities thus resulting in a new proof of Zwegers' theorem.</description>

      <title>Weingarten calculus with virtual isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices via sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$ through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. Several examples and applications are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Grassmannians of sub-bimodules over the path algebras of quivers. Our quiver Grassmannians include Escobar's brick manifolds as well as Labelle's generalizations. We give an explicit construction of the varieties in question, provide examples and clarify connection with the quiver representation spaces. We also prove smoothness of our Grassmannians, construct cellular decompositions and derive a realization as framed moduli spaces. The framed moduli realization leads to a recursive formula for the motives.</description>

      <title>Products of Chern Classes and Chern Numbers on the Permutohedral Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A root system $\Phi$ of rank $n$ determines an $n$-dimensional smooth projective toric variety $X(\Phi)$ associated with the fan of its Weyl chambers. For the root system of type $A_n$, this variety is the well-known permutohedral variety $X_{A_n}$. Using purely combinatorial methods, we obtain an explicit closed formula expressing the product of Chern classes $c_k c_{n-k}$ as a multiple of the top Chern class $c_n$ in the rational cohomology ring $H^*(X_{A_n};\mathbb{Q})$. The resulting coefficient, which depends only on $k$ and $n$, is given by a closed-form expression. As an application, we compute the Chern number $\langle c_k c_{n-k}, [X_{A_n}] \rangle$.</description>

      <title>Integrals of stable envelopes for cotangent bundles to Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider cohomological stable envelopes for a natural torus action $\mathsf{T}$ on $X=T^*Gr(k,n)$, introduced by Maulik-Okounkov. We define the $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar$-equivariant integral of the stable envelope using equivariant localization over the subtorus $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar\subset\mathsf{T}$, and compute the integral as a non-equivariant limit of the localization over the full torus, $\mathsf{T}$. The integral of such a class is an integer times a power of $\hbar$, and the main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for these integers. In 3d mirror symmetry, these non-equivariant limits are expected to reflect some curve counting phenomena on the 3d mirror dual, $X^\vee$. When $k=1$, we obtain the binomial coefficients, and we study some of the combinatorics of the integers for higher $k$, which haven't appeared in the literature before. We give some conjectures and interpretations on extending this phenomena to type A quiver and bow varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum difference equation (QDE) for equivariant quantum K-theory of the Grassmannian. In this paper we obtain a solution to the QDE and use the solution to asymptotically derive the Bethe ansatz equations. In the limit, we obtain similar results for the cohomological analogue. For both cases, we describe the nonequivariant solutions as well. As an application, we identify the quantum K-theory ring of $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$ with a quantum 5 vertex XXZ integrable spin chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geodesic cover, also known as an isometric path cover, of a graph is a set of geodesics which cover the vertex set of the graph. An edge geodesic cover of a graph is a set of geodesics which cover the edge set of the graph. The geodesic (edge) cover number of a graph is the cardinality of a minimum (edge) geodesic cover. The (edge) geodesic cover problem of a graph is to find the (edge) geodesic cover number of the graph. Surprisingly, only partial solutions for these problems are available for most situations. In this paper we demonstrate that the geodesic cover number of the $r$-dimensional butterfly is $\lceil (2/3)2^r\rceil$ and that its edge geodesic cover number is $2^r$.</description>

      <title>Submodular functions, generalized permutahedra, conforming preorders, and cointeracting bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular functions $z$ defined on the power set of a finite set are in bijection with generalized permutahedra $\egp(z)$. To any such $z$ we define a class of preorders, {\it conforming} preorders. We show the faces of $\egp(z)$ and the conforming preorders are in bijection. We investigate in detail this interplay between submodular functions and generalized permutahedra on one side, and conforming preorders on the other side, with many examples. In particular, the face poset structure of $\egp(z)$ correspond to two order relations $\lhd$ and $\btl$ on preorders, and we investigate their properties.
  Ardila and Aguiar \cite{AA2017} introduced a Hopf monoid of submodular functions/generalized permutahedra. We show there is a bimonoid of modular functions cointeracting in a non-standard way. By recent theory of L.Foissy \cite{Fo2022}, on double bialgebras we get a canonical polynomial associated to any submodular function.</description>

      <title>On cycles in monotone grid classes of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed investigation into the structure of permutations in monotone grid classes whose row-column graphs do not contain components with more than one cycle. Central to this investigation is a new decomposition, called the $M$-sum, which generalises the well-known notions of direct sum and skew sum, and enables a deeper understanding of the structure of permutations in these grid classes. Permutations which are indecomposable with respect to the $M$-sum play a crucial role in the structure of a grid class and of its subclasses, and this leads us to identify coils, a certain kind of permutation which corresponds to repeatedly traversing a chosen cycle in a particular manner.
  Harnessing this analysis, we give a precise characterisation for when a subclass of such a grid class is labelled well quasi-ordered, and we extend this to characterise (unlabelled) well quasi-ordering in certain cases. We prove that a large general family of these grid classes are finitely based, but we also exhibit other examples that are not, thereby disproving a conjecture from 2006 due to Huczynska and Vatter.</description>

Abstract: We give a counting formula in terms of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials and the chromatic quasisymmetric function for the number of points on an arbitrary Hessenberg variety over a finite field. As a consequence, we express the Poincar\'e polynomials of complex Hessenberg varieties in terms of a Hall scalar product involving the symmetric functions above. We use these results to give a new proof of a combinatorial formula for the modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting The R\'{e}dei-Berge Symmetric Functions via Matrix Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the R\'{e}dei-Berge symmetric function $\mathcal{U}_D$ for digraphs $D$, a specialization of Chow's path-cycle symmetric function. Through the lens of matrix algebra, we consolidate and expand on the work of Chow, Grinberg and Stanley, and Lass concerning the resolution of $\mathcal{U}_D$ in the power sum and Schur bases. Along the way we also revisit various results on Hamiltonian paths in digraphs.</description>

      <title>The Wiener index of vertex colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wiener index of a vertex coloring of a graph is defined to be the sum of all pairwise geodesic distances between vertices of the same color. We provide characterizations of vertex colorings of paths and cycles whose Wiener index is as large as possible over various natural collections. Along the way we establish a connection between the majorization order on tuples of integers and the Wiener index of vertex colorings on paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>The Ehrhart polynomial of a matroid specializes to the beta invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the linear coefficient of the Ehrhart polynomial of a matroid base polytope evaluated at $t-1$ is equal to, up to normalization, the $\beta$-invariant of the matroid. This yields a lattice-point counting formula for the $\beta$-invariant and establishes a new and unexpected positivity property of Ehrhart polynomials of matroid polytopes.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the (signed) chromatic polynomial coefficients via hyperplane arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent result of Lofano and Paolini expresses the characteristic polynomial of a real hyperplane arrangement in terms of a projection statistic on the regions of the arrangement. We use this result to give an alternative proof for Greene and Zaslavsky's interpretation for the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial of a graph and further generalize this interpretation to signed graphs. We also show that this projection statistic has a nice combinatorial interpretation in the case of the braid arrangement, which generalizes to graphical arrangements of natural unit interval graphs.</description>

      <title>Polynomial bounds for pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel conjectured that for a hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$, if there is some function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$ with clique number $\omega(G)$ has treewidth at most $f(\omega(G))$, then there is a polynomial function $f$ with the same property. Chudnovsky and Trotignon refuted this conjecture in a strong sense, showing that neither polynomial nor any prescribed growth can be guaranteed in general. Here we prove that, in stark contrast, the analog of the Dallard-Milani\v{c}-\v{S}torgel conjecture for pathwidth is true: For every hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$, if the pathwidth of every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is bounded by some function of its clique number, then the pathwidth of every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is bounded by a polynomial function of its clique number.</description>

      <title>Rational Exponents for Generalized Tur\'an Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number $\text{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph which contains no copies of any graph in a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs. The generalized rational exponents conjecture states that for every rational $r\geq 1$ there exist graphs $H,F$ such that $\text{ex}(n,H,\{F\})=\Theta(n^r)$. We extend a result of Bukh and Conlon to show that for every non-empty graph $H$ on $v\geq 2$ vertices and every rational $r$ in the interval $[v-1,v]$ there exists a finite family $\mathcal{F}_r$ such that $\text{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F}_r)=\Theta(n^r)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-partition of an $n$-set $X$ is a collection of $k$ pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets whose union is $X$. A family of $k$-partitions of $X$ is called $t$-intersecting if any two of its members share at least $t$ blocks. A $t$-intersecting family is trivial if every $k$-partition in it contains $t$ fixed blocks, and is non-trivial otherwise. In this paper, we first prove that, for $n\geq L(k,t):=(t+1)+(k-t+1)\cdot\log_2(t+1)(k-t+1)$, a $t$-intersecting family with maximum size must consist of all $k$-partitions containing $t$ fixed singletons. This improves the results given by Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'{e}kely (2000), and by Kupavskii (2023). We further determine the non-trivial $t$-intersecting families of $k$-partitions with maximum size for $n \ge 2L(k,t)$, which turn out to be natural analogs of the corresponding families for finite sets. In addition, we prove a stability result.</description>

      <title>The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Totally proper quivers, introduced by S.~Fomin and the author arXiv:2406.03604, have many useful properties including powerful mutation invariants. We show that every mutation-acyclic quiver (i.e., a quiver that is mutation equivalent to an acyclic one) is totally proper. This yields new necessary conditions for a quiver to be mutation-acyclic. In particular, we show that a generalization of the Markov invariant for $3$-vertex quivers applies to all mutation-acyclic quivers. Only finitely many acyclic quivers share the same Markov invariant.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r&gt;1$, a random $2r$--regular Schreier graph associated with the action of $r$ uniformly random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ has a near--optimal spectral gap with high probability, provided $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{20}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random permutations in irreducible representations of quasi--exponential dimension.
  Along the way, we give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(\frac{1}{\dim\chi^{\mu}}\right)=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem on a well-known generalization of interval and circular-arc graphs: the class of $H$-graphs, for any fixed multigraph $H$. In particular, we research how the parameterized complexity differs between two subclasses of $H$-graphs: proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs, each generalizing proper interval graphs and proper circular-arc graphs. We first generalize a known result of Bonnet et al. (IPEC 2022) from interval graphs to $H$-graphs, for any (simple) forest $H$, by showing that for such $H$, the class of $H$-graphs is delineated. This implies that for every hereditary subclass ${\cal D}$ of $H$-graphs, FO Model Checking is in FPT if ${\cal D}$ has bounded twin-width and AW[$*$]-hard otherwise. As proper claw-graphs have unbounded twin-width, this means that FO Model Checking is AW[$*$]-hard for proper $H$-graphs for certain forests $H$ like the claw. In contrast, we show that even for every multigraph $H$, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness and hence bounded twin-width, and thus FO Model Checking is in FPT on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. It is known that a special case of FO Model Checking, Independent Set, is $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard on $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$, where $k$ is the size of a solution. We strengthen this $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hardness result to proper $H$-graphs. Hence, we solve, in two different ways, an open problem of Chaplick (Discrete Math. 2023), who asked about problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Jin, Liu, and Xia \cite{JLX} presented some modulo 4 congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$, the number of smallest parts in the overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest part is even and is not overlined. In this paper, we extend the list of such congruences in two directions. First, we prove some new individual congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$. Then, we provide a number of infinite families of Ramanujan-like congruences satisfied by $\overline{spt2}(n)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the d-dimensional non-degenerate quadric hypersurface of characteristic p &gt; 2 is a rational function of p composed from the Ehrhart polynomials of integer polytopes. In consequence, we prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics of fixed characteristic is a decreasing function of dimension and recover results of Trivedi and Gessel-Monsky on the behaviour of said Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity as a function of characteristic.</description>

      <title>Partition functions that repel perfect-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conjecture by Sun states that the partition function $p(n)$, for $n&gt;1$, is never a perfect power. Recent work by Merca et al. proposes generalizations of perfect-power repulsion for $p(n)$. In this note, we prove these generalizations for the functions $p_B(n)$, which count the number of partitions of $n$ with the largest part $\leq B$. If $B\geq 4$ and $k\geq 3$, with $k\nmid (B-1)$, then we prove that there are only finitely many pairs $(n,m)$ for which $$\lvert p_B(n)-m^k\rvert\le d.$$ These results support Sun and Merca et al.'s conjectures, as $p_B(n) \rightarrow p(n)$ when $B \rightarrow +\infty.$ To prove this, we reduce the problem to Siegel's Theorem, which guarantees the finiteness of integral points on curves with genus $\geq 1$.</description>

Abstract: U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the main analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy. By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a Berry-Esseen bound valid for incomplete U-statistics of deterministic designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be established even in degenerate cases and when the order diverges. We also introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain cases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to kernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. In a real data example with the CIFAR-10 dataset, our permutation-free MMD test delivers substantial computational gains while retaining power and type I error control.</description>
