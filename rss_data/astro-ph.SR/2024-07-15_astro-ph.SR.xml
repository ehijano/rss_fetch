      <title>The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) is a solar-gazing spectrograph scheduled to fly in the summer of 2025 on a NASA sounding rocket. Its goal is to view the solar chromosphere and transition region at a high cadence (1s) both spatially (0.5") and spectrally (33 m{\AA}) viewing wavelengths around Lyman Alpha (1216 {\AA}), Si iii (1206 {\AA}) and O v (1218 {\AA}) to observe spicules, nanoflares, and possibly a solar flare. This time cadence will provide yet-unobserved detail about fast-changing features of the Sun. The instrument is comprised of a Gregorian-style reflecting telescope combined with a spectrograph via a specialized mirrorlet array that focuses the light from each spatial location in the image so that it may be spectrally dispersed without overlap from neighboring locations. This paper discusses the driving science, detailed instrument and subsystem design, and pre-integration testing of the SNIFS instrument.</description>

      <title>Estimation of projection effects in polar manetic field measurements from the ecliptic view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution and evolution of the magnetic field at the solar poles through a solar cycle is an important parameter in understanding the solar dynamo. The accurate observations of the polar magnetic flux is very challenging from the ecliptic view, mainly due to (a) geometric foreshortening which limits the spatial resolution, and (b) the oblique view of predominantly vertical magnetic flux elements, which presents rather small line-of-sight component of the magnetic field towards the ecliptic. Due to these effects the polar magnetic flux is poorly measured. Depending upon the measurement technique, longitudinal versus full vector field measurement, where the latter is extremely sensitive to the SNR achieved and azimuth disamiguation problem, the polar magnetic flux measurements could be underestimated or overestimated. To estimate the extent of systematic errors in magetic flux measurements at the solar poles due to aforementioned projection effects we use MHD simulations of quiet sun network as a reference solar atmosphere. Using the numerical model of the solar atmosphere we simulate the observations from the ecliptic as well as from out-of-ecliptic vantage points, such as from a solar polar orbit at various heliographic latitudes. Using these simulated observations we make an assessment of the systematic errors in our measurements of the magnetic flux due to projection effects and the extent of under- or over estimation. We suggest that such effects could contribute to reported missing open magnetic flux in the heliosphere and that the multi-viewpoint observations from out-of-the-ecliptic plane together with innovative Compact Doppler Magnetographs provide the best bet for the future measurements.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis near the transition of the large-scale dynamo in the presence of the small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Sun and solar-type stars, there is a critical dynamo number for the operation of a large-scale dynamo, below which the dynamo ceases to operate. This region is known as the subcritical region. Previous studies showed the possibility of operating the solar-like large-scale (global) dynamo in the subcritical region without a small-scale dynamo. As in the solar convection zone, both large- and small-scale dynamos are expected to operate at the same time and location, we check the robustness of the previously identified subcritical dynamo branch in a numerical model in which both large- and small-scale dynamos are excited. For this, we use the {\sc Pencil Code} and set up an $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo model with uniform shear and helically forced turbulence. We have performed a few sets of simulations at different relative helicity to explore the generation of large-scale oscillatory fields in the presence of small-scale dynamo. We find that in some parameter regimes, the dynamo shows hysteresis behavior, i.e., two dynamo solutions are possible depending on the initial parameters used. A decaying solution when the dynamo was started with a weak field and a strong oscillatory solution if the dynamo was initialized with a strong field. Thus, the existence of the sub-critical branch of the large-scale dynamo in the presence of small-scale dynamo is established. However, the regime of hysteresis is quite narrow with respect to the case without the small-scale dynamo. Our work supports the possible existence of large-scale dynamo in the sub-critical regime of slowly rotating stars.</description>

      <title>The JWST Weather Report from the Nearest Brown Dwarfs I: multi-period JWST NIRSpec + MIRI monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from 8 hours of JWST/MIRI LRS spectroscopic monitoring directly followed by 7 hours of JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopic monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. We find water, methane, and CO absorption features in both components, including the 3.3 $\mu$m methane absorption feature and a tentative detection of small grain ($&lt;$ 1$\mu$m) silicate absorption at $&gt;$8.5 $\mu$m in WISE 1049A. Both components vary significantly ($&gt;$1$\%$), with WISE 1049B displaying larger variations than WISE 1049A. Using K-means clustering, we find three main transition points in wavelength for both components of the binary: 1) change in behavior at $\sim$2.3 $\mu$m coincident with a CO absorption bandhead, 2) change in behavior at 4.2 $\mu$m, close to the CO fundamental band at $\lambda &gt;$ 4.4 $\mu$m, and 3) change in behavior at 8.3-8.5 $\mu$m, potentially corresponding to silicate absorption. We interpret the lightcurves observed with both NIRSpec and MIRI as likely stemming from 1) a deep pressure level driving the double-peaked variability seen in WISE 1049B at wavelengths $&lt;$2.3 $\mu$m and $&gt;$8.5 $\mu$m, 2) an intermediate pressure level shaping the lightcurve morphology between 2.3 and 4.2 $\mu$m, and 3) a higher-altitude pressure level producing single-peaked and plateaued lightcurve behavior between 4.2 and 8.5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Testing volume integrals of travel-time sensitivity kernels for flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Helioseismic inversions rely largely on sensitivity kernels, 3-D spatial functions describing how do the changes in the solar interior translate into the changes of helioseismic observables. These sensitivity kernels come in most cases from the forward modelling utilising state-of-the-art solar models.
  Aims: We aim to test the sensitivity kernels by comparing their volume integrals with measured values from helioseismic travel times.
  Methods: By manipulating the tracking rate, we mimic the additional zonal velocity present in the Dopplergram datacubes. These datacubes are then processed by a standard travel-time measurements pipeline. We investigate the dependence of the east--west travel time averaged over a box around the disc centre on the implanted tracking velocity. The slope of this dependence is directly proportional to the total volume integral of the sensitivity kernel corresponding to the used travel-time geometry.
  Results: We find a very good to acceptable agreement between measurements and models for travel times with ridge filtering applied. The sought dependence indeed resembles a linear function and the slope of it agrees with the expected volume integral from the forward-modelled sensitivity kernel. The agreement is less optimistic for the phase-speed filtered datacubes. A disagreement is particularly large for smallest phase speeds (filters td1--td4), for the larger phase speeds, our result indicate that the measured kernel integrals are systematically larger than expected from the forward modelling. We admit that for large phase-speeds and higher radial modes our testing procedure does not have to be appropriate.</description>

      <title>An impulsive geomagnetic effect from an early-impulsive flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geomagnetic "solar flare effect" (SFE) results from excess ionization in the Earth's ionosphere, famously first detected at the time of the Carrington flare in 1859. This indirect detection of a flare constituted one of the first cases of "multimessenger astronomy," whereby solar ionizing radiation stimulates ionospheric currents. Well-observed SFEs have few-minute time scales and perturbations of &gt;10 nT, with the greatest events reaching above 100 nT. In previously reported cases the SFE time profiles tend to resemble those of solar soft X-ray emission, which ionizes the D-region; there is also a less-well-studied contribution from Lyman-alpha. We report here a specific case, from flare SOL2024-03-10 (M7.4), in which an impulsive SFE deviated from this pattern. This flare contained an "early impulsive" component of exceptionally hard radiation, extending up to gamma-ray energies above 1 MeV, distinctly before the bulk of the flare soft X-ray emission. We can characterize the spectral distribution of this early-impulsive component in detail, thanks to the modern extensive wavelength coverage. A more typical gradual SFE occurred during the flare's main phase. We suggest that events of this type warrant exploration of the solar physics in the "impulse response" limit of very short time scales.</description>

      <title>SynCOM: An Empirical Model for High-Resolution Simulations of Transient Solar Wind Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Synthetic Corona Outflow Model (SynCOM), an empirical model, simulates the solar corona's dynamics to match high-resolution observations, providing a useful resource for testing velocity measurement algorithms. SynCOM generates synthetic images depicting radial variability in polarized brightness and includes stochastic elements for plasma outflows and instrumental noise. It employs a predefined flow velocity probability distribution and an adjustable signal-to-noise ratio to evaluate different data analysis methods for coronal flows. By adjusting parameters to match specific coronal and instrumental conditions, SynCOM offers a platform to assess these methods for determining coronal velocity and acceleration. Validating these measurements would help to understand solar wind origins and support missions such as the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH). In this study, we demonstrate how SynCOM can be employed to assess the precision and performance of two different flow tracking methods. By providing a ground-truth based on observational data, we highlight the importance of SynCOM in confirming observational standards for detecting coronal flows.</description>

      <title>Flow-Based Generative Emulation of Grids of Stellar Evolutionary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions. Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.</description>

      <title>How coronal mass ejections are influenced by the morphology and toroidal flux of their source magnetic flux ropes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) stand as intense eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun, playing a pivotal role in driving significant changes of the heliospheric environment. Deducing the properties of CMEs from their progenitors in solar source regions is crucial for space weather forecasting. Deducing the properties of CMEs from their progenitors in solar source regions is crucial for space weather forecasting. The primary objective of this paper is to establish a connection between CMEs and their progenitors in solar source regions, enabling us to infer the magnetic structures of CMEs before their full development. To this end, we create a dataset comprising a magnetic flux rope series with varying projection shapes, sizes and toroidal fluxes, using the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL). Thereafter, we simulate the propagation of these flux ropes from the solar surface to a distance of 25$R_{\odot}$ with our global coronal MHD model which is named COCONUT. Our parametric survey reveals significant impacts of source flux ropes on the consequent CMEs. We find that the projection shape can influence the magnetic structures of CMEs at 20$R_{\odot}$, albeit with minimal impacts on the propagation speed. However, these impacts diminish as source flux ropes become fat. In terms of toroidal flux, our simulation results demonstrate a pronounced correlation with the propagation speed of CMEs, as well as the successfulness in erupting. This work builds the bridge between the CMEs in the outer corona and their progenitors in solar source regions. Our parametric survey suggests that the projection shape, cross-section radius and toroidal flux of source flux ropes are crucial parameters in predicting magnetic structures and propagation speed of CMEs, providing valuable insights for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>JADES: Spectroscopic Confirmation and Proper Motion for a T-Dwarf at 2 Kiloparsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800-900K (T5 - T6) at a distance of $1.8 - 2.3$kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] $\leq -0.5$). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of $20 \pm 4$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (a transverse velocity of 214 km s$^{-1}$ at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.</description>

      <title>A grid of self-consistent MSG (MARCS-StaticWeather-GGchem) cool stellar, sub-stellar, and exoplanetary model atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation of a grid of self consistent 1D model atmospheres of cool stars, sub-stellar objects and exoplanets in the effective temperature range 300K to 3000K, including cloud formation, chemical non-equilibrium effects, and stellar irradiation.
  The models are called MSG, because they are based on an iterative coupling between three well tested codes, the MARCS stellar atmosphere code, the StaticWeather cloud formation code and the GGchem chemical equilibrium code. It includes up-to-date molecular and atomic opacities, cloud formation and advanced chemical equilibrium calculations, and involves new numerical methods at low temperatures to allow robust convergence.
  The coupling between the MARCS radiative transfer and GGchem chemical equilibrium computations has made it possibly effectively to reach convergence based on electron pressure for the warmer models and gas pressure for the cooler models, enabling self-consistent modelling of stellar, sub-stellar and exoplanetary objects in a very wide range of effective temperatures. Here we describe the basic details of the models, with illustrative examples of cloudy and irradiated models as well as models based on non-equilibrium chemistry.
  The qualitative changes in the relative abundances of TiO, H2O, CH4, NH3, and other molecules in our models follow the observationally defined M, L, T (and Y) sequences, but reveal more complex and depth dependent abundance changes, and therefore a spectral classification depending on more parameters. The self consistent coupling to Static-Weather cloud computations, allows detailed comparison between nucleation and observed relative dimming of different spectral bands, with advanced applications for new identification methods of potential exoplanetary biology.</description>

Abstract: We propagate relativistic test particles in the field of a steady three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code for the wind simulations and integrate the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order accurate predictor-corrector time integration scheme. Turbulence induced scattering of the particles' trajectory in velocity space is mimicked by a constant magnetic field aligned mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$. We comment the particular case of $81\:{\rm keV}$ electrons injected in the solar wind at 0.139 AU heliocentric distance and $24^{\circ}$ of magnetic latitude. For $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$, the simulated velocity pitch angle distributions are in good qualitative agreement with in situ measurements at 1 AU. More generally, for $\lambda_\parallel$ in the range 0.5 to 3\:AU, a velocity drift associated energy loss rate of the order of $10\%$ per day is observed. The energy loss is attributable to the magnetic curvature and gradient induced poleward drifts of the electrons, against the dominant component of the electric field.</description>

      <title>A population of neutron star candidates in wide orbits from Gaia astrometry</title>

Abstract: We report discovery and spectroscopic follow-up of 21 astrometric binaries containing solar-type stars and dark companions with masses near 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The simplest interpretation is that the companions are dormant neutron stars (NSs), though ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs) and tight WD+WD binaries cannot be fully excluded. We selected targets from Gaia DR3 astrometric binary solutions in which the luminous star is on the main sequence and the dynamically-implied mass of the unseen companion is (a) more than $1.25\,M_{\odot}$ and (b) too high to be any non-degenerate star or close binary. We obtained multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) over a period of 700 days, spanning a majority of the orbits' dynamic range in RV. The RVs broadly validate the astrometric solutions and significantly tighten constraints on companion masses. Several systems have companion masses that are unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit, while the rest have masses between 1.25 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The orbits are significantly more eccentric at fixed period than those of typical WD + MS binaries, perhaps due to natal kicks. Metal-poor stars are overrepresented in the sample: 3 out of 21 objects (14%) have [Fe/H]$\sim-1.5$ and are on halo orbits, compared to $\sim$0.5% of the parent Gaia binary sample. The metal-poor stars are all strongly enhanced in lithium. The formation history of these objects is puzzling: it is unclear both how the binaries escaped a merger or dramatic orbital shrinkage when the NS progenitors were red supergiants, and how they remained bound when the NSs formed. Gaia has now discovered 3 black holes (BHs) in astrometric binaries with masses above 9 $M_{\odot}$, and 21 NSs with masses near $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. The lack of intermediate-mass objects in this sample is striking, supporting the existence of a BH/NS mass bimodality over 4 orders of magnitude in orbital period.</description>

      <title>M3DIS -- A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale stellar surveys, such as SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE, and PLATO, require accurate atmospheric models and synthetic spectra of stars for accurate analyses of fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The primary goal of our work is to develop a new approach to solve radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) and generate model stellar spectra in a self-consistent and highly efficient framework. We build upon the Copenhagen legacy RHD code, the MULTI3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) code, and the DISPATCH high-performance framework. The new approach allows us to calculate 3D RHD models of stellar atmospheres on timescales of a few thousand CPU hours and to perform subsequent spectrum synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or NLTE for the desired physical conditions within the parameter space of FGK-type stars. We compare the 3D RHD solar model with other available models and validate its performance against solar observations, including the centre-to-limb variation of intensities and key solar diagnostic lines of H and Fe. We show that the performance of the new code allows to overcome the main bottleneck in 3D NLTE spectroscopy and enables calculations of multi-dimensional grids of synthetic stellar observables for comparison with modern astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Properties of observable mixed inertial and gravito-inertial modes in {\gamma} Doradus stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In {\gamma} Doradus stars, gravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and inertial modes in the convective core can interact resonantly, which translates into the appearance of dip structures in the period spacing of modes. Those dips are information-rich, as they are related to the star core characteristics. Our aim is to characterise these dips according to stellar properties and thus to develop new seismic diagnostic tools to constrain the internal structure of {\gamma} Doradus stars, especially their cores. We used the two-dimensional oscillation code TOP to compute sectoral prograde and axisymmetric dipolar modes in {\gamma} Doradus stars at different rotation rates and evolutionary stages. We then characterised the dips we obtained by their width and location on the period spacing diagram. We found that the width and the location of the dips depend quasi-linearly on the ratio of the rotation rate and the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency at the core interface. This allowed us to determine empirical relations between the width and location of dips as well as the resonant inertial mode frequency in the core and the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency at the interface between the convective core and the radiative zone. We propose an approximate theoretical model to support and discuss these empirical relations. The empirical relations we established could be applied to dips observed in data, which would allow for the estimation of frequencies of resonant inertial modes in the core and of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a jump at the interface between the core and the radiative zone. As those two parameters are both related to the evolutionary stage of the star, their determination could lead to more accurate estimations of stellar ages.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground-state hydrogen atom, and their astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present explicit expressions for Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground $1s$ state hydrogen atom based on the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula. The Rayleigh scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in the ground-state while the Raman scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in either $ns$ ($n\geq2$; $s$-branch) or $nd$ ($n\geq3$; $d$-branch) excited state, and the Raman scattering converts incident ultraviolet (UV) photons around the Lyman resonance lines into optical-infrared (IR) photons. We show that this Raman wavelength conversion of incident flat UV continuum in dense hydrogen gas with a column density of $N_{\text{H}} &gt; 10^{21}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ can produce broad emission features centred at Balmer, Paschen, and higher-level lines, which would mimic Doppler-broadened hydrogen lines with the velocity width of $\gtrsim 1,000~\text{km}~\text{s}^{-1}$ that could be misinterpreted as signatures of Active Galactic Nuclei, supernovae, or fast stellar winds. We show that the phase matrix of the Rayleigh and Raman $s$-branch scatterings is identical to that of the Thomson scattering while the Raman $d$-branch scattering is more isotropic, thus the Paschen and higher-level Raman features are depolarized compared to the Balmer features due to the flux contribution from the Raman $d$-branch. We argue that observations of the line widths, line flux ratios, and linear polarization of multiple optical/IR hydrogen lines are crucial to discriminate between the Raman-scattered broad emission features and Doppler-broadened emission lines.</description>

      <title>Free-Floating Planets, Survivor Planets, Captured Planets and Binary Planets from Stellar Flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study on the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system experiences flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving-planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs as a function of the pericenter distance of the flyby, and use them to derive analytical expressions for the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar (for initial planet semi-major axis ratio $a_1/a_2=0.6-0.8$), while the rate for CPs is a few times smaller. The formation fraction of BPs depends strongly on $a_1/a_2$ and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than $1\%$ (for $a_1/a_2=0.8$) and typically much smaller ($\lesssim 0.2\%$ for $a_1/a_2\lesssim 0.7$). The fraction remains less than $1\%$ when considering $4M_{\rm J}$ planets. Overall, when averaging over all flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than $0.1\%$ of that for FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital parameter distributions of SSPs, CPs and BPs. These results can be used in future studies of exotic planets (including FFPs) and planetary systems.</description>
