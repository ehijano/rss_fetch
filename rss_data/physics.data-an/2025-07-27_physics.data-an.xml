      <title>Quantifying Coupled Dynamics in Phase-Space from State Distribution Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify nonlinear interactions between coupled complex processes, when the system is subject to noise and not all its components are measurable. Our method is applicable even when the system cannot be continuously monitored over time, but is rather observed only in snapshots. Having only partial information about the local topology of the network and observations of relevant interacting variables is sufficient to translate qualitative knowledge of interactions into a quantitative characterization of the coupled dynamics. This approach turns a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable inference problems, to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete snapshots of their statistical state.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Synergy in Adaptive Active Learning for Continuous Lithium Carbonate Crystallization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.</description>

      <title>Theoretical correction methods for optical tweezers: Acquisition of potentials of mean forces between colloidal particles in a bulk and on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10722v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that line optical tweezers (LOT) can measure potential of mean force (PMF) between colloidal particles in the bulk. However, PMF obtained with LOT is empirically modified before showing the result of the final form in order to correct the potential rise at long distances. In the present letter, we derive theoretical correction methods for acquisition of PMF by using statistical mechanics. Using the new methods, PMF can be obtained without the empirical fitting equation. Through the new methods, external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles induced by LOT can also be obtained. As an additional study, we explain two methods for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles on a substrate surface, in which a normal single optical tweezers with a fixed focal point is used, and for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles trapped by dual-beam optical tweezers in the bulk. These methods can also obtain the external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles.</description>
