      <title>Rel-UNet: Reliable Tumor Segmentation via Uncertainty Quantification in nnU-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable tumor segmentation is essential in medical imaging analysis for improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. However, existing segmentation models often lack robust mechanisms for quantifying the uncertainty associated with their predictions, which is essential for informed clinical decision-making. This study presents a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in kidney tumor segmentation using deep learning, specifically leveraging multiple local minima during training. Our method generates uncertainty maps without modifying the original model architecture or requiring extensive computational resources. We evaluated our approach on the KiTS23 dataset, where our approach effectively identified ambiguous regions faster and with lower uncertainty scores in contrast to previous approaches. The generated uncertainty maps provide critical insights into model confidence, ultimately enhancing the reliability of the segmentation with the potential to support more accurate medical diagnoses. The computational efficiency and model-agnostic design of the proposed approach allows adaptation without architectural changes, enabling use across various segmentation models.</description>

      <title>4D-ACFNet: A 4D Attention Mechanism-Based Prognostic Framework for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis Integrating Multimodal Spatiotemporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postoperative prognostic prediction for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the hepatic microenvironment, and insufficient multimodal data fusion. To address these issues, we propose 4D-ACFNet, the first framework that synergistically integrates lightweight spatiotemporal modeling, cross-modal dynamic calibration, and personalized temporal prediction within a unified architecture. Specifically, it incorporates a novel 4D spatiotemporal attention mechanism, which employs spatiotemporal separable convolution (reducing parameter count by 41%) and virtual timestamp encoding to model the interannual evolution patterns of postoperative dynamic processes, such as liver regeneration and steatosis. For cross-modal feature alignment, Transformer layers are integrated to jointly optimize modality alignment loss and disentanglement loss, effectively suppressing scale mismatch and redundant interference in clinical-imaging data. Additionally, we design a dynamic prognostic decision module that generates personalized interannual recurrence risk heatmaps through temporal upsampling and a gated classification head, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in temporal dynamic modeling and cross-modal alignment. Experiments on 197 CRLM patients demonstrate that the model achieves 100% temporal adjacency accuracy (TAA), with performance significantly surpassing existing approaches. This study establishes the first spatiotemporal modeling paradigm for postoperative dynamic monitoring of CRLM. The proposed framework can be extended to prognostic analysis of multi-cancer metastases, advancing precision surgery from "spatial resection" to "spatiotemporal cure."</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Learned Facial Animation Codec for Low Bitrate Talking Head Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing deep facial animation coding techniques efficiently compress talking head videos by applying deep generative models. Instead of compressing the entire video sequence, these methods focus on compressing only the keyframe and the keypoints of non-keyframes (target frames). The target frames are then reconstructed by utilizing a single keyframe, and the keypoints of the target frame. Although these unidirectional methods can reduce the bitrate, they rely on a single keyframe and often struggle to capture large head movements accurately, resulting in distortions in the facial region. In this paper, we propose a novel bidirectional learned animation codec that generates natural facial videos using past and future keyframes. First, in the Bidirectional Reference-Guided Auxiliary Stream Enhancement (BRG-ASE) process, we introduce a compact auxiliary stream for non-keyframes, which is enhanced by adaptively selecting one of two keyframes (past and future). This stream improves video quality with a slight increase in bitrate. Then, in the Bidirectional Reference-Guided Video Reconstruction (BRG-VRec) process, we animate the adaptively selected keyframe and reconstruct the target frame using both the animated keyframe and the auxiliary frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 55% bitrate reduction compared to the latest animation based video codec, and a 35% bitrate reduction compared to the latest video coding standard, Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on a talking head video dataset. It showcases the efficiency of our approach in improving video quality while simultaneously decreasing bitrate.</description>

      <title>QuickDraw: Fast Visualization, Analysis and Active Learning for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing CT scans, MRIs and X-rays is pivotal in diagnosing and treating diseases. However, detecting and identifying abnormalities from such medical images is a time-intensive process that requires expert analysis and is prone to interobserver variability. To mitigate such issues, machine learning-based models have been introduced to automate and significantly reduce the cost of image segmentation. Despite significant advances in medical image analysis in recent years, many of the latest models are never applied in clinical settings because state-of-the-art models do not easily interface with existing medical image viewers. To address these limitations, we propose QuickDraw, an open-source framework for medical image visualization and analysis that allows users to upload DICOM images and run off-the-shelf models to generate 3D segmentation masks. In addition, our tool allows users to edit, export, and evaluate segmentation masks to iteratively improve state-of-the-art models through active learning. In this paper, we detail the design of our tool and present survey results that highlight the usability of our software. Notably, we find that QuickDraw reduces the time to manually segment a CT scan from four hours to six minutes and reduces machine learning-assisted segmentation time by 10\% compared to prior work. Our code and documentation are available at https://github.com/qd-seg/quickdraw</description>

      <title>Reference-Free 3D Reconstruction of Brain Dissection Photographs with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation of neuropathology with MRI has the potential to transfer microscopic signatures of pathology to invivo scans. Recently, a classical registration method has been proposed, to build these correlations from 3D reconstructed stacks of dissection photographs, which are routinely taken at brain banks. These photographs bypass the need for exvivo MRI, which is not widely accessible. However, this method requires a full stack of brain slabs and a reference mask (e.g., acquired with a surface scanner), which severely limits the applicability of the technique. Here we propose RefFree, a dissection photograph reconstruction method without external reference. RefFree is a learning approach that estimates the 3D coordinates in the atlas space for every pixel in every photograph; simple least-squares fitting can then be used to compute the 3D reconstruction. As a by-product, RefFree also produces an atlas-based segmentation of the reconstructed stack. RefFree is trained on synthetic photographs generated from digitally sliced 3D MRI data, with randomized appearance for enhanced generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real data show that RefFree achieves performance comparable to the baseline method without an explicit reference while also enabling reconstruction of partial stacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/lintian-a/reffree.</description>

      <title>RSR-NF: Neural Field Regularization by Static Restoration Priors for Dynamic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic imaging involves the reconstruction of a spatio-temporal object at all times using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in dynamic computed tomography (dCT), only a single projection at one view angle is available at a time, making the inverse problem very challenging. Moreover, ground-truth dynamic data is usually either unavailable or too scarce to be used for supervised learning techniques. To tackle this problem, we propose RSR-NF, which uses a neural field (NF) to represent the dynamic object and, using the Regularization-by-Denoising (RED) framework, incorporates an additional static deep spatial prior into a variational formulation via a learned restoration operator. We use an ADMM-based algorithm with variable splitting to efficiently optimize the variational objective. We compare RSR-NF to three alternatives: NF with only temporal regularization; a recent method combining a partially-separable low-rank representation with RED using a denoiser pretrained on static data; and a deep-image prior-based model. The first comparison demonstrates the reconstruction improvements achieved by combining the NF representation with static restoration priors, whereas the other two demonstrate the improvement over state-of-the art techniques for dCT.</description>

      <title>CPLOYO: A Pulmonary Nodule Detection Model with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion and Nonlinear Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in pulmonary nodule detection significantly enhances the intelligence and real-time capabilities of the detection system. Currently, lung nodule detection primarily focuses on the identification of solid nodules, but different types of lung nodules correspond to various forms of lung cancer. Multi-type detection contributes to improving the overall lung cancer detection rate and enhancing the cure rate. To achieve high sensitivity in nodule detection, targeted improvements were made to the YOLOv8 model. Firstly, the C2f\_RepViTCAMF module was introduced to augment the C2f module in the backbone, thereby enhancing detection accuracy for small lung nodules and achieving a lightweight model design. Secondly, the MSCAF module was incorporated to reconstruct the feature fusion section of the model, improving detection accuracy for lung nodules of varying scales. Furthermore, the KAN network was integrated into the model. By leveraging the KAN network's powerful nonlinear feature learning capability, detection accuracy for small lung nodules was further improved, and the model's generalization ability was enhanced. Tests conducted on the LUNA16 dataset demonstrate that the improved model outperforms the original model as well as other mainstream models such as YOLOv9 and RT-DETR across various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Dual-domain Modulation Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution images with limited computational costs. We find existing frequency-based SR methods cannot balance the reconstruction of overall structures and high-frequency parts. Meanwhile, these methods are inefficient for handling frequency features and unsuitable for lightweight SR. In this paper, we show introducing both wavelet and Fourier information allows our model to consider both high-frequency features and overall SR structure reconstruction while reducing costs. Specifically, we propose a dual-domain modulation network that utilize wavelet-domain modulation self-Transformer (WMT) plus Fourier supervision to modulate frequency features in addition to spatial domain modulation. Compared to existing frequency-based SR modules, our WMT is more suitable for frequency learning in lightweight SR. Experimental results show that our method achieves a comparable PSNR of SRFormer and MambaIR while with less than 50% and 60% of their FLOPs and achieving inference speeds 15.4x and 5.4x faster, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on SR quality and lightweight. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>G$^{2}$SF-MIAD: Geometry-Guided Score Fusion for Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial quality inspection plays a critical role in modern manufacturing by identifying defective products during production. While single-modality approaches using either 3D point clouds or 2D RGB images suffer from information incompleteness, multimodal anomaly detection offers promise through the complementary fusion of crossmodal data. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively integrating unimodal results and improving discriminative power. To address these limitations, we first reinterpret memory bank-based anomaly scores in single modalities as isotropic Euclidean distances in local feature spaces. Dynamically evolving from Eulidean metrics, we propose a novel \underline{G}eometry-\underline{G}uided \underline{S}core \underline{F}usion (G$^{2}$SF) framework that progressively learns an anisotropic local distance metric as a unified score for the fusion task. Through a geometric encoding operator, a novel Local Scale Prediction Network (LSPN) is proposed to predict direction-aware scaling factors that characterize first-order local feature distributions, thereby enhancing discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Additionally, we develop specialized loss functions and score aggregation strategy from geometric priors to ensure both metric generalization and efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MVTec-3D AD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of our method with low positive rate and better recall, which is essential in industrial application, and detailed ablation analysis validates each component's contribution.</description>

      <title>Automatic quality control in multi-centric fetal brain MRI super-resolution reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where acquisitions and image processing techniques are less standardized than in adult imaging. In this work, we focus on automated quality control of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) volumes of fetal brain MRI, an important processing step where multiple stacks of thick 2D slices are registered together and combined to build a single, isotropic and artifact-free T2 weighted volume. We propose FetMRQC$_{SR}$, a machine-learning method that extracts more than 100 image quality metrics to predict image quality scores using a random forest model. This approach is well suited to a problem that is high dimensional, with highly heterogeneous data and small datasets. We validate FetMRQC$_{SR}$ in an out-of-domain (OOD) setting and report high performance (ROC AUC = 0.89), even when faced with data from an unknown site or SRR method. We also investigate failure cases and show that they occur in $45\%$ of the images due to ambiguous configurations for which the rating from the expert is arguable. These results are encouraging and illustrate how a non deep learning-based method like FetMRQC$_{SR}$ is well suited to this multifaceted problem. Our tool, along with all the code used to generate, train and evaluate the model will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Markerless Tracking-Based Registration for Medical Image Motion Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study focuses on isolating swallowing dynamics from interfering patient motion in videofluoroscopy, an X-ray technique that records patients swallowing a radiopaque bolus. These recordings capture multiple motion sources, including head movement, anatomical displacements, and bolus transit. To enable precise analysis of swallowing physiology, we aim to eliminate distracting motion, particularly head movement, while preserving essential swallowing-related dynamics. Optical flow methods fail due to artifacts like flickering and instability, making them unreliable for distinguishing different motion groups. We evaluated markerless tracking approaches (CoTracker, PIPs++, TAP-Net) and quantified tracking accuracy in key medical regions of interest. Our findings show that even sparse tracking points generate morphing displacement fields that outperform leading registration methods such as ANTs, LDDMM, and VoxelMorph. To compare all approaches, we assessed performance using MSE and SSIM metrics post-registration. We introduce a novel motion correction pipeline that effectively removes disruptive motion while preserving swallowing dynamics and surpassing competitive registration techniques. Code will be available after review.</description>

      <title>PS3C: An Ensemble-Based Two-Step Framework for Classification of Pep Smear Cell Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pep Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pep smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Point Tracking of the Myocardium in 2D Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for point tracking are applicable in 2D echocardiography, but do not yet take advantage of domain specifics that enable extremely fast and efficient configurations. We developed MyoTracker, a low-complexity architecture (0.3M parameters) for point tracking in echocardiography. It builds on the CoTracker2 architecture by simplifying its components and extending the temporal context to provide point predictions for the entire sequence in a single step. We applied MyoTracker to the right ventricular (RV) myocardium in RV-focused recordings and compared the results with those of CoTracker2 and EchoTracker, another specialized point tracking architecture for echocardiography. MyoTracker achieved the lowest average point trajectory error at 2.00 $\pm$ 0.53 mm. Calculating RV Free Wall Strain (RV FWS) using MyoTracker's point predictions resulted in a -0.3$\%$ bias with 95$\%$ limits of agreement from -6.1$\%$ to 5.4$\%$ compared to reference values from commercial software. This range falls within the interobserver variability reported in previous studies. The limits of agreement were wider for both CoTracker2 and EchoTracker, worse than the interobserver variability. At inference, MyoTracker used 67$\%$ less GPU memory than CoTracker2 and 84$\%$ less than EchoTracker on large sequences (100 frames). MyoTracker was 74 times faster during inference than CoTracker2 and 11 times faster than EchoTracker with our setup. Maintaining the entire sequence in the temporal context was the greatest contributor to MyoTracker's accuracy. Slight additional gains can be made by re-enabling iterative refinement, at the cost of longer processing time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing accelerated MRI is an ill-posed problem. Machine learning has recently shown great promise at this task, but current approaches to quantifying uncertainty focus on measuring the variability in pixelwise intensity variation. Although these provide interpretable maps, they lack structural understanding and they do not have a clear relationship to how the data will be analysed subsequently. In this paper, we propose a new approach to evaluating reconstruction variability based on apparent anatomical changes in the reconstruction, which is more tightly related to common downstream tasks. We use image registration and segmentation to evaluate several common MRI reconstruction approaches, where uncertainty is measured via ensembling, for accelerated imaging. We demonstrate the intrinsic variability in reconstructed images and show that models with high scores on often used quality metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, can nonetheless display high levels of variance and bias in anatomical measures.</description>

      <title>V2M4: 4D Mesh Animation Reconstruction from a Single Monocular Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Resolution Invariant Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical imaging analysis, yet variations in image resolution remain an overlooked challenge. Most methods address this by resampling images, leading to either information loss or computational inefficiencies. While solutions exist for specific tasks, no unified approach has been proposed. We introduce a resolution-invariant autoencoder that adapts spatial resizing at each layer in the network via a learned variable resizing process, replacing fixed spatial down/upsampling at the traditional factor of 2. This ensures a consistent latent space resolution, regardless of input or output resolution. Our model enables various downstream tasks to be performed on an image latent whilst maintaining performance across different resolutions, overcoming the shortfalls of traditional methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness in uncertainty-aware super-resolution, classification, and generative modelling tasks and show how our method outperforms conventional baselines with minimal performance loss across resolutions.</description>

      <title>MetricGrids: Arbitrary Nonlinear Approximation with Elementary Metric Grids based Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents MetricGrids, a novel grid-based neural representation that combines elementary metric grids in various metric spaces to approximate complex nonlinear signals. While grid-based representations are widely adopted for their efficiency and scalability, the existing feature grids with linear indexing for continuous-space points can only provide degenerate linear latent space representations, and such representations cannot be adequately compensated to represent complex nonlinear signals by the following compact decoder. To address this problem while keeping the simplicity of a regular grid structure, our approach builds upon the standard grid-based paradigm by constructing multiple elementary metric grids as high-order terms to approximate complex nonlinearities, following the Taylor expansion principle. Furthermore, we enhance model compactness with hash encoding based on different sparsities of the grids to prevent detrimental hash collisions, and a high-order extrapolation decoder to reduce explicit grid storage requirements. experimental results on both 2D and 3D reconstructions demonstrate the superior fitting and rendering accuracy of the proposed method across diverse signal types, validating its robustness and generalizability.

      <title>Fourier Decomposition for Explicit Representation of 3D Point Cloud Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While 3D point clouds are widely utilized across various vision applications, their irregular and sparse nature make them challenging to handle. In response, numerous encoding approaches have been proposed to capture the rich semantic information of point clouds. Yet, a critical limitation persists: a lack of consideration for colored point clouds which are more capable 3D representations as they contain diverse attributes: color and geometry. While existing methods handle these attributes separately on a per-point basis, this leads to a limited receptive field and restricted ability to capture relationships across multiple points. To address this, we pioneer a point cloud encoding methodology that leverages 3D Fourier decomposition to disentangle color and geometric features while extending the receptive field through spectral-domain operations. Our analysis confirms that this encoding approach effectively separates feature components, where the amplitude uniquely captures color attributes and the phase encodes geometric structure, thereby enabling independent learning and utilization of both attributes. Furthermore, the spectral-domain properties of these components naturally aggregate local features while considering multiple points' information. We validate our point cloud encoding approach on point cloud classification and style transfer tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the DensePoint dataset with improvements via a proposed amplitude-based data augmentation strategy.</description>

      <title>Image Quality Assessment: From Human to Machine Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) based on human subjective preferences has undergone extensive research in the past decades. However, with the development of communication protocols, the visual data consumption volume of machines has gradually surpassed that of humans. For machines, the preference depends on downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection, rather than visual appeal. Considering the huge gap between human and machine visual systems, this paper proposes the topic: Image Quality Assessment for Machine Vision for the first time. Specifically, we (1) defined the subjective preferences of machines, including downstream tasks, test models, and evaluation metrics; (2) established the Machine Preference Database (MPD), which contains 2.25M fine-grained annotations and 30k reference/distorted image pair instances; (3) verified the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on MPD. Experiments show that current IQA metrics are human-centric and cannot accurately characterize machine preferences. We sincerely hope that MPD can promote the evolution of IQA from human to machine preferences. Project page is on: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/MPD.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Agents for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Image Restoration (IR) studies typically focus on task-specific or universal modes individually, relying on the mode selection of users and lacking the cooperation between multiple task-specific/universal restoration modes. This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.</description>

Abstract: The implication of the thalamus in multiple neurological pathologies makes it a structure of interest for volumetric analysis. In the present work, we have designed and implemented a multimodal volumetric deep neural network for the segmentation of thalamic nuclei at ultra-high resolution (0.125 mm3). Current tools either operate at standard resolution (1 mm3) or use monomodal data. To achieve the proposed objective, first, a database of semiautomatically segmented thalamic nuclei was created using ultra-high resolution T1, T2 and White Matter nulled (WMn) images. Then, a novel Deep learning based strategy was designed to obtain the automatic segmentations and trained to improve its robustness and accuaracy using a semisupervised approach. The proposed method was compared with a related state-of-the-art method showing competitive results both in terms of segmentation quality and efficiency. To make the proposed method fully available to the scientific community, a full pipeline able to work with monomodal standard resolution T1 images is also proposed.</description>

      <title>ReLaX-VQA: Residual Fragment and Layer Stack Extraction for Enhancing Video Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild is increasingly evident. UGC is typically acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression (transcoding) before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that employ the original content as a reference are not suitable. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the quality of diverse video content without reference to the original uncompressed videos. ReLaX-VQA uses frame differences to select spatio-temporal fragments intelligently together with different expressions of spatial features associated with the sampled frames. These are then used to better capture spatial and temporal variabilities in the quality of neighbouring frames. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers. Extensive testing across four UGC datasets demonstrates that ReLaX-VQA consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving an average SRCC of 0.8658 and PLCC of 0.8873. Open-source code and trained models that will facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA can be found at https://github.com/xinyiW915/ReLaX-VQA.</description>

      <title>When Mamba Meets xLSTM: An Efficient and Precise Method with the xLSTM-VMUNet Model for Skin lesion Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Automatic melanoma segmentation is essential for early skin cancer detection, yet challenges arise from the heterogeneity of melanoma, as well as interfering factors like blurred boundaries, low contrast, and imaging artifacts. While numerous algorithms have been developed to address these issues, previous approaches have often overlooked the need to jointly capture spatial and sequential features within dermatological images. This limitation hampers segmentation accuracy, especially in cases with indistinct borders or structurally similar lesions. Additionally, previous models lacked both a global receptive field and high computational efficiency. In this work, we present the xLSTM-VMUNet Model, which jointly capture spatial and sequential features within dermatological images successfully. xLSTM-VMUNet can not only specialize in extracting spatial features from images, focusing on the structural characteristics of skin lesions, but also enhance contextual understanding, allowing more effective handling of complex medical image structures. Experiment results on the ISIC2018 dataset demonstrate that xLSTM-VMUNet outperforms VMUNet by 4.85% on DSC and 6.41% on IoU on the ISIC2017 dataset, by 1.25% on DSC and 2.07% on IoU on the ISIC2018 dataset, with faster convergence and consistently high segmentation performance.

      <title>Continuous K-space Recovery Network with Image Guidance for Fast MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool for clinical diagnosis while facing the challenge of long scanning time. To reduce the acquisition time, fast MRI reconstruction aims to restore high-quality images from the undersampled k-space. Existing methods typically train deep learning models to map the undersampled data to artifact-free MRI images. However, these studies often overlook the unique properties of k-space and directly apply general networks designed for image processing to k-space recovery, leaving the precise learning of k-space largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a continuous k-space recovery network from a new perspective of implicit neural representation with image domain guidance, which boosts the performance of MRI reconstruction. Specifically, (1) an implicit neural representation based encoder-decoder structure is customized to continuously query unsampled k-values. (2) an image guidance module is designed to mine the semantic information from the low-quality MRI images to further guide the k-space recovery. (3) a multi-stage training strategy is proposed to recover dense k-space progressively. Extensive experiments conducted on CC359, fastMRI, and IXI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over other competitors.</description>

      <title>Fast MRI for All: Bridging Equity Gaps via Training without Raw Data Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this expensive imaging modality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce holiAtlas, a holistic, multimodal and high-resolution human brain atlas. This atlas covers different levels of details of the human brain anatomy, from the organ to the substructure level, using a new dense labelled protocol generated from the fusion of multiple local protocols at different scales. This atlas has been constructed averaging images and segmentations of 75 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project database. Specifically, MR images of T1, T2 and WMn (White Matter nulled) contrasts at 0.125 $mm^{3}$ resolution that were nonlinearly registered and averaged using symmetric group-wise normalisation to construct the atlas. At the finest level, the holiAtlas protocol has 350 different labels derived from 10 different delineation protocols. These labels were grouped at different scales to provide a holistic view of the brain at different levels in a coherent and consistent manner. This multiscale and multimodal atlas can be used for the development of new ultra-high resolution segmentation methods that can potentially leverage the early detection of neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Learning-based Model for Cardiac Image Reconstruction: Summary of the CMRxRecon2024 Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers diverse contrasts for non-invasive assessment of cardiac function and myocardial characterization. However, CMR often requires the acquisition of many contrasts, and each contrast takes a considerable amount of time. The extended acquisition time will further increase the susceptibility to motion artifacts. Existing deep learning-based reconstruction methods have been proven to perform well in image reconstruction tasks, but most of them are designed for specific acquisition modality or dedicated imaging parameter, which limits their ability to generalize across a variety of scan scenarios. To address this issue, the CMRxRecon2024 challenge consists of two specific tasks: Task 1 focuses on a modality-universal setting, evaluating the out-of-distribution generalization of existing learning-based models, while Task 2 follows a k-space sampling-universal setting, assessing the all-in-one adaptability of universal models. Main contributions of this challenge include providing the largest publicly available multi-modality, multi-view cardiac k-space dataset; and developing an open benchmarking platform for algorithm evaluation and shared code library for data processing. In addition, through a detailed analysis of the results submitted to the challenge, we have also made several findings, including: 1) adaptive prompt-learning embedding is an effective means for achieving strong generalization in reconstruction models; 2) enhanced data consistency based on physics-informed networks is also an effective pathway toward a universal model; 3) traditional evaluation metrics have limitations when assessing ground-truth references with moderate or lower image quality, highlighting the need for subjective evaluation methods. This challenge attracted 200 participants from 18 countries, aimed at promoting their translation into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>X-GAN: A Generative AI-Powered Unsupervised Model for High-Precision Segmentation of Retinal Main Vessels toward Early Detection of Glaucoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06743</link>

Abstract: Structural changes in main retinal blood vessels serve as critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma. Identifying these vessels is vital for vascular modeling yet highly challenging. This paper proposes X-GAN, a generative AI-powered unsupervised segmentation model designed for extracting main blood vessels from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. The process begins with the Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) to rapidly generate a skeleton of vessels, featuring their radii. By synergistically integrating generative adversarial networks (GANs) with biostatistical modeling of vessel radii, X-GAN enables a fast reconstruction of both 2D and 3D representations of the vessels. Based on this reconstruction, X-GAN achieves nearly 100\% segmentation accuracy without relying on labeled data or high-performance computing resources. Also, to address the Issue, data scarity, we introduce GSS-RetVein, a high-definition mixed 2D and 3D glaucoma retinal dataset. GSS-RetVein provides a rigorous benchmark due to its exceptionally clear capillary structures, introducing controlled noise for testing model robustness. Its 2D images feature sharp capillary boundaries, while its 3D component enhances vascular reconstruction and blood flow prediction, supporting glaucoma progression simulations. Experimental results confirm GSS-RetVein's superiority in evaluating main vessel segmentation compared to existing datasets.

      <title>The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</description>

      <title>U-Motion: Learned Point Cloud Video Compression with U-Structured Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</description>

      <title>Video Super-Resolution: All You Need is a Video Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generic video super-resolution algorithm in this paper, based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework with an unconditional video generation model in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has strong capabilities to address video super-resolution challenges.</description>
