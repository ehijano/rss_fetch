      <title>Practical Modelling with Bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bigraphs are a versatile modelling formalism that allows easy expression of placement and connectivity relations in a graphical format. System evolution is user defined as a set of rewrite rules. This paper presents a practical, yet detailed guide to developing, executing, and reasoning about bigraph models, including recent extensions such as parameterised, instantaneous, prioritised and conditional rules, and probabilistic and stochastic rewriting.</description>

      <title>Shape Constraints in Symbolic Regression using Penalized Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the addition of shape constraints and their consideration during the parameter estimation step of symbolic regression (SR). Shape constraints serve as a means to introduce prior knowledge about the shape of the otherwise unknown model function into SR. Unlike previous works that have explored shape constraints in SR, we propose minimizing shape constraint violations during parameter estimation using gradient-based numerical optimization.
  We test three algorithm variants to evaluate their performance in identifying three symbolic expressions from a synthetically generated data set. This paper examines two benchmark scenarios: one with varying noise levels and another with reduced amounts of training data. The results indicate that incorporating shape constraints into the expression search is particularly beneficial when data is scarce. Compared to using shape constraints only in the selection process, our approach of minimizing violations during parameter estimation shows a statistically significant benefit in some of our test cases, without being significantly worse in any instance.</description>

      <title>ParSEL: Parameterized Shape Editing with Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to edit 3D assets from natural language presents a compelling paradigm to aid in the democratization of 3D content creation. However, while natural language is often effective at communicating general intent, it is poorly suited for specifying precise manipulation. To address this gap, we introduce ParSEL, a system that enables controllable editing of high-quality 3D assets from natural language. Given a segmented 3D mesh and an editing request, ParSEL produces a parameterized editing program. Adjusting the program parameters allows users to explore shape variations with a precise control over the magnitudes of edits. To infer editing programs which align with an input edit request, we leverage the abilities of large-language models (LLMs). However, while we find that LLMs excel at identifying initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, and produce outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed. Unlike prior methods, AEP searches for analytical editing operations compatible with a range of possible user edits through the integration of computer algebra systems for geometric analysis. Experimentally we demonstrate ParSEL's effectiveness in enabling controllable editing of 3D objects through natural language requests over alternative system designs.</description>
