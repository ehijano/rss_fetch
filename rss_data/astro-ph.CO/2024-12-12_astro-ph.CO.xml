      <title>Discovery of a Ly{\alpha} blob photo-ionised by a super-cluster of massive stars associated to a z = 3.49 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterisation of a Lya blob close to a galaxy at redshift z=3.49. We present our analysis to check whether the companion galaxy could be the source of the ionised photons responsible for the Lya emission from the blob. We use images obtained from the 10.4 m GTC telescope that are part of the SHARDS project. The blob is only visible in the F551W17 filter, centred around the Lya line at the redshift of the galaxy. We measure the luminosity of the blob with a two-step procedure. First, we describe the radial surface brightness (SB) profile of the galaxy using a Sersic function. We then remove this model from the SB profile of the blob and measure the luminosity of the blob alone. We also estimate the Lya continuum of the galaxy using an ACS image from the HST in the filter F606W, that is wider than the SHARDS one and centred at about the same wavelength. In this image the galaxy is visible, but the blob is not detected, since its Lya emission is diluted in the larger wavelength range of the F606W filter. We find that the Lya luminosity of the blob is 1.0x1043 erg s-1, in agreement with other Lya blobs reported in the literature. The luminosity of the galaxy in the same filter is 2.9x1042 erg s-1. The luminosity within the HST/ACS image is Lcont=1.1x1043 erg s-1. With these values we are able to estimate the Lya equivalent width (EW), that is found to be 111 {\AA} (rest-frame). This value suggests that a super-cluster of massive (1-2x107 Msun) and young (2-4 Myr) stars could be responsible for the ionisation of the blob. We also use two other methods to estimate the luminosity of the galaxy and the blob, both supporting our conclusions. It is worth noting that the Lya blob is spatially decoupled from the galaxy by 5.7 kpc. This misalignment could suggest the presence of an ionised cone of escaping material, as found in nearby galaxies such as M82.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Cepheid-based distance ladder: implications for the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise value remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe measurement methods, a problem known as the "Hubble tension." In this study, we revisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two potential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) how Milky Way (MW) Cepheids are treated and (2) systematic differences in the periodicities of Cepheids in anchor galaxies versus supernova host galaxies. To address these issues, we adopt two strategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy involves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common periodicity distribution. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \pm 1.76) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. The increased uncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per resampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the Hubble tension from $5.4 \, \sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration with $H_0 = (73.17 \pm 0.86) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \, \sigma$. The second strategy allows the PLR slope to vary across different periodicity ranges, yielding $H_0 = (72.35 \pm 0.91) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ and the tension reduced to $4.4 \, \sigma$. Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of approximately $-1 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for precise $H_0$ calibrations.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological parameters using density split lensing and the conditional stellar mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a simulation-based model to predict the excess surface mass density (ESD) depending on the local density environment. Using a conditional stellar mass function, our foreground galaxies are tailored toward the bright galaxy sample of the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Due to the nature of the ESD measurement, our derived model is directly applicable to all DESI data. To build this model, we use the $\texttt{AbacusSummit}$ N-body simulation suite from which we measure all necessary statistics and train an emulator based on $\texttt{CosmoPower}$. Finally, we present a cosmological parameter forecast for a possible combined analysis of DESI and the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey.</description>

      <title>BBN-simple: How to Bake a Universe-Sized Cake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the process of creation of lightest elements in the early universe, is a highly robust, precise, and ultimately successful theory that forms one of the three pillars of the standard hot-Big-Bang cosmological model. Existing theoretical treatments of BBN and the associated computer codes are accurate and flexible, but are typically highly technical and opaque, and not suitable for pedagogical understanding of the BBN. Here we present BBN-simple -- a from-scratch numerical calculation of the lightest element abundances pitched at an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level. We review the physics of the early universe relevant for BBN, provide information about the reaction rates, and discuss computational-mathematics background that is essential in setting up a BBN calculation. We calculate the abundances of the principal nuclear species in a standard cosmological model, and find a reasonably good agreement with public precision-level BBN codes.</description>

      <title>Constraining Asymmetric DM Properties by Black Hole Formation in Neutron Stars and Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the potential for Neutron Stars (NSs) at the Galactic center and Population~III stars to constrain Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM). We demonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density ($\rhox\gtrsim10^{9}\unit{GeV/cm^3}$), the effects of both multiscatter capture and DM evaporation cannot be neglected. If a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) forms from ADM, then its low temperature and densely cored profile render evaporation from the BEC negligible, strengthening detectability of low-mass DM. Because of this, we find that the most easily observable Population III stars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\sigma$ low-$\mx$ DM, maintaining efficacy below $\mx=10^{-15}\unit{GeV}$ thanks to their far lower value of $\mx$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we derive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary polytropic objects.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of small-scale induced gravitational waves from the soliton/oscillon domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations and scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the production of long-lived solitons and oscillons, which can dominate the early Universe and drive reheating prior to the standard radiation-dominated era. Curvature perturbations are generated not only by the Poisson distribution of these solitons/oscillons but are also amplified during the early matter-dominated phase when the solitons/oscillons dominate. Scalar-induced GWs with characteristic energy spectra emerge from these amplified curvature perturbations, particularly at the sudden transition from matter domination to radiation domination. We analyze this scenario and its GW predictions in detail, focusing on the impact of the initial energy fraction, the lifetime, and the average separation of these solitons/oscillons. This provides a wealth of potential observational targets for various GW detectors. Furthermore, for inflation and preheating models that produce oscillons with large separations, we derive new constraints on these models based on the upper bounds on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, as anticipated from future cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Full-Shape Dynamical Dark Energy Constraints with Galaxy Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent $2-4\sigma$ deviations from the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ suggest that dark energy (DE) may be dynamical, based on baryon acoustic oscillations and full-shape galaxy clustering (FS GC) analyses. This calls for even tighter DE constraints to narrow down its true nature. In this Letter, we explore how galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) can enhance the FS GC-based DE constraints, using Fisher forecasts on various extensions of dynamical DE models, including scenarios with curvature, massive neutrinos, and modified gravity. Incorporating IA improves the DE Figure-of-Merit by $42-57\%$ and tightens the primordial power spectrum amplitude constraints by $17-19\%$. Our findings highlight IA's potential as a valuable cosmological probe complementary to GC.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological constraints via galaxy intrinsic alignment in full-shape analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxy shapes probes the underlying gravitational tidal field, thus offering cosmological information complementary to galaxy clustering. In this paper, we perform a Fisher forecast to assess the benefit of IA in improving cosmological parameter constraints, for the first time, leveraging the full-shape (FS) information of IA statistics. Our forecast is based on PFS-like and Euclid-like surveys as examples of deep and wide galaxy surveys, respectively. We explore various cosmological models, with the most comprehensive one simultaneously including dynamical dark energy, curvature, massive neutrinos, and modified gravity (MG). We find that adding FS IA information significantly tightens cosmological constraints relative to the FS clustering-only cases, particularly for dynamical dark energy and nonflat-MG models. For a deep galaxy survey, the Figure-of-Merit for the dark energy equation of state parameters is improved by at least more than $40\%$ in all dynamical dark energy models investigated. For nonflat-MG models, parameter constraints are tightened by $6-28\%$, except for the dark matter density and spectral index parameters. For a wide galaxy survey, improvements with IA become milder, although its joint constraints are tighter than those from the deep survey. Our findings highlight the efficacy of the galaxy IA as a complementary cosmological probe to galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>CRAFTS for HI cosmology: I. data analysis and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from calibrating the data of the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS) for \HI intensity mapping by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). Using 70 hours of drift-scan observation with the L-band (1.05-1.45GHz) 19-beam receiver, we obtain the data covering $270\,\rm deg^2$ sky area. We employ both the pulsar backend and the spectrum backend to calibrate the spectral time-ordered-data (TOD) before projecting them onto HEALPix maps. We produce calibrated TOD with frequency resolution of 30 kHz and time resolution of 1 s and the map data-cube with frequency resolution of 30kHz and spatial resolution of $2.95\,\rm arcmin^2$. We carefully examine the pointing errors, noise overflow, RFI contamination and their effect on the data quality. The resulting noise level is $\sim$ 5.7 mJy for the calibrated TOD and 1.6 mJy for the map, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions within 5\% at RFI-free channels. We also validate the data by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and find most foreground components are concentrated in the first 30 modes. We identify 447 isolated bright continuum sources in our data matching the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog, with relative flux error of 8.3\% for TOD and 11.9\% for the map-level. We also measure the \HI emission of 90 galaxies with redshift $z&lt;0.07$ and compare with \HI-MaNGA spectra from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), yielding an overall relative error of the \HI integral flux of 16.7\%. Our results confirm the feasibility of conducting cosmological \HI signal detection with CRAFTS.</description>

      <title>On the construction of fuzzy dark matter halos with arbitrary initial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is non-zero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Tully-Fisher Relation to Measure the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boubel et al. 2024 (B24) recently used the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation to measure calibrated distances in the Hubble flow and found $H_0= 73.3 \pm 2.1 (stat) \pm 3.5 (sys)$ km/s/Mpc. The large systematic uncertainty was the result of propagating the conflict between two sources of empirical distance calibration: a difference in zeropoint when calibrating the TF relation with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) versus Cepheids and Tip-of-the-Red-Giant-Branch (TRGB) and an apparent difference in zeropoint between two distinct TRGB datasets. We trace the SN Ia-based calibration used in the TF analysis to a study where $H_0$ was fixed to 70 km/s/Mpc rather than measured, (with host distances derived from redshifts and the Hubble law), thus introducing a discrepancy with the other empirically calibrated indicators. In addition, we trace the difference in TRGB zeropoints to a miscalibration of $0.14$ mag that should be $\sim0.01-0.04$ mag. Using the consistent Cepheid and TRGB calibration from B24 while removing the problematic data reduces the systematic error by a factor of two and results in $H_0 = 76.3 \pm 2.1 \textrm{(stat)} \pm 1.5 \textrm{(sys)}$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement is consistent with previous determinations of $H_0$ using the TF relation. We also show that most determinations of $H_0$ measurements that replace Type Ia supernovae measurements with another far-field distance indicator yield $H_0&gt;73$ km/s/Mpc, reinforcing previous findings that the Hubble tension is not tied to any one distance indicator.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Low Frequency Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background: Constraints from Quasars and the Astrometric Hellings-Downs Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new astrometric constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background and construct the first astrometric Hellings-Downs curve using quasar proper motions. From quadrupolar vector spherical harmonic fits to the Gaia proper motions of 1,108,858 quasars, we obtain a frequency-integrated upper limit on the gravitational wave energy density, $h_{70}^2\Omega_{GW} \leq 0.023$ (95% confidence limit), for frequencies between 11.2 nHz and $3.1\times10^{-9}$ nHz ($1.33/t_0$). However, from the astrometric Hellings-Downs curve that describes the correlated proper motions between 2,104,609,881 quasar pairs as a function of their angular separation, we find a much stronger constraint: a characteristic strain of $h_{c} \leq 2.9 \times 10^{-12}$ for $f_{\rm ref} = 1$ yr$^{-1}$ and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{\rm GW} \leq 0.010$ at 95% confidence. We probe down to $\pm$0.005 $\mu$as$^2$ yr$^{-2}$ in correlated power and obtain the lowest astrometric limit to date. This is also the first time that optical wavelength astrometry surpasses limits from radio-frequency interferometry. This astrometric analysis does not yet reach the sensitivity needed to detect the pulsar timing-based red gravitational wave spectrum extrapolated to the quasar gravitational wave sensitivity window, assuming that the turnover in the spectrum occurs at $\sim$1 nHz for massive black hole binaries. The limits presented here may exclude some exotic interpretations of the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>A 1% accurate method to include baryonic effects in galaxy-galaxy lensing models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing are two of the main observational probes in Stage-IV large-scale structure surveys. Unfortunately, the complicated relationship between galaxies and matter limits the exploitation of this data. Galaxy bias models -- such as the hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion -- allow describing galaxy clustering down to scales as small as $k = 0.7h$/Mpc. However, the galaxy-matter cross-power spectra are already affected by baryons on these scales, directly impacting the modelling of galaxy-galaxy lensing. We propose to extend models of the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum $P_{\rm gm}(k)$ (currently only accounting for dark matter) by including a baryonic correction inferred from the matter component ($S_{\rm mm}(k)$), so that $P_{\rm gm, full \, physics} (k) = \sqrt{S_{\rm mm}} P_{\rm gm, gravity \, only}$. We use the FLAMINGO simulations to measure the effect of baryons on the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum and to assess the performance of our model. We perform a Bayesian analysis of synthetic data, implementing a model based on BACCO's hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion (for the nonlinear galaxy bias) and Baryon Correction Model. Ignoring baryons in the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum leads to a biased inference of the galaxy bias, while ignoring baryons in both the galaxy-matter and matter-matter power spectra leads to a biased inference of both the galaxy bias and cosmological parameters. In contrast, our method is 1% accurate compared to all physics variations in FLAMINGO and on all scales described by hybrid perturbative models ($k &lt; 0.7h$/Mpc). Moreover, our model leads to inferred bias and cosmological parameters compatible within 1$\sigma$ with their reference values. We anticipate that our method will be a promising candidate for analysing forthcoming Stage-IV survey data.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence principle across the Universe: a model-independent approach with galaxy multi-tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a test of the equivalence principle on cosmological scales involving minimal assumptions. Our approach relies on the cross-correlation of two different galaxy populations with large-scale relativistic corrections. We construct a measurable quantity $E_P$ acting as a null test, i.e. deviating from unity whenever the weak equivalence principle is violated. We provide forecasts with the DESI Bright Galaxy Sample and with the Square Kilometre Array Phase 2 (SKA2). The relativistic corrections can be detected with high significance by both surveys, while $E_P$ can only be measured by SKA2. We forecast a precision around 10-15$\%$ across the redshift range between 0.25 and 0.75.</description>

      <title>The UV Sensitivity of Axion Monodromy Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and uncover a novel sensitivity of cosmological observables to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Massive Inflationary Amplitudes: Differential Equations and Complete Solutions for General Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and solve a complete system of differential equations for general tree-level inflation correlators with an arbitrary number of massive scalar exchanges and time-dependent couplings. Any massive tree correlators can be uniquely fixed by solving this system of equations with appropriate boundary conditions. We take a hybrid approach to solve this system, using the differential equation to get the inhomogeneous solution and the bulk time integrals to determine the homogeneous solution. Altogether, we obtain analytical results for all tree-level massive inflation correlators with generic kinematics, expressed as multivariate hypergeometric series of energy ratios. The result can be neatly organized as a sum of the completely inhomogeneous solution, which we call the massive family tree, and all of its cuts. As simple applications, we provide full analytical expressions for tree correlators with one, two, and three massive exchanges.</description>

      <title>A first measurement of galaxy merger rate increasing in dynamically colder protoclusters at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of galaxy cluster formation likely leaves an imprint on the properties of its individual member galaxies. Understanding this process is essential for uncovering the evolutionary connections between galaxies and cosmic structures. Here we study a sample of ten protoclusters at z~2-3 in different dynamical states that we estimate based on spectroscopic data of their members. We combine the dynamical information with HST imaging to measure galaxy sizes and pair fractions. Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between the velocity dispersion of the protocluster and its galaxy pair fractions (indicative of merger rates). The velocity dispersion also anti-correlates with the dispersion in size among of the member galaxies. These correlations may be explained by protoclusters in colder dynamical states maintaining a velocity dispersion and galaxy number density that boosts galaxy mergers, which in turn contributes to the structural expansion and compaction of galaxies. Our findings offer constraints for cosmological models regarding the evolution of galaxy morphology across different stages in the assembly of protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Initial Conditions from Non-Linear Cosmic Structures using Field-Level Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysing next-generation cosmological data requires balancing accurate modeling of non-linear gravitational structure formation and computational demands. We propose a solution by introducing a machine learning-based field-level emulator, within the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-based Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) inference algorithm. Built on a V-net neural network architecture, the emulator enhances the predictions by first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory to be accurately aligned with full $N$-body simulations while significantly reducing evaluation time. We test its incorporation in BORG for sampling cosmic initial conditions using mock data based on non-linear large-scale structures from $N$-body simulations and Gaussian noise. The method efficiently and accurately explores the high-dimensional parameter space of initial conditions, fully extracting the cross-correlation information of the data field binned at a resolution of $1.95h^{-1}$ Mpc. Percent-level agreement with the ground truth in the power spectrum and bispectrum is achieved up to the Nyquist frequency $k_\mathrm{N} \approx 2.79h \; \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Posterior resimulations - using the inferred initial conditions for $N$-body simulations - show that the recovery of information in the initial conditions is sufficient to accurately reproduce halo properties. In particular, we show highly accurate $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halo mass function and stacked density profiles of haloes in different mass bins $[0.853,16]\times 10^{14}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$. As all available cross-correlation information is extracted, we acknowledge that limitations in recovering the initial conditions stem from the noise level and data grid resolution. This is promising as it underscores the significance of accurate non-linear modeling, indicating the potential for extracting additional information at smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Lagrangian Galaxy Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding $\textit{galaxy bias}$ -- that is the statistical relation between matter and galaxies -- is of key importance for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys. While the bias function $f$ -- that is the probability of forming galaxy in a region with a given density field -- is usually approximated through a parametric expansion, we show here, that it can also be measured directly from simulations in a non-parameteric way. Our measurements show that the Lagrangian bias function is very close to a Gaussian for halo selections of any mass. Therefore, we newly introduce a Gaussian bias model with several intriguing properties: (1) It predicts only strictly positive probabilities $f &gt; 0$ (unlike expansion models), (2) It has a simple analytic renormalized form and (3) It behaves gracefully in many scenarios where the classical expansion converges poorly. We show that the Gaussian bias model describes the galaxy environment distribution $p(\delta | \mathrm{g})$, the scale dependent bias function $f$ and the renormalized bias function $F$ of haloes and galaxies generally equally well or significantly better than a second order expansion with the same number of parameters. We suggest that a Gaussian bias approach may enhance the range of validity of bias schemes where the canonical expansion converges poorly and further, that it may make new applications possible, since it guarantees the positivity of predicted galaxy densities.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter, Core Collapse and the Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Despite the remarkable explanatory power of CDM on large scales, tensions with observations on small scales have been reported. Recent studies find that the observational cross-section for Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing (GGSL) in clusters exceeds the CDM prediction by more than an order of magnitude, and persists even after rigorous examination of various possible systematics. We investigate the impact of modifying the internal structure of cluster dark matter sub-halos on GGSL and report that altering the inner density profile, given by $r^{\gamma}$, to steeper slopes with $\gamma &gt; 2.5$ can alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. Deviating from the $\gamma \sim 1.0$ cusps that CDM predicts, these steeper slopes could arise in models of self-interacting dark matter undergoing core collapse. Our results motivate additional study of sub-halo core collapse in dense cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Information content in anisotropic cosmological fields: Impact of different multipole expansion scheme for galaxy density and ellipticity correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipole expansions have been often used for extracting cosmological information from anisotropic quantities in observation. However, which basis of the expansion is best suited to quantify the anisotropies is not a trivial question in any summary statistics. In this paper, using the Fisher matrix formalism, we investigate the information content in multipole moments of the power spectra of galaxy density and intrinsic ellipticity fields in linear theory from the Alcock-Paczynski effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). We consider two expansion schemes, the associated Legendre basis as well as the standard Legendre basis conventionally used in literature. We find that the information in the multipoles of the intrinsic alignment (IA) power spectra in the associated Legendre basis converges more slowly to that in the full 2D power spectra than in the Legendre basis. This trend is particularly significant when we consider a high number density sample. In this high number density case, we show that the errors on the Hubble parameter obtained from the multipoles of the IA cross- and auto-power spectra in the associated Legendre basis are respectively about $6 \%$ and $10 \%$ larger than the full 2D case even when we use multipoles up to $\ell = 6$. Our results demonstrate that the choice of basis is arbitrary but changes the information content encoded in multipoles depending on the sample and statistics under consideration.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We nonparametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our nonparametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/nonmonotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a framework for numerically computing the effects of free-streaming in scalar fields produced after inflation. First, we provide a detailed prescription for setting up initial conditions in the field. This prescription allows us to specify the power spectra of the fields (peaked on subhorizon length scales and without a homogeneous field mode), and importantly, also correctly reproduces the behaviour of density perturbations on large length scales consistent with superhorizon adiabatic perturbations. We then evolve the fields using a spatially inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation, including the effects of expansion and radiation-sourced metric perturbations. We show how gravity enhances, and how free streaming erases the initially adiabatic density perturbations of the field, revealing more of the underlying, non-evolving, white-noise isocurvature density contrast. Furthermore, we explore the effect of non-gravitational self-interactions of the field, including oscillon formation, on the suppression dynamics. As part of this paper, we make our code, ${\sf{Cosmic-Fields-Lite}}$ (${\sf{CFL}}$), publicly available. For observationally accessible signatures, our work is particularly relevant for structure formation in light/ultralight dark matter fields.</description>

      <title>Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Alimi &amp; Koskas highlighted in $w$CDM models derived from general relativity (GR) (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark-matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the nonlinear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. This paper shows that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different N-body solver, and that it is also robust to adding massive neutrinos to the cold DM component. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in MG models. Thus, we examined whether the invariance observed by Alimi &amp; Koskas remains robust in the case of Hu &amp; Sawicki model using DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder numerical simulations. By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of $w$CDM models of GR. These deviations suggest that the gravitation's nature significantly influences the DM halos' shape. We then interpreted this departure from the GR models' invariance as a manifestation of the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such $f(R)$-type theories. This one modifies the sphericization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the departure from cosmological invariance in DM halos' shape is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.</description>

      <title>High-redshift cosmography with a possible cosmic distance duality relation violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we used geometric distances at high redshifts (both luminosity and angular) to perform a cosmographic analysis with the Pad\'e method, which stabilizes the behaviour of the cosmographic series in this redshift regime. However, in our analyses, we did not assume the validity of the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), but allowed for potential violations, such as $d_L(z) = \eta(z)(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, where three different functional forms of $\eta(z)$ are considered. By incorporating updated data from supernovae (SN), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic chronometers (CC), we obtained observational constraints on cosmographic models alongside possible CDDR violations. Interestingly, we found that potential CDDR violations introduce new statistical correlations among cosmographic parameters such as $H_0$, $q_0$, and $j_0$. Nonetheless, within this framework, we did not observe significant deviations from the CDDR, and our results remain consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In the same time, this work provides a novel and straightforward method for testing the CDDR by fixing the background evolution through cosmographic techniques, paving the way for new geometric observational tests of possible deviations from standard cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Our paper introduces a new theoretical framework called the Fractional Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has important physical implications. Using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral, we derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein--Gordon equation. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and a logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss--Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss--Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive Black Hole Shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.48 \pm 0.17$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Induced Inflation in the Minimal Quartic Extension of Einstein's Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficient $e$-foldings.</description>

      <title>Constraints on electrophilic scalar coupling from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultralight electrophilic scalar field can produce a long-range Yukawa-like spatial profile around a rotating, magnetized star when coupled to the constant number density of electrons in either the magnetosphere or the star itself. This long-range scalar field generates an effective scalar charge in the star or its magnetosphere, leading to a long-range force between two compact stars in a binary system. The electrophilic scalar can also radiate from isolated pulsars or double pulsar binary systems. Using the Crab pulsar and PSR J0737-3039A/B as test cases, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron coupling by analyzing observations of long-range force, orbital period decay in binary systems, and pulsar spin-down rates. Among these, the most stringent limits on the coupling are obtained from the orbital period decay. However, these constraints can be significantly reduced if the scalar interacts with the pervasive cosmic neutrino background. Enhancing experimental sensitivity and studying compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further strengthen these bounds.</description>

      <title>Accurate Standard Siren Cosmology with Joint Gravitational-Wave and $\gamma$-Ray Burst Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint gravitational-wave (GW) and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) observations are among the best prospects for standard siren cosmology. However, the strong selection effect for the coincident GRB detection, which is possible only for sources with small inclination angles, induces a systematic uncertainty that is currently not accounted for. We show that this severe source of bias can be removed by inferring the \emph{a priori} unknown electromagnetic detection probability directly from multimessenger data. This leads at the same time to an unbiased measurement of the Hubble constant, to constrain the properties of GRB emission, and to accurately measure the viewing angle of each source. Our inference scheme is applicable to real data already in the small-statistics regime, a scenario that might become reality in the near future. Additionally, we introduce a novel likelihood approximant for GW events which treats the dependence on distance and inclination as exact.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIII: Strong-lens candidates at all mass scales and their environments from the Hyper-Suprime Cam and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a systematic search for strong gravitational lenses using Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, focusing on galaxy-scale lenses combined with an environment analysis resulting in the identification of lensing clusters. To identify these lens candidates, we exploited our neural network (NN) from HOLISMOKES VI. During our visual grading, we also simultaneously inspected larger stamps (80'' x 80'') to identify large, extended arcs and also classify their overall environment. Here, we also re-inspected our previous lens candidates with i-Kron radii larger than 0.8''. Using the 546 visually identified lens candidates, we further defined various criteria to select the candidates in overdensities. In total, we identified 24 grade A and 138 grade B candidates that exhibit either spatially-resolved multiple images or extended, distorted arcs in the new sample. Furthermore, combining our different techniques to determine overdensities, we identified a total of 231/546 lens candidates by at least one of our three identification methods for overdensities. This new sample contains only 49 group- or cluster-scale re-discoveries, while 43 systems had been identified by all three procedures. Furthermore, we performed a statistical analysis by using the NN from HOLISMOKES IX to model these systems, making this the largest uniformly modeled sample to date. We find a tendency towards larger Einstein radii for galaxy-scale systems in overdense environments. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying NNs to hundreds of million cutouts, while resulting in a sample size that can be visually inspected by humans. These deep learning pipelines, with false-positive rates of ~0.01%, are very powerful tools to identify such rare galaxy-scale strong lensing systems, while also aiding in the discovery of new strong lensing clusters.</description>

      <title>Searching for a dark matter induced galactic axion gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultra-light axion with CP violating interactions with a dark sector and CP preserving interactions with the visible sector can act as a novel portal between dark matter and the Standard Model. In such theories, dark matter sources an axion field extending over the entire galaxy, the gradient of which can be searched for with precise spin precession experiments. A reinterpretation of existing co-magnetometer data already constrains theories that are consistent with astrophysical bounds, and near-future experiments will begin probing well-motivated models. The required interactions can arise from a confining hidden sector without necessitating fine-tuning of the axion's mass.</description>

      <title>Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.</description>

      <title>Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the $z&gt;10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\sigma$ variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\sigma$ variances are significantly increased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at $z\simeq5.6$.}</description>
