      <title>A congruence subgroup property for symmetric mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the congruence subgroup property for the centralizer of a finite subgroup $G$ in the mapping class group of a hyperbolic oriented and connected surface of finite topological type $S$ such that the genus of the quotient surface $S/G$ is at most $2$. As an application, we show that torsion elements in the mapping class group of a surface of genus $\leq 2$ are conjugacy distinguished.</description>

      <title>Topological Representational Similarity Analysis in Brains and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain represents and processes information is crucial for advancing neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) has been instrumental in characterizing neural representations, but traditional RSA relies solely on geometric properties, overlooking crucial topological information. This thesis introduces Topological RSA (tRSA), a novel framework combining geometric and topological properties of neural representations.
  tRSA applies nonlinear monotonic transforms to representational dissimilarities, emphasizing local topology while retaining intermediate-scale geometry. The resulting geo-topological matrices enable model comparisons robust to noise and individual idiosyncrasies. This thesis introduces several key methodological advances: (1) Topological RSA (tRSA) for identifying computational signatures and testing topological hypotheses; (2) Adaptive Geo-Topological Dependence Measure (AGTDM) for detecting complex multivariate relationships; (3) Procrustes-aligned Multidimensional Scaling (pMDS) for revealing neural computation stages; (4) Temporal Topological Data Analysis (tTDA) for uncovering developmental trajectories; and (5) Single-cell Topological Simplicial Analysis (scTSA) for characterizing cell population complexity.
  Through analyses of neural recordings, biological data, and neural network simulations, this thesis demonstrates the power and versatility of these methods in understanding brains, computational models, and complex biological systems. They not only offer robust approaches for adjudicating among competing models but also reveal novel theoretical insights into the nature of neural computation. This work lays the foundation for future investigations at the intersection of topology, neuroscience, and time series analysis, paving the way for more nuanced understanding of brain function and dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Rank-$N$ Dimer Models on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The web trace theorem of Douglas, Kenyon, Shi expands the twisted Kasteleyn determinant in terms of traces of webs. We generalize this theorem to higher genus surfaces and expand the twisted Kasteleyn matrices corresponding to spin structures on the surface, analogously to the rank-1 case of Cimasoni, Reshetikhin. In the process of the proof, we give an alternate geometric derivation of the planar web trace theorem, relying on the spin geometry of embedded loops and a `racetrack construction' used to immerse loops in the blowup graph on the surface.</description>

      <title>Lannes' $T$-functor and mod-$p$ cohomology of profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lannes-Quillen theorem relates the mod-$p$ cohomology of a finite group $G$ with the mod-$p$ cohomology of centralizers of abelian elementary $p$-subgroups of $G$, for $p&gt;0$ a prime number. This theorem was extended to profinite groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology algebra is finitely generated by Henn. In a weaker form, the Lannes-Quillen theorem was then extended by Symonds to arbitrary profinite groups. Building on Symonds' result, we formulate and prove a full version of this theorem for all profinite groups. For this purpose, we develop a theory of products for families of discrete torsion modules, parameterized by a profinite space, which is dual, in a very precise sense, to the theory of coproducts for families of profinite modules, parameterized by a profinite space, developed by Haran, Melnikov and Ribes. In the last section, we give applications to the problem of conjugacy separability of $p$-torsion elements and finite $p$-subgroups.</description>

      <title>Center of stated SL($n$)-skein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we show some properties of (reduced) stated SL($n$)-skein algebras related to their centers for essentially bordered pb surfaces, especially their centers, finitely generation over their centers, and their PI-degrees. The proofs are based on the quantum trace maps, embeddings of (reduced) stated SL($n$)-skein algebras into quantum tori appearing in higher Teichm\"uller theory. Thanks to the Unicity theorem in [BG02, FKBL19], we can understand the representation theory of (reduced) stated SL($n$)-skein algebras. Moreover, the applications are beyond low-dimensional topology. For example, we can access to the representation theory of unrestricted quantum moduli algebras, and that of quantum higher cluster algebras potentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain orientation-preserving involutions on three-dimensional small covers. We prove that the quotient space of an orientable three-dimensional small cover by such an involution belonging to the 2-torus is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \times S^1$. If this quotient space is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in terms of the polytope and the characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Skein and cluster algebras of unpunctured surfaces for $\mathfrak{sp}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing to our previous work [IY21](arXiv:2101.00643) on the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-case, we introduce a skein algebra $\mathscr{S}_{\mathfrak{sp}_4,\Sigma}^{q}$ consisting of $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs on a marked surface $\Sigma$ with certain "clasped" skein relations at special points, and investigate its cluster nature. We also introduce a natural $\mathbb{Z}_q$-form $\mathscr{S}_{\mathfrak{sp}_4,\Sigma}^{\mathbb{Z}_q} \subset \mathscr{S}_{\mathfrak{sp}_4,\Sigma}^q$, while the natural coefficient ring $\mathcal{R}$ of $\mathscr{S}_{\mathfrak{sp}_4,\Sigma}^q$ includes the inverse of the quantum integer $[2]_q$. We prove that its boundary-localization $\mathscr{S}_{\mathfrak{sp}_4,\Sigma}^{\mathbb{Z}_q}[\partial^{-1}]$ is included into a quantum cluster algebra $\mathscr{A}^q_{\mathfrak{sp}_4,\Sigma}$ that quantizes the function ring of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{Sp_4,\Sigma}^\times$. Moreover, we obtain the positivity of Laurent expressions of elevation-preserving webs in a similar way to [IY21](arXiv:2101.00643). We also propose a characterization of cluster variables in the spirit of Fomin--Pylyavksyy [FP16](arXiv:1210.1888) in terms of the $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs, and give infinitely many supporting examples on a quadrilateral.</description>

      <title>A unified Casson-Lin invariant for the real forms of SL(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for counting representations of knot groups into $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. For a knot $K$ in the 3-sphere, Lin and others showed that a Casson-style count of $SU(2)$ representations with fixed meridional holonomy recovers the signature function of $K$. For knots whose complement contains no closed essential surface, we show there is an analogous count for $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representations. We then prove the $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ count is determined by the $SU(2)$ count and a single integer $h(K)$, allowing us to show the existence of various $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representations using only elementary topological hypotheses.
  Combined with the translation extension locus of Culler-Dunfield, we use this to prove left-orderability of many 3-manifold groups obtained by cyclic branched covers and Dehn fillings on broad classes of knots. We give further applications to the existence of real parabolic representations, including a generalization of the Riley Conjecture (proved by Gordon) to alternating knots. These invariants exhibit some intriguing patterns that deserve explanation, and we include many open questions.
  The close connection between $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ comes from viewing their representations as the real points of the appropriate $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety. While such real loci are typically highly singular at the reducible characters that are common to both $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, in the relevant situations, we show how to resolve these real algebraic sets into smooth manifolds. We construct these resolutions using the geometric transition $S^2 \to \mathbb{E}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^2$, studied from the perspective of projective geometry, and they allow us to pass between Casson-Lin counts of $SU(2)$ and $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representations unimpeded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09289v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of L\^{e} and Sikora by providing a comparison between various existing $SL_n$ skein theories. While doing so, we show that the full subcategory of the spider category, $\mathcal{S}p(SL_n)$, defined by Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison, whose objects are monoidally generated by the standard representation and its dual, is equivalent as a spherical braided category to Sikora's quotient category. This also answers a question from Morrison's Ph.D. thesis. Finally, we show that the skein modules associated to the CKM and Sikora's webs are isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a skein model for the quantum cluster algebras of surface type with coefficients. We introduce a skein algebra $\mathscr{S}_{\Sigma,\mathbb{W}}^{A}$ of a walled surface $(\Sigma,\mathbb{W})$, and prove that it has a quantum cluster structure. The walled surfaces naturally generalize the marked surfaces with multi-laminations, which have been used to describe the quantum cluster algebras of geometric type for marked surfaces by Fomin--Thurston [FT18]. Moreover, we give skein theoretic interpretation for some of quasi-homomorphisms [Fra16] between these quantum cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that pseudo-Anosov mapping classes are generic in every Cayley graph of the mapping class group of a finite-type hyperbolic surface. Our method also yields an analogous result for rank-one CAT(0) groups and hierarchically hyperbolic groups with Morse elements. Finally, we prove that Morse elements are generic in every Cayley graph of groups that are quasi-isometric to (well-behaved) hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This gives a quasi-isometry invariant theory of counting group elements in groups beyond relatively hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Graphically discrete groups and rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of graphical discreteness to group theory. A finitely generated group is graphically discrete if whenever it acts geometrically on a locally finite graph, the automorphism group of the graph is compact-by-discrete. Notable examples include finitely generated nilpotent groups, most lattices in semisimple Lie groups, and irreducible non-geometric 3-manifold groups. We show graphs of groups with graphically discrete vertex groups frequently have strong rigidity properties. We prove free products of one-ended virtually torsion-free graphically discrete groups are action rigid within the class of virtually torsion-free groups. We also prove quasi-isometric rigidity for many hyperbolic graphs of groups whose vertex groups are closed hyperbolic manifold groups and whose edge groups are non-elementary quasi-convex subgroups. This includes the case of two hyperbolic 3-manifold groups amalgamated along a quasi-convex malnormal non-abelian free subgroup. We provide several additional examples of graphically discrete groups and illustrate this property is not a commensurability invariant.</description>

Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>Dimer face polynomials in knot theory and cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The set of perfect matchings of a connected bipartite plane graph $G$ has the structure of a distributive lattice, as shown by Propp, where the partial order is induced by the height of a matching. In this article, our focus is the dimer face polynomial of $G$, which is the height generating function of all perfect matchings of $G$. We connect the dimer face polynomial on the one hand to knot theory, and on the other to cluster algebras. We show that certain dimer face polynomials are multivariate generalizations of Alexander polynomials of links, highlighting another combinatorial view of the Alexander polynomial. We also show that an arbitrary dimer face polynomial is an $F$-polynomial in the cluster algebra whose initial quiver is dual to the graph $G$. As a result, we recover a recent representation theoretic result of Bazier-Matte and Schiffler that connects $F$-polynomials and Alexander polynomials, albeit from a very different, dimer-based perspective. As another application of our results, we also show that all nonvanishing Pl\"ucker coordinates on open positroid varieties are cluster monomials.</description>
