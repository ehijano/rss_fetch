      <title>On the Size of the Mission Suite Enabled by NASA's Deep Space Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is the primary means of commanding, tracking, and receiving data from all of NASA's deep space missions, as well as a number of deep space missions operated by other international space agencies. The current number of missions enabled by the DSN is approximately 40 missions, but there has been concern about the level of "over-subscription" of the DSN, namely that the number of missions currently using the DSN is larger than can be enabled reasonably. This manuscript assesses the maximum number of missions that could be enabled, based on recent performance and with the constraint that the total number of hours used per week does not exceed the available number of DSN antenna-hours. Three different models are considered, and the maximal number of missions that could be enabled ranges between approximately 40 missions and 70 missions, assuming that there continues to be approximately six Mars missions and that those Mars missions continue to make use of the DSN's multiple spacecraft per antenna (MSPA) capability. Crucially, the conclusion that an approximately 50% growth in the DSN mission suite rests on the assumption that the DSN antennas are "interchangeable," but they are not, with some spacecraft able to use only certain antennas. Efforts to make the DSN antennas more "interchangeable," primarily in their transmitter and receiver suites, would be an effective means of ensuring expanded capability. Additional findings from this work are that, while additional use of the MSPA capability might appear to be a promising means for increasing the mission suite, there appear to be no locations in the Solar System, other than Mars, for which it would be effective.</description>

      <title>SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.</description>
