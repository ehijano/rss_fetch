      <title>Haptic Stylus vs. Handheld Controllers: A Comparative Study for Surface Visualization Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface visualizations are essential in analyzing three-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena. Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) is an essential medium for surface visualization and interaction tasks. Such tasks primarily rely on visual cues that require an unoccluded view of the surface region under consideration. Haptic force feedback is a tangible interaction modality that alleviates the reliance on visual-only cues by allowing a direct physical sensation of the surface. In this paper, we evaluate the use of a force-based haptic stylus compared to handheld VR controllers via a between-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across both modalities, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took longer to brush curves using the haptic modality but could draw smoother curves compared to the handheld controllers. In contrast, haptics was faster in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant feedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share takeaways to help outline design strategies for using haptics-based tangible inputs for surface visualization and interaction tasks.</description>

      <title>PRM: Photometric Stereo based Large Reconstruction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PRM, a novel photometric stereo based large reconstruction model to reconstruct high-quality meshes with fine-grained local details. Unlike previous large reconstruction models that prepare images under fixed and simple lighting as both input and supervision, PRM renders photometric stereo images by varying materials and lighting for the purposes, which not only improves the precise local details by providing rich photometric cues but also increases the model robustness to variations in the appearance of input images. To offer enhanced flexibility of images rendering, we incorporate a real-time physically-based rendering (PBR) method and mesh rasterization for online images rendering. Moreover, in employing an explicit mesh as our 3D representation, PRM ensures the application of differentiable PBR, which supports the utilization of multiple photometric supervisions and better models the specular color for high-quality geometry optimization. Our PRM leverages photometric stereo images to achieve high-quality reconstructions with fine-grained local details, even amidst sophisticated image appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRM significantly outperforms other models.</description>

      <title>SimVS: Simulating World Inconsistencies for Robust View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel-view synthesis techniques achieve impressive results for static scenes but struggle when faced with the inconsistencies inherent to casual capture settings: varying illumination, scene motion, and other unintended effects that are difficult to model explicitly. We present an approach for leveraging generative video models to simulate the inconsistencies in the world that can occur during capture. We use this process, along with existing multi-view datasets, to create synthetic data for training a multi-view harmonization network that is able to reconcile inconsistent observations into a consistent 3D scene. We demonstrate that our world-simulation strategy significantly outperforms traditional augmentation methods in handling real-world scene variations, thereby enabling highly accurate static 3D reconstructions in the presence of a variety of challenging inconsistencies.

      <title>GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has changed the game for real-time photo-realistic rendering. One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to create animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed the boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main limitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as a webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a Gaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or video and fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports 360$^\circ$ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference, enabling real-time application. Through our method, we obtain high-quality, animatable Avatars from limited data which can be animated and rendered at 70fps on commercial hardware. See our project page (https://microsoft.github.io/GASP/) for results.</description>

      <title>SAT: Spatial Aptitude Training for Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial perception is a fundamental component of intelligence. While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only test for static spatial reasoning, such as categorizing the relative positions of objects. Meanwhile, real-world deployment requires dynamic capabilities like perspective-taking and egocentric action recognition. As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K question-answer pairs for 22K synthetic scenes across a training and testing set. Generated using a photo-realistic physics engine, our dataset can be arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets. We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT, but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks: $23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning.

      <title>Make-A-Texture: Fast Shape-Aware Texture Generation in 3 Seconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Make-A-Texture, a new framework that efficiently synthesizes high-resolution texture maps from textual prompts for given 3D geometries. Our approach progressively generates textures that are consistent across multiple viewpoints with a depth-aware inpainting diffusion model, in an optimized sequence of viewpoints determined by an automatic view selection algorithm.
  A significant feature of our method is its remarkable efficiency, achieving a full texture generation within an end-to-end runtime of just 3.07 seconds on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, significantly outperforming existing methods. Such an acceleration is achieved by optimizations in the diffusion model and a specialized backprojection method. Moreover, our method reduces the artifacts in the backprojection phase, by selectively masking out non-frontal faces, and internal faces of open-surfaced objects.
  Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Texture matches or exceeds the quality of other state-of-the-art methods. Our work significantly improves the applicability and practicality of texture generation models for real-world 3D content creation, including interactive creation and text-guided texture editing.</description>
