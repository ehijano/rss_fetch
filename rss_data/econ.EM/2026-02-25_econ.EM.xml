      <title>Using Prior Studies to Design Experiments: An Empirical Bayes Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an empirical Bayes framework for experimental design that leverages information from prior related studies. When a researcher has access to estimates from previous studies on similar parameters, they can use empirical Bayes to estimate an informative prior over the parameter of interest in the new study. We show how this prior can be incorporated into a decision-theoretic experimental design framework to choose optimal design. The approach is illustrated via propensity score designs in stratified randomized experiments. Our theoretical results show that the empirical Bayes design achieves oracle-optimal performance as the number of prior studies grows, and characterize the rate at which regret vanishes. To illustrate the approach, we present two empirical applications--oncology drug trials and the Tennessee Project STAR experiment. Our framework connects the Bayesian meta-analysis literature to experimental design and provides practical guidance for researchers seeking to design more efficient experiments.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Group Bias in Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) are increasingly estimated using machine learning models that produce highly personalized predictions of treatment effects. In practice, however, predicted treatment effects are rarely interpreted, reported, or audited at the individual level but, instead, are often aggregated to broader subgroups, such as demographic segments, risk strata, or markets. We show that such aggregation can induce systematic bias of the group-level causal effect: even when models for predicting the individual-level conditional average treatment effect (CATE) are correctly specified and trained on data from randomized experiments, aggregating the predicted CATEs up to the group level does not, in general, recover the corresponding group average treatment effect (GATE). We develop a unified statistical framework to detect and mitigate this form of group bias in randomized experiments. We first define group bias as the discrepancy between the model-implied and experimentally identified GATEs, derive an asymptotically normal estimator, and then provide a simple-to-implement statistical test. For mitigation, we propose a shrinkage-based bias-correction, and show that the theoretically optimal and empirically feasible solutions have closed-form expressions. The framework is fully general, imposes minimal assumptions, and only requires computing sample moments. We analyze the economic implications of mitigating detected group bias for profit-maximizing personalized targeting, thereby characterizing when bias correction alters targeting decisions and profits, and the trade-offs involved. Applications to large-scale experimental data at major digital platforms validate our theoretical results and demonstrate empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Discount Factors with Cross-Asset Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework that links firm-level predictive signals, cross-asset spillovers, and the stochastic discount factor (SDF). Signals and spillovers are jointly estimated by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, yielding an interpretable SDF that both ranks characteristic relevance and uncovers the direction of predictive influence across assets. Out-of-sample, the SDF consistently outperforms self-predictive and expected-return benchmarks across investment universes and market states. The inferred information network highlights large, low-turnover firms as net transmitters. The framework offers a clear, economically grounded view of the informational architecture underlying cross-sectional return dynamics.</description>

      <title>Information Based Inference in Models with Set-Valued Predictions and Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an information-based inference method for partially identified parameters in incomplete models that is valid both when the model is correctly specified and when it is misspecified. Key features of the method are: (i) it is based on minimizing a suitably defined Kullback-Leibler information criterion that accounts for incompleteness of the model and delivers a non-empty pseudo-true set; (ii) it is computationally tractable; (iii) its implementation is the same for both correctly and incorrectly specified models; (iv) it exploits all information provided by variation in discrete and continuous covariates; (v) it relies on Rao's score statistic, which is shown to be asymptotically pivotal.</description>

      <title>Identification of Average Responses with Endogenous Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control variables are routinely treated as exogenous, yet in many empirical settings they are themselves endogenous. This creates a dilemma: omitting controls may leave the treatment endogenous, while including them may contaminate identification. The problem is not resolved by instrumental variables when they are only conditionally valid. We show that average responses to the treatment remain identified under a rank condition called measurable separability, which accommodates endogenous controls. For parametric models, our approach amounts to estimating a nonparametric model that nests the parametric specification. For nonparametric models, our results imply that endogenous controls are generally innocuous under standard identification conditions, except in the presence of "bad controls". We further propose a test for endogenous controls. Simulation results and an empirical application demonstrate this prevalent issue and provide practical implications of our methods.</description>

      <title>Local projections identify the same policy counterfactuals as empirical and structural models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study policy counterfactuals that impose path restrictions on a policy instrument over a finite window. Under a sequential intervention design, we define two counterfactual objects, policy-peg impulse responses and policy-path effects, and we provide a novel local projection identification method. Under policy invariance and a linear moving average envelope, the local projection estimands coincide with the counterfactual outcomes implied by empirical vector autoregressions and linearized forward looking structural models, and the counterfactual outcomes are fully characterized by the relevant impulse responses. We also provide local projection identification of both counterfactual objects under an one-shot intervention design. In the empirical applications, we quantify the propagation of an oil-supply news shock under interest-rate pegs and study alternative liftoff paths during the post-pandemic tightening episode.</description>

      <title>Sparse VARs Do Not Imply Sparse Local Projections: Robust Inference for High-Dimensional Granger Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies multi-horizon Granger causality using high-dimensional local projections in sparse Vector Autoregressive (VAR) systems. Since local projection coefficients are nonlinear transformations of the underlying VAR parameters, existing approaches, such as de-biased least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and post-double-selection methods applied directly to local projections, lack a general justification, as sparsity of the VAR does not always propagate to higher horizons. We propose a two-step framework that avoids imposing sparsity at each horizon and delivers valid inference without relying on heteroskedasticityand autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) corrections. We establish large sample theory for the proposed estimators and develop feasible Wald tests. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate improved size control across horizons relative to existing methods. An application to large financial systems illustrates horizon-specific connectedness.</description>

      <title>A Neyman-Orthogonalization Approach to the Incidental Parameter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular approach to perform inference on a target parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters is to construct estimating equations that are orthogonal to the nuisance parameters, in the sense that their expected first derivative is zero. Such first-order orthogonalization allows the estimator of the nuisance parameters to converge at a slower-than-parametric rate. It may, however, not suffice when the nuisance parameters are very imprecisely estimated. Leading examples are models for panel and network data that feature fixed effects. In this paper, we show how, in the conditional-likelihood setting, estimating equations can be constructed that are orthogonal to any chosen order $q$, in that their leading $q$ expected derivatives are zero. This yields estimators of target parameters that are unaffected by the presence of nuisance parameters to order $q$. In an empirical illustration, we apply our method to a fixed-effect model of team production.</description>
