      <title>Impact of the WHO's 90-70-90 Strategy on HPV-Related Cervical Cancer Control: A Mathematical Model Evaluation in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In August 2020, the World Health Assembly approved the Global Strategy to eliminate cervical cancer, marking the first time that numerous countries committed to eliminating a form of cancer. China introduced the HPV vaccine in 2016 and has made significant advancements in both prevention and treatment strategies. However, due to the relatively late introduction of the vaccine, the burden of cervical cancer in China continues to rise. In light of this, we develop a compartmental model to assess the impact of the WHO's 90-70-90 strategy, along with adult catch-up vaccination, on the control of HPV-induced cervical cancer in China. We analyze the basic properties of the model and provide proofs of the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, and we use the MCMC algorithm to fit the number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths in China from 1990 to 2021. The estimated basic reproduction number before and after the introduction of the HPV vaccine in China is 1.5026 (95% CI: 1.4051-1.6002) and 1.0726 (95% CI: 0.9384-1.2067), respectively. The sensitivity analysis reveals that screening, as a non-pharmaceutical intervention, plays a crucial role in controlling the spread of the disease. We apply the 90-70-90 strategy to predict the future number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths in China. The results indicate that prioritizing the 70-90 target combination is the most cost-effective approach and can achieve the goal of zero new cervical cancer cases by 2061. Finally, an optimal control model is developed to explore the best implementation strategies for HPV vaccination and screening under various plausible scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simulating nationwide coupled disease and fear spread in an agent-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human behavior and disease spread evolve together over the course of any disease outbreak. We present a dynamic model of that relationship based on the coupled spread of a disease and fear of that disease, and implement this model in a simulator, EpiCast, that simulates disease spread between individuals in a realistic synthetic population. In our model, fear of the disease spreads through both in-person contact and broadcast media, driving people to adopt behaviors that reduce disease spread. In order to better understand the dynamics of our model, we create and compare a range of compartmental surrogate models to analyze the impact of including various disease states. We also compare how Epicast-simulated outbreaks unfold across a number of scenarios with different types of behavioral responses to fear and a range of different parameter values. We find that the addition of asymptomatic, exposed, and presymptomatic disease states can impact both the rate at which an outbreak progresses and its overall trajectory. In addition, the combination of non-local fear spread through broadcasters and strong preventative measures by afraid individuals generally produces multiple epidemic waves, which only occur for a narrow range of parameter values with purely local fear spread.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and trends to equilibrium for kinetic models of opinion dynamics driven by social activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new kinetic equations modeling opinion dynamics inside a population of individuals, whose propensity to interact with each other is described by their level of social activity. We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker-Planck equation with adjoint given by a Wright-Fisher-type model with time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic models for panel data: Analysis of ecological experiments with four interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an ecological context, panel data arise when time series measurements are made on a collection of ecological processes. Each process may correspond to a spatial location for field data, or to an experimental ecosystem in a designed experiment. Statistical models for ecological panel data should capture the high levels of nonlinearity, stochasticity, and measurement uncertainty inherent in ecological systems. Furthermore, the system dynamics may depend on unobservable variables. This study applies iterated particle filtering techniques to explore new possibilities for likelihood-based statistical analysis of these complex systems. We analyze data from a mesocosm experiment in which two species of the freshwater planktonic crustacean genus, Daphnia, coexist with an alga and a fungal parasite. Time series data were collected on replicated mesocosms under six treatment conditions. Iterated filtering enables maximization of the likelihood for scientifically motivated nonlinear partially observed Markov process models, providing access to standard likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, model selection and diagnostics. This toolbox allows scientists to propose and evaluate scientifically motivated stochastic dynamic models for panel data, constrained only by the requirement to write code to simulate from the model and to specify a measurement distribution describing how the system state is observed.</description>
