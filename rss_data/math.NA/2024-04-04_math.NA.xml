      <title>Analysis of a VEM-fully discrete polytopal scheme with bubble stabilisation for contact mechanics with Tresca friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work performs the convergence analysis of the polytopal nodal discretisation of contact-mechanics (with Tresca friction) recently introduced in [18] in the framework of poro-elastic models in fractured porous media. The scheme is based on a mixed formulation, using face-wise constant approximations of the Lagrange multipliers along the fracture network and a fully discrete first order nodal approximation of the displacement field. The displacement field is enriched with additional bubble degrees of freedom along the fractures to ensure the inf-sup stability with the Lagrange multiplier space. It is presented in a fully discrete formulation, which makes its study more straightforward, but also has a Virtual Element interpretation. The analysis establishes an abstract error estimate accounting for the fully discrete framework and the non-conformity of the discretisation. A first order error estimate is deduced for sufficiently smooth solutions both for the gradient of the displacement field and the Lagrange multiplier. A key difficulty of the numerical analysis is the proof of a discrete inf-sup condition, which is based on a non-standard $H^{-1/2}$-norm (to deal with fracture networks) and involves the jump of the displacements, not their traces. The analysis also requires the proof of a discrete Korn inequality for the discrete displacement field which takes into account fracture networks. Numerical experiments based on analytical solutions confirm our theoretical findings</description>

      <title>Krylov-based Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Stiff Problems with Application to Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Kinetic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high order adaptive-rank implicit integrators for stiff time-dependent PDEs, leveraging extended Krylov subspaces to efficiently and adaptively populate low-rank solution bases. This allows for the accurate representation of solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. We further introduce an efficient mechanism for residual evaluation and an adaptive rank-seeking strategy that optimizes low-rank settings based on a comparison between the residual size and the local truncation errors of the time-stepping discretization. We demonstrate our approach with the challenging Lenard-Bernstein Fokker-Planck (LBFP) nonlinear equation, which describes collisional processes in a fully ionized plasma. The preservation of {the equilibrium state} is achieved through the Chang-Cooper discretization, and strict conservation of mass, momentum and energy via a Locally Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) procedure. The development of implicit adaptive-rank integrators, demonstrated here up to third-order temporal accuracy via diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes, showcases superior performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, equilibrium preservation, and conservation of macroscopic moments. This study offers a starting point for developing scalable, efficient, and accurate methods for high-dimensional time-dependent problems.</description>

      <title>A primal-dual adaptive finite element method for total variation based motion estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on previous work we extend a primal-dual semi-smooth Newton method for minimizing a general $L^1$-$L^2$-$TV$ functional over the space of functions of bounded variations by adaptivity in a finite element setting. For automatically generating an adaptive grid we introduce indicators based on a-posteriori error estimates. Further we discuss data interpolation methods on unstructured grids in the context of image processing and present a pixel-based interpolation method. For the computation of optical flow we derive an adaptive finite element coarse-to-fine scheme for resolving large displacements. The coarse-to-fine scheme speeds-up the computing time tremendously.</description>

      <title>An adaptive heavy ball method for ill-posed inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider ill-posed inverse problems, both linear and nonlinear, by a heavy ball method in which a strongly convex regularization function is incorporated to detect the feature of the sought solution. We develop ideas on how to adaptively choose the step-sizes and the momentum coefficients to achieve acceleration over the Landweber-type method. We then analyze the method and establish its regularization property when it is terminated by the discrepancy principle. Various numerical results are reported which demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the Landweber-type method by reducing substantially the required number of iterations and the computational time.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Geometric Multigrid Preconditioning Of Combined Newton-GMRES For Solving Phase-Field Fracture With Local Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the matrix-free solution of quasi-static phase-field fracture problems is further investigated. More specifically, we consider a quasi-monolithic formulation in which the irreversibility constraint is imposed with a primal-dual active set method. The resulting nonlinear problem is solved with a line-search assisted Newton method. Therein, the arising linear equation systems are solved with a generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), which is preconditioned with a matrix-free geometric multigrid method including geometric local mesh refinement. Our solver is substantiated with a numerical test on locally refined meshes.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Some Nonlinear Fractional Order BVPs by Weighted Residual Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To extract the approximate solutions in the case of nonlinear fractional order differential equations with the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, the weighted residual method is embedded here. We exploit three methods such as Galerkin, Least Square, and Collocation for the efficient numerical solution of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems. Some nonlinear cases are examined for observing the maximum absolute errors by the considered methods, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of the present technique using the modified Legendre and modified Bernoulli polynomials as weight functions. The mathematical formulations and computational algorithms are more straightforward and uncomplicated to understand. Absolute errors and the graphical representation reflect that our method is more accurate and reliable.</description>

      <title>A superconvergence result in the RBF-FD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) is a meshless method that can be used to numerically solve partial differential equations. The solution procedure consists of two steps. First, the differential operator is discretised on given scattered nodes and afterwards, a global sparse matrix is assembled and inverted to obtain an approximate solution. Focusing on Polyharmonic Splines as our Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) of choice, appropriately augmented with monomials, it is well known that the truncation error of the differential operator approximation is determined by the degree of monomial augmentation. Naively, one might think that the solution error will have the same order of convergence. We present a superconvergence result that shows otherwise - for some augmentation degrees, order of convergence is higher than expected.</description>

      <title>Computational analysis of a contraction rheometer for the grade-two fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of simulating the grade-two fluid model in a geometry related to a contraction rheometer, and we provide details on several key aspects of the computation. We show how the results can be used to determine the viscosity $\nu$ from experimental data. We also explore the identifiability of the grade-two parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ from experimental data. In particular, as the flow rate varies, force data appears to be nearly the same for certain distinct pairs of values $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$; however we determine a regime for $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ for which the parameters may be identifiable with a contraction rheometer.</description>

      <title>Analysis of second-order temporal schemes for modeling flow-solute transport in unsaturated porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, second-order temporal discretizations are analyzed for solving the coupled system of infiltration and solute transport in unsaturated porous media. The Richards equation is used to describe unsaturated flow, while the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) is used for modeling solute transport. The standard finite element discretization in space is utilized and four time-stepping methods are studied. Three of these methods require an iterative resolution to solve the Richards equation in its mixed form. In the remaining method, a novel technique is proposed to linearize the system of equations in time, and the iterative processes are avoided. In this method, a free stabilized parameter is introduced. Numerical tests are conducted to analyze the accuracy and efficiency of methods. The developed linear scheme based on the optimal free parameter is accurate and performs better in terms of efficiency since it offers a considerable gain in computational time compared to the other methods. The reliability and effectiveness of the developed semi-implicit scheme are investigated using numerical experiments for modeling water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of High-Order Regularization Methods with Sums-of-Squares Taylor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order tensor methods that employ Taylor-based local models (of degree $p\ge 3$) within adaptive regularization frameworks have been recently proposed for both convex and nonconvex optimization problems. They have been shown to have superior, and even optimal, worst-case global convergence rates and local rates compared to Newton's method. Finding rigorous and efficient techniques for minimizing the Taylor polynomial sub-problems remains a challenging aspect for these algorithms. Ahmadi et al. recently introduced a tensor method based on sum-of-squares (SoS) reformulations, so that each Taylor polynomial sub-problem in their approach can be tractably minimized using semidefinite programming (SDP); however, the global convergence and complexity of their method have not been addressed for general nonconvex problems. This paper introduces an algorithmic framework that combines the Sum of Squares (SoS) Taylor model with adaptive regularization techniques for nonconvex smooth optimization problems. Each iteration minimizes an SoS Taylor model, offering a polynomial cost per iteration. For general nonconvex functions, the worst-case evaluation complexity bound is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, while for strongly convex functions, an improved evaluation complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{p}})$ is established. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global rate analysis for an adaptive regularization algorithm with a tractable high-order sub-problem in nonconvex smooth optimization, opening the way for further improvements.</description>

      <title>ANOVA-boosting for Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two algorithms for boosting random Fourier feature models for approximating high-dimensional functions. These methods utilize the classical and generalized analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition to learn low-order functions, where there are few interactions between the variables. Our algorithms are able to find an index set of important input variables and variable interactions reliably. Furthermore, we generalize already existing random Fourier feature models to an ANOVA setting, where terms of different order can be used. Our algorithms have the advantage of interpretability, meaning that the influence of every input variable is known in the learned model, even for dependent input variables. We give theoretical as well as numerical results that our algorithms perform well for sensitivity analysis. The ANOVA-boosting step reduces the approximation error of existing methods significantly.</description>

      <title>First-order PDES for Graph Neural Networks: Advection And Burgers Equation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as the preferred methodology in a multitude of domains, ranging from computer vision to computational biology, especially in contexts where data inherently conform to graph structures. While many existing methods have endeavored to model GNNs using various techniques, a prevalent challenge they grapple with is the issue of over-smoothing. This paper presents new Graph Neural Network models that incorporate two first-order Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These models do not increase complexity but effectively mitigate the over-smoothing problem. Our experimental findings highlight the capacity of our new PDE model to achieve comparable results with higher-order PDE models and fix the over-smoothing problem up to 64 layers. These results underscore the adaptability and versatility of GNNs, indicating that unconventional approaches can yield outcomes on par with established techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies an imaging problem in the diffusive ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence tomography with partial boundary measurement in an anisotropic medium. Assuming plane-wave modulation, we transform the imaging problem to an inverse problem with internal data, and derive a reconstruction procedure to recover the bioluminescent source. Subsequently, an uncertainty quantification estimate is established to assess the robustness of the reconstruction. To facilitate practical implementation, we discretize the diffusive model using the staggered grid scheme, resulting in a discrete formulation of the UMBLT inverse problem. A discrete reconstruction procedure is then presented along with a discrete uncertainty quantification estimate. Finally, the reconstruction procedure is quantitatively validated through numerical examples to demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach and estimates.</description>

      <title>Direct interpolative construction of the discrete Fourier transform as a matrix product operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT), which can be viewed as a reindexing of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), has been shown to be compressible as a low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) or quantized tensor train (QTT) operator. However, the original proof of this fact does not furnish a construction of the MPO with a guaranteed error bound. Meanwhile, the existing practical construction of this MPO, based on the compression of a quantum circuit, is not as efficient as possible. We present a simple closed-form construction of the QFT MPO using the interpolative decomposition, with guaranteed near-optimal compression error for a given rank. This construction can speed up the application of the QFT and the DFT, respectively, in quantum circuit simulations and QTT applications. We also connect our interpolative construction to the approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) by demonstrating that the AQFT can be viewed as an MPO constructed using a different interpolation scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider using Schur complements to design preconditioners for twofold and block tridiagonal saddle point problems. One type of the preconditioners are based on the nested (or recursive) Schur complement, the other is based on an additive type Schur complement after permuting the original saddle point systems. We analyze different preconditioners incorporating the exact Schur complements. We show that some of them will lead to positively stable preconditioned systems if proper signs are selected in front of the Schur complements. These positive-stable preconditioners outperform other preconditioners if the Schur complements are further approximated inexactly. Numerical experiments for a 3-field formulation of the Biot model are provided to verify our predictions.</description>

      <title>Preserving Lagrangian structure in data-driven reduced-order modeling of large-scale dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a nonintrusive physics-preserving method to learn reduced-order models (ROMs) of Lagrangian systems, which includes nonlinear wave equations. Existing intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches construct structure-preserving Lagrangian ROMs by projecting the Euler-Lagrange equations of the full-order model (FOM) onto a linear subspace. This Galerkin projection step requires complete knowledge about the Lagrangian operators in the FOM and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Lagrangian operator inference approach embeds the mechanics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying Lagrangian structure. The proposed approach exploits knowledge of the governing equations (but not their discretization) to define the form and parametrization of a Lagrangian ROM which can then be learned from projected snapshot data. The method does not require access to FOM operators or computer code. The numerical results demonstrate Lagrangian operator inference on an Euler-Bernoulli beam model, the sine-Gordon (nonlinear) wave equation, and a large-scale discretization of a soft robot fishtail with 779,232 degrees of freedom. The learned Lagrangian ROMs generalize well, as they can accurately predict the physical solutions both far outside the training time interval, as well as for unseen initial conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel linear integration rule called $\textit{control neighbors}$ is proposed in which nearest neighbor estimates act as control variates to speed up the convergence rate of the Monte Carlo procedure on metric spaces. The main result is the $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2} n^{-s/d})$ convergence rate -- where $n$ stands for the number of evaluations of the integrand and $d$ for the dimension of the domain -- of this estimate for H\"older functions with regularity $s \in (0,1]$, a rate which, in some sense, is optimal. Several numerical experiments validate the complexity bound and highlight the good performance of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of in time approximations of hyperbolic elastodynamics via stepwise minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study step-wise time approximations of non-linear hyperbolic initial value problems. The technique used here is a generalization of the minimizing movements method, using two time-scales: one for velocity, the other (potentially much larger) for acceleration. The main applications are from elastodynamics namely so-called generalized solids, undergoing large deformations. The evolution follows an underlying variational structure exploited by step-wise minimisation.
  We show for a large family of (elastic) energies that the introduced scheme is stable; allowing for non-linearities of highest order. If the highest order can assumed to be linear, we show that the limit solutions are regular and that the minimizing movements scheme converges with optimal linear rate. Thus this work extends numerical time-step minimization methods to the realm of hyperbolic problems.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor methods for nonuniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multilinear algebra appears natural for studying the multiway interactions modeled by hypergraphs, tensor methods for general hypergraphs have been stymied by theoretical and practical barriers. A recently proposed adjacency tensor is applicable to nonuniform hypergraphs, but is prohibitively costly to form and analyze in practice. We develop tensor times same vector (TTSV) algorithms for this tensor which improve complexity from $O(n^r)$ to a low-degree polynomial in $r$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $r$ is the maximum hyperedge size. Our algorithms are implicit, avoiding formation of the order $r$ adjacency tensor. We demonstrate the flexibility and utility of our approach in practice by developing tensor-based hypergraph centrality and clustering algorithms. We also show these tensor measures offer complementary information to analogous graph-reduction approaches on data, and are also able to detect higher-order structure that many existing matrix-based approaches provably cannot.</description>

      <title>Modified memoryless spectral-scaling Broyden family on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents modified memoryless quasi-Newton methods based on the spectral-scaling Broyden family on Riemannian manifolds. The method involves adding one parameter to the search direction of the memoryless self-scaling Broyden family on the manifold. Moreover, it uses a general map instead of vector transport. This idea has already been proposed within a general framework of Riemannian conjugate gradient methods where one can use vector transport, scaled vector transport, or an inverse retraction. We show that the search direction satisfies the sufficient descent condition under some assumptions on the parameters. In addition, we show global convergence of the proposed method under the Wolfe conditions. We numerically compare it with existing methods, including Riemannian conjugate gradient methods and the memoryless spectral-scaling Broyden family. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method with the BFGS formula is suitable for solving an off-diagonal cost function minimization problem on an oblique manifold.</description>

      <title>Reduced projection method for photonic moir\'e lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a reduced projection method for the solution of quasiperiodic Schr\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problems for photonic moir\'e lattices. Using the properties of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator in higher-dimensional space via a projection matrix, we rigorously prove that the generalized Fourier coefficients of the eigenfunctions exhibit faster decay rate along a fixed direction associated with the projection matrix. An efficient reduction strategy of the basis space is then proposed to reduce the degrees of freedom significantly. Rigorous error estimates of the proposed reduced projection method are provided, indicating that a small portion of the degrees of freedom is sufficient to achieve the same level of accuracy as the classical projection method. We present numerical examples of photonic moir\'e lattices in one and two dimensions to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>The eXtended Virtual Element Method for elliptic problems with weakly singular solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel eXtended virtual element method, an extension of the conforming virtual element method. The XVEM is formulated by incorporating appropriate enrichment functions in the local spaces. The method is designed to handle highly generic enrichment functions, including singularities arising from fractured domains. By achieving consistency on the enrichment space, the method is proven to achieve arbitrary approximation orders even in the presence of singular solutions. The paper includes a complete convergence analysis under general assumptions on mesh regularity, and numerical experiments validating the method's accuracy on various mesh families, demonstrating optimal convergence rates in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms on fractured or L-shaped domains.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Multiscale Spectral Generalized Finite Element Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multiscale mixed finite element method for solving second order elliptic equations with general $L^{\infty}$-coefficients arising from flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. Our approach is based on a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) and exploits the superior local mass conservation properties of mixed finite elements. Following the MS-GFEM framework, optimal local approximation spaces are built for the velocity field by solving local eigenvalue problems over generalized harmonic spaces. The resulting global velocity space is then enriched suitably to ensure inf-sup stability. We develop the mixed MS-GFEM for both continuous and discrete formulations, with Raviart-Thomas based mixed finite elements underlying the discrete method. Exponential convergence with respect to local degrees of freedom is proven at both the continuous and discrete levels. Numerical results are presented to support the theory and to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odingerisation based computationally stable algorithms for ill-posed problems in partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and stable computational method for ill-posed partial differential equation (PDE) problems. The method is based on Schr\"odingerization, introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], which maps all linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations in one higher dimension, for quantum simulations of these PDEs. Although the original problem is ill-posed, the Schr\"odingerized equations are Hamiltonian systems and time-reversible, allowing stable computation both forward and backward in time. The original variable can be recovered by data from suitably chosen domain in the extended dimension. We will use the backward heat equation and the linear convection equation with imaginary wave speed as examples. Error analysis of these algorithms are conducted and verified numerically. The methods are applicable to both classical and quantum computers, and we also lay out quantum algorithms for these methods. Moreover, we introduce a smooth initialization for the Schr\"odingerized equation which will lead to essentially spectral accuracy for the approximation in the extended space, if a spectral method is used. Consequently, the extra qubits needed due to the extra dimension, if a qubit based quantum algorithm is used, for both well-posed and ill-posed problems, becomes almost $\log\log {1/\varepsilon}$ where $\varepsilon$ is the desired precision. This optimizes the complexity of the Schr\"odingerization based quantum algorithms for any non-unitary dynamical system introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603].</description>

      <title>Robust time-discretisation and linearisation schemes for singular and degenerate evolution systems modelling biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse numerical schemes for a system of quasilinear, degenerate evolution equations modelling biofilm growth as well as other processes such as flow through porous media and the spreading of wildfires. The first equation in the system is parabolic and exhibits degenerate and singular diffusion, while the second is either uniformly parabolic or an ordinary differential equation. First, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretisation that has the benefit of decoupling the equations. We prove the positivity, boundedness, and convergence of the time-discrete solutions to the time-continuous solution. Then, we introduce an iterative linearisation scheme to solve the resulting nonlinear time-discrete problems. Under weak assumptions on the time-step size, we prove that the scheme converges irrespective of the space discretisation and mesh. Moreover, if the problem is non-degenerate, the convergence becomes faster as the time-step size decreases. Finally, employing the finite element method for the spatial discretisation, we study the behaviour of the scheme, and compare its performance to other commonly used schemes. These tests confirm that the proposed scheme is robust and fast.</description>

      <title>Approximation and perturbations of stable solutions to a stationary mean field game system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new general approach for the numerical analysis of stable equilibria to second order  mean field games systems in cases where the uniqueness of solutions may fail. For the sake of simplicity, we focus on a simple stationary case. We propose an abstract framework to study these solutions by reformulating the mean field game system as an abstract equation in a Banach space. In this context, stable equilibria turn out to be regular solutions to this equation, meaning that the linearized system is well-posed. We provide three applications of this property: we study the sensitivity analysis of stable solutions, establish error estimates for their finite element approximations, and prove the local converge of Newton's method in infinite dimensions.</description>
