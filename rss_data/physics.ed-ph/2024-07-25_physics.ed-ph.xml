      <title>Splitting the second: Designing a physics course with an emphasis on timescales of ultrafast phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timescales spanning 24 orders of magnitude smaller than one second can be studied experimentally, and each range is packed with different physical phenomena. This rich range of timescales offers a great context for an innovative undergraduate physics course which introduces modern physics and technology from an unconventional perspective. Based on the author's experience in lecturing on these topics to different audiences, this paper proposes a syllabus of a semester-long timescale-based undergraduate physics course.</description>

      <title>The Honorific Effect: Exploring the Impact of Japanese Linguistic Formalities on AI-Generated Physics Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of Japanese honorifics on the responses of large language models (LLMs) when explaining the law of conservation of momentum. We analyzed the outputs of six state-of-the-art AI models, including variations of ChatGPT, Coral, and Gemini, using 14 different honorific forms. Our findings reveal that honorifics significantly affect the quality, consistency, and formality of AI-generated responses, demonstrating LLMs' ability to interpret and adapt to social context cues embedded in language. Notable variations were observed across different models, with some emphasizing historical context and derivations, while others focused on intuitive explanations. The study highlights the potential for using honorifics to adjust the depth and complexity of AI-generated explanations in educational contexts. Furthermore, the responsiveness of AI models to cultural linguistic elements underscores the importance of considering cultural factors in AI development for educational applications. These results open new avenues for research in AI-assisted education and cultural adaptation in AI systems, with significant implications for personalizing learning experiences and developing culturally sensitive AI tools for global education.</description>
