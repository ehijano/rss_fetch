      <title>Lagrangian Translating Solitons and Special Lagrangians in $\mathbb{C}^m$ with Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct novel families of exact immersed and embedded Lagrangian translating solitons and special Lagrangian submanifolds in $\mathbb{C}^m$ that are invariant under the action of various admissible compact subgroups $G \leq \text{SU}(m-1)$ with cohomogeneity-two. These examples are obtained via an Ansatz generalising a construction of Castro-Lerma in $\mathbb{C}^2$. We give explicit examples of admissible group actions, including a full classification for $G$ simple. We also describe novel Lagrangian translators symmetric with respect to non-compact subgroups of the affine special unitary group $\text{SU}(m)\ltimes \mathbb{C}^m$, including cohomogeneity-one examples.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Vector Bundle whose Curvature Form Solves a Polynomial Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of local perturbations of a wide class of geometric PDEs on holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles over a compact complex manifold. Our main goal is to study the existence of solutions near an initial solution under small deformations of both the holomorphic structure of the bundle and the parameters of the equation. Inspired by techniques from geometric invariant theory and the moment map framework, under suitable assumptions on the initial solution, we establish a local Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence. A perturbed bundle admits a solution to the equation if and only if it satisfies a local polystability condition. We also show additional results, such as continuity and uniqueness of solutions when they exist, and a local version of the Kempf-Ness theorem. We also provide a local version of the Jordan-H\"older and Harder-Narasimhan filtrations.</description>

      <title>Almost Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifolds and the instanton condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is observed that on a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion (ACYT) 6-manifold with co-closed Lee form the curvature of the torsion connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the torsion connection. The same conclusion holds for any (non necessarily compact) balanced ACYT 6-manifold. In particular, on a CYT 6-manifold the Strominger-Bismut connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the Strominger-Bismut connection provided either the CYT 6-manifold is compact with co-closed Lee form or it is a balanced CYT 6-manifold.</description>

      <title>Conformal Green functions and Yamabe metrics of Sobolev regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a full resolution of the Yamabe problem on closed 3-manifolds for Riemannian metrics of Sobolev class $W^{2,q}$ with $q &gt; 3$. This requires developing an elliptic theory for the conformal Laplacian for rough metrics and establishing existence, regularity and a delicate blow-up analysis for its Green function. Most of the analytical work is carried out in dimensions $n \geq 3$ and for $W^{2,q}$ Riemannian metrics with $q&gt;\tfrac{n}{2}$ and should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Spacetime reconstruction by order and number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the random adjacency matrices induced by the chronological relations and i.i.d. samples of two spacetimes coincide in law if and only if the spacetimes in question are smoothly isometric. A similar result holds for weighted spacetimes. In the smooth framework of our article, this relaxes the hypotheses of the recent Gromov reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian signature by Braun-S\"amann from a.s. isometry of the respective time separation functions to a.s. order isometry. In a probabilistic way, our result makes a key paradigm of causal set theory rigorous: spacetime can be recovered by only knowing "order" and "number" of its points. It confirms a weak version of Bombelli's conjecture; therefore, it contributes to recent efforts of formalizing the Hauptvermutung (viz. fundamental conjecture) of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the d'Alembertian from general relativity. An invitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey has multiple objectives. First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear $p$-version thereof, where $p$ is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent comparison estimates for the $p$-d'Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (notably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.</description>

      <title>How many points in a point cloud is sufficient for accurate estimation of the curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an estimator for the curvature of curves and surfaces by using finite sample points drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on the curve or surface. First we give an algorithm for estimation of the curvature in a given point of a curve. Then, we extend it to estimate the Gaussian curvature of the surfaces. In the proposed algorithms, we use a relation between the number of selected points in the point cloud and the probability that a given point has a suffcient number of nearby points. This relation allows us to control the required number of points in the point cloud.</description>

      <title>Affine Deformations of Divisible Convex Cones and Affine Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ obtained by adding a translation part to a torsion-free discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})$ dividing a convex domain in the sense of Benoist, we study two particular convex domains on which the affine action of that subgroup is free and properly discontinuous and whose quotients are naturally endowed with an "affine spacetime" structure that we introduce. In that setting, we show that those quotients are Maximal Globally Hyperbolic affine spacetimes admitting a locally uniformly Convex and Compact Cauchy surface (denoted as a MGHCC affine spacetimes), and that they come with a cosmological time function with Cauchy hypersurfaces foliating the quotient affine spacetime as level sets. Finally, we show that those are the only examples of such MGHCC affine spacetimes. All these results generalise the work of Mess, Barbot and Bonsante on affine deformations of uniform lattices of $\mathrm{SO}_0(d,1)$.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for two-phase matrix-valued harmonic map flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of weak solutions for matrix-valued two-phase harmonic map flows with optimal lifespan, which arises as the limiting system of the matrix-valued Rubinstein-Sternberg-Keller problem studied by ({\em Invent. Math.}, 233(1):1--80, 2023). Our approach employs a modified minimizing movement scheme, discretizing the time domain and constructing approximate solutions by interpolating solutions to the associated functional problem within each small time interval.</description>
