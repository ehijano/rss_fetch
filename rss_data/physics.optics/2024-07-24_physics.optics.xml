      <title>Design of cascaded diffractive optical elements generating different intensity distributions at several operating wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the design of cascaded diffractive optical elements (DOEs) for generating specified intensity distributions for several incident beams with different wavelengths. For each incident beam with a given wavelength, the cascaded DOE forms a different specified intensity distribution. The problem of DOE design is formulated as the problem of minimizing a functional that depends on the functions of diffractive microrelief height of the cascaded DOE and represents the deviations of the intensity distributions generated at the operating wavelengths from the specified ones. Explicit expressions are obtained for the derivatives of the functional, and on this basis, a gradient method for calculating a cascaded DOE is formulated. The proposed gradient method is used for the calculation of cascaded DOEs focusing radiation of three different wavelengths into different areas. In particular, the calculation of a cascaded DOE generating a complex color image of parrots is considered. The presented numerical simulation results demonstrate high performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Polaritonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons, arising from the strong coupling between excitons and photons within microcavities, hold promise for optoelectronic and all-optical devices. They have found applications in various domains, including low-threshold lasers and quantum information processing. To realize complex functionalities, non-intuitive designs for polaritonic devices are required. In this contribution, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, written in a differentiable manner, and combine it with an adjoint formulation. Such a method allows us to use topology optimization to engineer the potential landscape experienced by polariton condensates to tailor its characteristics on demand. The potential directly translates to a blueprint for a functional device, and various fabrication and optical control techniques can experimentally realize it. We inverse-design a selection of polaritonic devices, i.e., a structure that spatially shapes the polaritons into a flat-top distribution, a metalens that focuses a polariton, and a nonlinearly activated isolator. The functionalities are preserved when employing realistic fabrication constraints such as minimum feature size and discretization of the potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of inverse design techniques for polaritonic devices, providing a stepping stone toward future research in optimizing systems with complex light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Feedback Intensity Equalization for Multi-Spots Holographic Tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the high degree of adjustability, holographic tweezer array has been proved to be the best choice to create arbitrary geometries atomic array. In holographic tweezer array experiment, optical tweezer generated by spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as static tweezer array. Due to the alternating current(AC) stark shifts effect, intensity difference of traps will cause different light shift. So, the optimization of intensity equalization is very important in many-body system consist of single atoms. Here we report a work on studying of intensity equalization algorithm. Through this algorithm, the uniformity of tweezer can exceed 96% when the number of tweezer size is bigger than 1000. Our analysis shows that further uniformity requires further optimization of optical system. The realization of the intensity equalization algorithm is of great significance to the many-body experiments based on single atom array.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Characteristics of a Glide-Symmetric Square Patch Metamaterial with Giant Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dispersion characteristics of a highly anisotropic metamaterial comprised of metal square patches arranged in a glide symmetry pattern and submerged in vacuum. Theoretical formulas are proposed to describe the electromagnetic tensors of a corresponding uniaxial effective medium with dielectric and magnetic responses. In addition, this work employs theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to examine the interaction between the metamaterial and electromagnetic waves across a broad spectral range. Band diagrams and isofrequency contours show good agreement between theoretical and numerical results for low frequencies and certain directions of propagation at higher frequencies. The ease of designing the metamaterial structure for various applications is facilitated by the derived theoretical formulas, which enable accurate prediction of the electromagnetic response across a wide range of frequencies based on geometric parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, advancements in attosecond spectroscopy have allowed us to study electron motion dynamics in condensed matter. The access to these electron dynamics and, consequently, its control by an ultrafast light field paves the way for establishing ultrafast optoelectronics. Here, we report the generation of light-induced quantum tunnelling current in graphene phototransistors by ultrafast laser pulses in an ambient environment. This tunnelling effect provides access to the instantaneous field-driven current to demonstrate the current switching (ON and OFF) on a 630 attosecond (1.6 petahertz speed). Moreover, we controlled the tunnelling current and enhanced the graphene phototransistor conductivity by controlling the density of the photoexcited charge carriers at different pump laser powers. Furthermore, we exploited this capability to demonstrate various logic gates. The demonstrated light-induced tunnelling current and ultrafast switching were attained under standard room temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, the presented scientific advancement in this work is at the technology readiness level suitable for its immediate integration into the development of ultrafast, nearly six orders of magnitude faster, optical transistors, lightwave electronics, and optical quantum computers.</description>

      <title>New design paradigm for highly efficient and low noise photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high quantum efficiency (QE) with low dark count is essential for highly sensitive photodetectors (PDs), including single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs). However, high QE requires a thicker absorber region, which leads to high dark current and noise, which in turn affects the detectivity of PDs and the photodetection efficiency and dark count of SPADs.The holy grail of photodetector and avalanche photodiode designs is to achieve highest QE with thinnest absorber and still enable large avalanche to gain as needed. We have developed a new design paradigm which exploits the coupling between dielectric Mie resonance and transverse propagating waves in thin layers. The Mie resonance launches the incident light at an angle in an ultrathin absorber, and when coupled to transverse waves, the light propagates laterally and is fully absorbed owing to the longer optical path. Consequently, with appropriate choice of materials for a chosen wavelength, a high absorption(~90%) within typically &lt;100 nm absorber thickness is possible. For illustration, we apply our approach to design Si-based detector operating at 810 nm and InGaAs-based detector operating at 1550 nm and predict that the dark current at room temperature is reduced at least by two orders of magnitude. In addition, the lateral distances are often in a few microns and hence these designs can potentially enable avalanching for a large optical gain.</description>

      <title>Automated modal analysis of entanglement with bipartite self-configuring optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a unique feature of quantum mechanics. In coupled systems of light and matter, entanglement manifests itself in the linear superposition of multipartite quantum states (e.g., parametrized by the multiple spatial, spectral, or temporal degrees of freedom of a light field). In bipartite systems, the Schmidt decomposition provides a modal decomposition of the entanglement structure over independent, separable states. Although ubiquitous as a tool to describe and measure entanglement, there exists no general method to decompose a bipartite quantum state onto its Schmidt modes. Here, we propose a method that relies on bipartite self-configuring optics that automatically "learns" the Schmidt decomposition of an arbitrary pure quantum state. Our method is agnostic to the degrees of freedom over which quantum entanglement is distributed and can reconstruct the Schmidt modes and values by variational optimization of the network's output powers or coincidences. We illustrate our method with numerical examples of spectral entanglement analysis for biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion and provide experimental guidelines for its realization, including the influence of losses and impurities. Our method provides a versatile and scalable way of analyzing entanglement in bipartite integrated quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlocal modulation cancellation with distributed clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate nonlocal modulation of entangled photons with truly distributed RF clocks. Leveraging a custom radio-over-fiber (RFoF) system characterized via classical spectral interference, we validate its effectiveness for quantum networking by multiplexing the RFoF clock with one photon from a frequency-bin-entangled pair and distributing the coexisting quantum-classical signals over fiber. Phase modulation of the two photons reveals nonlocal correlations in excellent agreement with theory: in-phase modulation produces additional sidebands in the joint spectral intensity, while out-of-phase modulation is nonlocally canceled. Our simple, feedback-free design attains sub-picosecond synchronization -- namely, drift less than $\sim$0.5 ps in a 5.5 km fiber over 30 min (fractionally only $\sim$2$\times$10$^{-8}$ of the total fiber delay) -- and should facilitate frequency-encoded quantum networking protocols such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution and entanglement swapping, unlocking frequency-bin qubits for practical quantum communications in deployed metropolitan-scale networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that the spontaneous and collective emissions have a strong influence on the excitation of two-level absorbers (atoms, molecules) interacting in resonance with the plasmonic mode near the metal nanoparticle. The spontaneous and collective emissions limit the absorption enhancement by the plasmonic mode and make the enhancement possible only with a fast, picosecond population relaxation of the upper absorbing states. Conditions for the maximum of plasmon-enhanced absorption in the presence of spontaneous and collective emissions are found. The nonlinearity in the nanoparticle-absorber interaction and in collective emission causes the bistability in the plasmon-enhanced absorption at high external field intensities and the plasmonic mode excitation.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive symmetry breaking in bidirectionally pumped Kerr microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that linear coupling due to the backscattering between two counterpropagating modes in a Kerr microresonator leads to extreme sensitivity of the intensity asymmetry of nonlinear light states to the relative phase between the bidirectional pumps of equal power. In the absence of linear coupling, the relative pump phase does not affect counterpropagating intraresonator intensities, and two asymmetric states arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Contrariwise, in the presence of weak linear intermode coupling, the asymmetry of the states is deterministically controlled via changes in phase (for all phases except 0 and $\pi$). Spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero phase is suppressed when the linear intermode coupling is increased, while for the $\pi$ phase it can be enhanced, so that the overall threshold for the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be significantly lower for nonzero linear coupling. These results are important for fundamental understanding of the processes in Kerr resonators and other systems with Kerr-like nonlinearities and linear intermode coupling and have high prospects for the development of photonic devices such as ultrasensitive sensors.</description>

      <title>Inverse-designed 3D laser nanoprinted phase masks to extend the depth of field of imaging systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In optical imaging, achieving high resolution often comes at the expense of a shallow depth of field. This means that when using a standard microscope, any minor movement of the object along the optical axis can cause the image to become blurry. To address this issue, we exploit inverse design techniques to optimise a phase mask which, when inserted into a standard microscope, extends the depth of field by a factor of approximately four without compromising the microscope's resolution. Differentiable Fourier optics simulations allow us to rapidly iterate towards an optimised design in a hybrid fashion, starting with gradient-free Bayesian optimisation and proceeding to a local gradient-based optimisation. To fabricate the device, a commercial two-photon 3D laser nanoprinter is used, in combination with a two-step pre-compensation routine, providing high fabrication speed and much better than subwavelength accuracy. We find excellent agreement between our numerical predictions and the measurements upon integrating the phase mask into a microscope and optically characterising selected samples. The phase mask enables us to conduct simultaneous multiplane imaging of objects separated by distances that cannot be achieved with the original microscope.</description>

      <title>Self-driving lab discovers principles for steering spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72{\deg} field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.</description>

Abstract: We found that fluctuations in the number of emitters lead to a super-thermal photon statistics of small LEDs in a linear regime, with a strong emitter-field coupling and a bad cavity favorable for collective effects. A simple analytical expression for the second-order correlation function g_2 is found. g_2 increase up to g_2=6 in the two-level LED model is predicted. The super-thermal photon statistics is related to the population fluctuation increase of the spontaneous emission to the cavity mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical parameters of electron bunches available now in undulator X-ray FELs enable generation of induced radiation in crystal-based X-ray VFEL. An important peculiarity of an undulator X-ray FEL is electron bunch spatial modulation with the period equal to the wavelength of the produced radiation. Therefore, XFEL can be considered as a modulator of electron bunch density. As a result a facility combining an undulator, which produced a modulated beam, and a crystal, on which the modulated beam is incident, can be considered to be similar to klystron, which is a well-known source for microwaves emission. Use of pre-modulated beams enables to generate and observe superradiation and induced radiation in a crystal-based X-ray VFEL.</description>

      <title>Infinite Series Solution of the Time-Dependent Radiative Transfer Equation in Anisotropically Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in anisotropically scattering media as an infinite series. Each series term represents a distinct number of scattering events, with analytical solutions derived for zero and single scattering. Higher-order corrections are addressed through numerical calculations or approximations.
  The RTE solution corresponds to Monte Carlo sampling of photon trajectories with fixed start and end points.
  Validated against traditional Monte Carlo simulations, featuring random end points, our solution demonstrates enhanced efficiency for both anisotropic and isotropic scattering functions, significantly reducing computational time and resources.
  The advantage of our method over Monte Carlo simulations varies with the position of interest and the asymmetry of light scattering, but it is typically orders of magnitude faster while achieving the same level of accuracy.
  The exploitation of hidden symmetries further accelerates our numerical calculations, enhancing the method's overall efficiency.
  In addition, we extend our analysis to the first and second moments of the photon's flux, elucidating the transition between transport and diffusive regimes.</description>

Abstract: Optical beam deflection is a popular method to measure the deformation of micromechanical devices. As it measures mostly a local slope, its sensitivity depends on the location and size of the optical spot. We present a method to evaluate precisely these parameters, using the relative amplitude of the thermal noise induced vibrations. With a case study of a microcantilever, we demonstrate the accuracy of the approach, as well as its ability to fully characterize the sensitivity of the detector and the parameters (mass, stiffness) of the resonator.</description>

      <title>On the development of an RFSoC-based ultra-fast Phasemeter with GHz bandwidth</title>

Abstract: Precise measurements of the frequency and phase of an electrical or optical signal play a key role in various branches of science and engineering. Tracking changing laser frequencies is especially demanding when the lasers themselves are noisy or if the frequencies rapidly change because they encode highly dynamic signals in, e.g., Doppler-ranging or dynamic cavity readout. Here, to address these and other possible applications, we report the development of a high signal bandwidth (&gt; 2 GHz) and high tracking bandwidth (2 MHz) multi-channel Phasemeter. The implementation utilizes an all-digital phase-locked loop realized within the field programmable gate array (FPGA) part of a Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC), the programmable logic (PL). The new features of the phasemeter are obtained by operating the PL at its timing limits and introducing a multi-demodulation and phase accumulation scheme. We present performance measurements, discuss the role of the high tracking bandwidth for tracking highly dynamic signals, and demonstrate ultra-stable phase locking of a beat note between two widely tunable external cavity diode lasers. We achieve a phase-noise floor in the sub-milli radian regime when comparing two signals, even for GHz frequencies, and demonstrate stable tracking of signals with a frequency change rate of 240 GHz/s.</description>

      <title>Phonon Directionality Impacts Electron-Phonon Coupling and Polarization of the Band-Edge Emission in Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metal-halide perovskites are highly versatile for light-driven applications due to their exceptional variety in material composition, which can be exploited for tunability of mechanical and optoelectronic properties. The band edge emission is defined by structure and composition of both organic and inorganic layers, and electron-phonon coupling plays a crucial role in the recombination dynamics. However, the nature of the electron-phonon coupling and which kind of phonons are involved is still under debate. Here we investigate the emission, reflectance and phonon response from single two-dimensional lead-iodide microcrystals with angle-resolved polarized spectroscopy. We find an intricate dependence of the emission polarization with the vibrational directionality in the materials, which reveals that several bands of the low-frequency phonons with non-orthogonal directionality contribute to the band edge emission. Such complex electron-phonon coupling requires adequate models to predict the thermal broadening of the emission and provides opportunities to design its polarization properties.</description>
