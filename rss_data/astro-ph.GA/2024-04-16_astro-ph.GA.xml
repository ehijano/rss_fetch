      <title>Dissecting the Interstellar Media of A Wolf-Rayet Galaxy at $z=2.76$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report JWST/NIRSpec observations of a star-forming galaxy at $z=2.76$, MACSJ1149-WR1. We securely detect two temperature-sensitive auroral lines, [SIII]6312 (7.4$\sigma$) and [OII]7320+7331 doublets (10$\sigma$), and tentatively [NII]5755 ($2.3\sigma$) for the first time in an individual galaxy at $z&gt;1$. We perform a detailed analysis of its interstellar media (ISM), and derive electron temperatures, various heavy element abundances (O/H, N/O, S/O, and Ar/O) in the hot ionized region, and the neutral fraction in the warm ionized region. MACSJ1149-WR1 shows a broad feature at the wavelength of HeII 4686, which consists of a broad ($\sim1000$km/s), blue-shifted ($\sim-110$km/s) line component. Taken together with its mildly elevated N/O abundance, we conclude that MACSJ1149-WR1 is experiencing a young starburst ($&lt;10$Myr), likely hosting a large number of Wolf-Rayet stars. None of its spectral features support the presence of AGN, including: $(i)$ the absence of broad components and velocity shifts in Hydrogen recombination lines, $(ii)$ low [FeII]${\rm 1.257 \mu m}$/Pa$\beta$ ratio, and $(iii)$ the absence of high-ionization lines. Our analysis using HeI lines reveals a higher electron temperature and a higher attenuation value, indicating that HeI may probe a smaller spatial scale than HI, presumably the region dominated by the aforementioned Wolf-Rayet stars. The star formation rates derived from various HeI lines broadly agree with those from Hydrogen recombination lines. We thus advocate that HeI can be an excellent, independent probe of multi-phase ISM in the era of JWST.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of an ionized bubble: NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the $z=6.6$ double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter COLA1 and its environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly neutral intergalactic gas at $z&gt;6$ impacts the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux observed from galaxies. One luminous galaxy, COLA1, stands out because of its unique double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ line at $z=6.6$, unseen in any simulation of reionization. Here we present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy in a 21 arcmin$^2$ field centered on COLA1. We find 141 galaxies spectroscopically-selected through the [OIII]($\lambda4969,5008$) doublet at $5.35&lt;z&lt;6.95$, with 40 of these sources showing H$\beta$. For COLA1 we additionally detect [OIII]$_{4363}$ and H$\gamma$. We measure a systemic redshift of $z=6.5917$ for COLA1, confirming the double-peak nature of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. This implies that it resides in a highly ionized bubble and that it is leaking ionizing photons with a high escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}{\rm (LyC)}=20$-$50$%, making it a prime laboratory to study Lyman continuum escape in the Epoch of Reionization. COLA1 shows all the signs of a prolific ionizer with a Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of $81\pm5\%$, Balmer decrement indicating no dust, a steep UV slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}=-3.2\pm 0.4$), and a star-formation surface density $\gtrsim 10\times$ that of typical galaxies at similar redshift. We detect 5 galaxies in COLA1's close environment ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$). Exploiting the high spectroscopic completeness inherent to grism surveys, and using mock simulations that mimic the selection function, we show the that number of detected companions is very typical for a similarly UV-bright ($M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-21.3$) galaxy; that is, the ionized bubble around COLA1 is unlikely due to an excessively large over-density. Instead, the measured ionizing properties suggest that COLA1 by itself might be powering the bubble required to explain its double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile ($R_{\rm ion}\approx0.7$ pMpc), with minor contribution from detected neighbours ($-17.5&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-19.5$).</description>

      <title>Correlations among complex organic molecules around protostars: Effects of physical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column density ratios of complex organic molecules are generally constant across protostellar systems with some low-level scatter. However, the scatter in formamide (NH$_2$CHO) to methanol (CH$_3$OH) column density ratio is one of the highest. This larger scatter is sometimes interpreted as evidence of gas-phase formation of NH$_2$CHO. In this work we propose an alternative interpretation in which this scatter is produced by differences in the snowline locations related to differences in binding energies of these species and the small-scale structure of the envelope and the disk system. We also include CH$_3$CN in our work as a control molecule which has a similar binding energy to CH$_3$OH. We use radiative transfer models to calculate the emission from these species in protostellar systems with and without disks. The abundances of these species are parameterized in our models. Then we fit the calculated emission lines to find the column densities as done in real observations. We find a correction factor of ~10 to be multiplied by gas-phase $N_{NH_2CHO}/N_{CH_3OH}$ to give the true abundance ratio of these two species in the ices. We find that models with different physical parameters produce a scatter in $N_{NH_2CHO}/N_{CH_3OH}$, comparable with that of observations. The scatter in $N_{NH_2CHO}/N_{CH_3OH}$ is larger than that of $N_{CH_3CN}/N_{CH_3OH}$ in models consistent with the observations. We show that the scatter in $N_{NH_2CHO}/N_{CH_3OH}$ will be lower if we correct for the difference in sublimation temperatures of these two species in observations of ~40 protostellar systems with ALMA. The scatter in $N_{NH_2CHO}/N_{CH_3OH}$ can be partially explained by the difference in their binding energies. We conclude that gas-phase chemistry routes for NH$_2$CHO are not necessary to explain the larger scatter of $N_{NH_2CHO}/N_{CH_3OH}$ compared with other ratios.</description>

      <title>The Environmental Dependence of the Stellar Mass - Gas Metallicity Relation in Horizon Run 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallicity offers a unique window into the baryonic history of the cosmos, being instrumental in probing evolutionary processes in galaxies between different cosmic environments. We aim to quantify the contribution of these environments to the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of galaxies. By analysing the galaxy distribution within the cosmic skeleton of the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation at redshift $z = 0.625$, computed using a careful calibration of the T-ReX filament finder, we identify galaxies within three main environments: nodes, filaments and voids. We also classify galaxies based on the dynamical state of the clusters and the length of the filaments in which they reside. We find that the cosmic environment significantly contributes to the scatter in the MZR; in particular, both the gas metallicity and its average relative standard deviation increase when considering denser large-scale environments. The difference in the average metallicity between galaxies within relaxed and unrelaxed clusters is $\approx 0.1 \text{ dex}$, with both populations displaying positive residuals, $\delta Z_{g}$, from the averaged MZR. Moreover, the difference in metallicity between node and void galaxies accounts for $\approx 0.14 \, \text{dex}$ in the scatter of the MZR at stellar mass $M_{\star} \approx 10^{9.35}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$. Finally, both the average [O/Fe] in the gas and the galaxy gas fraction decrease when moving to higher large-scale densities in the simulation, suggesting that the cores of cosmic environments host, on average, older and more massive galaxies, whose enrichment is affected by a larger number of Type Ia Supernova events.</description>

      <title>GHOST Commissioning Science Results III: Characterizing an iron-poor damped Lyman $\alpha$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) is a new echelle spectrograph available on the Gemini-South telescope as of Semester 2024A. We present the first high resolution spectrum of the quasar J1449-1227 (redshift z_em=3.27) using data taken during the commissioning of GHOST. The observed quasar hosts an intervening iron-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.5) damped Lyman alpha (DLA) system at redshift z=2.904. Taking advantage of the high spectral resolving power of GHOST (R~55000), we are able to accurately model the metal absorption lines of the metal-poor DLA and find a supersolar [Si/Fe], suggesting the DLA gas is in an early stage of chemical enrichment. Using simple ionization models, we find that the large range in the C IV/Si IV column density ratio of individual components within the DLA's high ionization absorption profile can be reproduced by several metal-poor Lyman limit systems surrounding the low-ionization gas of the DLA. It is possible that this metal-poor DLA resides within a complex system of metal-poor galaxies or filaments with inflowing gas. The high spectral resolution, wavelength coverage and sensitivity of GHOST makes it an ideal spectrograph for characterizing the chemistry and kinematics of quasar absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Rings: Polar Ring Galaxy NGC 4262 and its Globular Cluster System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the hierarchical model of galaxy evolution, polar ring galaxies (PRGs) are considered the intermediate phase between ongoing mergers and quiescent galaxies. This study explores the globular cluster system (GCS) and its properties in the nearest PRG, NGC4262, serving as a pilot investigation to study GCS in nearby PRGs. We utilize wide and deep field observations of the CFHT as part of the NGVS to investigate the GCS of NGC4262. We presented the first optical image of NGC4262 with an optically faint ring component. The photometric analysis of the GCS displays a distinct color bimodality. We estimate the total number of GCs for NGC4262 to be 266$\pm$16 GCs with a specific frequency of 4.2$\pm$0.8 and a specific mass of 0.23$\pm$0.01, which is relatively high compared to other galaxies of similar mass and environmental conditions. The spatial and azimuthal distributions of subpopulations reveal strong evidence of previous interactions within the host galaxy. The color distribution of GCS in NGC4262 shows a gradient of -0.05$\pm$0.01 within 5.5\arcmin, supporting the notion of past interactions and evolutionary transitions. PRG NGC4262 conforms to the overall trend of the GCS mass with respect to the halo mass. Furthermore, our investigation of the global scaling relations between GCS and host galaxy parameters provides further support for the hypothesis that PRGs are an intermediate phase connecting ongoing mergers and quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>The outflowing ionised gas of I Zw 1 observed by HST COS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the HST COS spectrum of IZw1 aiming to probe the absorbing medium associated with the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We fitted the emission spectrum and performed spectral analysis of the identified absorption features to derive the corresponding ionic column densities and covering fractions of the associated outflows. We employed photoionisation modelling to constrain the total column density and the ionisation parameter of four detected kinematic components. By investigating the implications of the results together with the observed kinematic properties of both emission and absorption features, we derived constraints on the structure and geometry of the absorbing medium in the AGN environment. We find and characterise absorption line systems from outflowing ionised gas in four distinct kinematic components, located at -60, -280, -1950, and -2900 km/s with respect to the source rest frame. While the two slower outflows are consistent with a full covering of the underlying radiation source, the well-constrained doublet line ratios of the faster two, higher column density, outflows suggest partial covering, with a covering fraction of C_f~0.4. The faster outflows show also line-locking in the NV doublet, a signature of acceleration via line absorption. This makes IZw1 possibly the closest object that shows evidence for hosting line-driven winds. The observed -1950 km/s absorption is likely due to the same gas as an X-ray warm absorber. Furthermore, the behaviour in UV and X-ray bands implies that this outflow has a clumpy structure. We find that the highly asymmetric broad emission lines in IZw1, indicative of a collimated, outflowing broad line region, are covered by the absorbing gas. Finally, the strongest UV--X-ray absorber may be connected to some of the blueshifted line emission, indicative of a more spatially extended structure of this ionised medium.</description>

      <title>The Rise of the $R$-Process in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) produce copious amounts of heavy r-process elements after a time delayed inspiral process. Once NSMs are present in a galaxy, r-process elements, such as Eu, are expected to significantly increase with time. Yet, there has been limited observational data in support of Eu increasing within Local Group galaxies. We have obtained high-resolution Magellan/MIKE observations of 43 metal-poor stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus tidally disrupted galaxy with $-2.5 &lt; \rm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -1$. For the first time, we find a clear rise in [Eu/Mg] with increasing [Mg/H] within one galaxy. We use a chemical evolution model to study how such a rise can result from the interplay of prompt and delayed r-process enrichment events. Delayed r-process sources are required to explain the rise and subsequent leveling off of [Eu/Mg] in this disrupted galaxy. However, the rise may be explained by delayed r-process sources with either short ($\sim 10$ Myr) or long ($\sim 500$ Myr) minimum delay times. Future studies on the nature of r-process sources and their enrichment processes in the GSE will require additional stars in the GSE at even lower metallicities than the present study.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotonic Relations of Galaxy Star Formation, Radius, and Structure at Fixed Stellar Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between galaxy structure and star formation rate (SFR) in a sample of $\sim2.9\times10^{4}$ central galaxies with $z&lt;0.0674$ and axial ratios $b/a&gt;0.5$. The star-forming main sequence (SFMS) shows a bend around the stellar mass of $M_\ast\leq{}M_c=2\times10^{10}{}M_{\odot}$. At $M_\ast\leq{}M_c$ the SFMS follows a power-law $\text{SFR}\propto{}M_\ast^{0.85}$, while at higher masses it flattens. $M_c$ corresponds to a dark matter halo mass of $M_\text{vir}\sim{}10^{11.8}M_{\odot}$ where virial shocks occurs. Some galaxy structure (e.g., half-light radius, $R_e$) exhibits a non-monotonic dependence across the SFMS at a fixed $M_\ast$. We find $\text{SFR}\propto{R_e^{-0.28}}$ at fixed $M_\ast$, consistent with the global Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law. This finding suggests that galaxy sizes contribute to the scatter of the SFMS. However, at $M_\ast&gt;M_c$ the relationship between SFR and $R_e$ diminishes. Low-mass galaxies above the mean of the SFMS have smaller radii, exhibit compact and centrally concentrated profiles resembling green valley (GV) and quiescent galaxies at the same mass, and have higher $M_{\text{H}_2}/M_\text{HI}$. Conversely, those below the SFMS exhibit larger radii, lower densities, have no GV or quiescent counterparts at their mass and have lower $M_{\text{H}_2}/M_\text{HI}$. The above data suggest two pathways for quenching low-mass galaxies, $M_\ast\leq{}M_c$: a fast one that changes the morphology on the SFMS and a slow one that does not. Above $M_c$, galaxies below the SFMS resemble GV and quiescent galaxies structurally, implying that they undergo a structural transformation already within the SFMS. For these massive galaxies, CG are strongly bimodal, with SFMS galaxies exhibiting negative color gradients, suggesting most star formation occurs in their outskirts, maintaining them within the SFMS.</description>

      <title>Four Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei Found From Optical Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the finding of four changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGN). We selected these sources due to their potential as interesting targets when considering their relatively-large optical flux variations and related mid-infrared flux variations. To identify their CL feature, we use archival spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) taken at least 8 years ago as well as spectra taken recently from the Transient Name Server (TNS) and with the 2.4-m LiJiang telescope (LJT). We study the sources' spectral changes by fitting and determining the H$_\alpha$ and H$_\beta$ components and verify their CL behavior. When comparing the TNS and/or LJT spectra to the SDSS ones, all four sources showed the appearance of a broad or a stronger broad H$_\alpha$ component and a relatively weak broad H$_\beta$ component. As two of the four sources are established to have a brighter-and-bluer feature in the photometric data, during the time periods in which the TNS and LJT spectra were taken, this feature likely accompanied the turn-on of the broad components. Thus, we suggest that this brighter-and-bluer feature can be used as a criterion for efficiently finding CL sources among previously spectroscopically classified type 2 AGN, such as from among the sources provided by the SDSS.</description>

      <title>Quasars with Flare/Eclipse-like Variability Identified in ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit optical/UV variability and most of them can be well modeled by the damped random walks. Physical processes that are not related to the accretion disk, such as tidal disruption events (TDE) or moving foreground dusty clouds, can cause flare-like and eclipse-like features in the optical light curve. Both long-term and high-cadence monitoring are needed to identify such features. By combining the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Panoramic Survey Telescope, and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, we are able to identify a rare sample (11) out of the SDSS quasar catalog (around 83, 000). These quasars exhibit more or less constant brightness but show rapid optical variation in the ZTF DR2 epochs. To investigate the possible origins of these flare/eclipse-like variabilities, we propose the second epoch spectroscopic observations with the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC). We find that the change in accretion rate plays a significant role in these quasar variabilities. Among them, we identify two Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL-AGN) candidates: SDSS J1427+2930 and SDSS J1420+3757. The luminosity change of the former may be caused by the enhanced SMBH accretion or the tidal disruption event, while the latter is more related to the change in the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity of the magnetic field at different scales: the case of G31.41+0.31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Dust polarization observations of the massive protocluster G31.41+0.31 carried out at ~1'' (~3750 au) resolution with the SMA at 870 microm have revealed one of the clearest examples to date of an hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology in the high-massregime. Additionally, ~0.24'' (~900 au) resolution observations with ALMA at 1.3 mm have confirmed these results. The next step is to investigate whether the magnetic field maintains its hourglass-shaped morphology down to circumstellar scales. Aims. To study the magnetic field morphology toward the four (proto)stars A, B, C, and D contained in G31.41+0.31 and examine whether the self-similarity observed at core scales (1'' and 0.24'' resolution) still holds at circumstellar scales, we carried out ALMA observations of the polarized dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3.1 mm at an angular resolution of ~0.068'' (~250 au), sufficient to resolve the envelope emission of the embedded protostars. Methods. We used ALMA to perform full polarization observations at 233 GHz (Band 6) and 97.5 GHz (Band 3) with a synthesized beam of 0.072'' x 0.064''. We carried out polarization observations at two different wavelengths to confirm that the polarization traces magnetically aligned dust grains and is not due to dust self-scattering. Results. The polarized emission and the direction of the magnetic field obtained at the two wavelengths are basically the same, except for an area between the embedded sources C and B. In such an area, the emission at 1.3 mm could be optically thick and affected by dichroic extinction. ...</description>

      <title>The evolutionary pathways of disk galaxies with different sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the IllustrisTNG-50 simulation, a sample of 836 central disk galaxies with tiny stellar halos is chosen to study the inherent evolution of galaxies driven by nature. These galaxies are classified as compact, normal, or extended by referencing their locations on the mass-size ($M_\star-R_{\rm 1/2}$) diagram. This research demonstrates the distinctive evolutionary pathways of galaxies with different sizes in IllustrisTNG simulations, primarily driven by nature. It is confirmed that disk galaxies inherit the angular momentum of their parent dark matter halos. More compact galaxies form earlier within halos possessing lower specific angular momentum through heightened star formation during the early phase at redshifts above 2. During the later phase, the size of extended galaxies experiences more pronounced growth by accreting gas with high angular momentum. Additionally, we reveal that many key characteristics of galaxies are linked to their mass and size: (1) compact galaxies tend to exhibit higher metal content, proportional to the potential well $\frac{M_\star}{R_{\rm 1/2}}$, (2) compact galaxies host more massive bulges and black holes, and higher central concentration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that galaxies of all types continue to actively engage in star formation, with no evident signs of quenching attributed to their varying sizes and angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Membership determination in open clusters using the DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the machine learning clustering algorithm Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to study the membership of stars in twelve open clusters (NGC~2264, NGC~2682, NGC~2244, NGC~3293, NGC~6913, NGC~7142, IC~1805, NGC~6231, NGC~2243, NGC 6451, NGC 6005 and NGC 6583) based on Gaia DR3 Data. This sample of clusters spans a variety of parameters like age, metallicity, distance, extinction and a wide parameter space in proper motions and parallaxes. We obtain reliable cluster members using DBSCAN as faint as $G \sim 20$ mag and also in the outer regions of clusters. With our revised membership list, we plot color-magnitude diagrams and we obtain cluster parameters for our sample using ASteCA and compare it with the catalog values. We also validate our membership sample by spectroscopic data from APOGEE and GALAH for the available data. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DBSCAN in membership determination of clusters.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a dormant 33 solar-mass black hole in pre-release Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from black-hole merging events have revealed a population of extra-galactic BHs residing in short-period binaries with masses that are higher than expected based on most stellar evolution models - and also higher than known stellar-origin black holes in our Galaxy. It has been proposed that those high-mass BHs are the remnants of massive metal-poor stars. Gaia astrometry is expected to uncover many Galactic wide-binary systems containing dormant BHs, which may not have been detected before. The study of this population will provide new information on the BH-mass distribution in binaries and shed light on their formation mechanisms and progenitors. As part of the validation efforts in preparation for the fourth Gaia data release (DR4), we analysed the preliminary astrometric binary solutions, obtained by the Gaia Non-Single Star pipeline, to verify their significance and to minimise false-detection rates in high-mass-function orbital solutions. The astrometric binary solution of one source, Gaia BH3, implies the presence of a 32.70 \pm 0.82 M\odot BH in a binary system with a period of 11.6 yr. Gaia radial velocities independently validate the astrometric orbit. Broad-band photometric and spectroscopic data show that the visible component is an old, very metal-poor giant of the Galactic halo, at a distance of 590 pc. The BH in the Gaia BH3 system is more massive than any other Galactic stellar-origin BH known thus far. The low metallicity of the star companion supports the scenario that metal-poor massive stars are progenitors of the high-mass BHs detected by gravitational-wave telescopes. The Galactic orbit of the system and its metallicity indicate that it might belong to the Sequoia halo substructure. Alternatively, and more plausibly, it could belong to the ED-2 stream, which likely originated from a globular cluster that had been disrupted by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Stellar angular momentum of intermediate redshift galaxies in MUSE surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the stellar rotation of galaxies by computing the $\lambda_{R}$ parameter, a proxy for the stellar angular momentum in a sample of 106 galaxies with redshift 0.1 $&lt;$ z $&lt;$ 0.8 and stellar masses from $\sim$10$^{7.5}$ to 10$^{11.8}$ M$_{\odot}$. The sample is located in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and COSMOS fields, and it was observed by various MUSE surveys. We create stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps using a full-spectrum fitting technique, covering spatially $\sim$2$R_{e}$ for the galaxies. We study the impact of the atmospheric seeing on the spin parameter and apply corrections when pertinent. Through the analysis of the $\lambda_{R}-\epsilon$ diagram, we notice that the fraction of round and massive galaxies increases with redshift. We lack galaxies with $\lambda_{R}$ &lt; 0.1 in the sample and we find only one potential, but uncertain, low-mass slow rotator at z $\sim0.3$. Moreover, we do not see an evident evolution or trend in the stellar angular momentum with redshift. We characterize the sample environment using two indicators: a local estimator based on the Voronoi tesselation method, and a global estimator derived by the use of the Friends-of-Friends algorithm. We find no correlation between the environment and $\lambda_{R}$ given that we are not probing dense regions or massive galaxy structures. We also analyze the kinematic maps of the sample finding that about 40$\%$ of galaxies are consistent with being regular rotators, having rotating stellar discs with flat velocity dispersion maps, while $\sim20\%$ of galaxies have complex velocity maps and can be identified as non-regular rotators in spite of their $\lambda_{R}$ values. For the remaining galaxies the classification is uncertain. As we lack galaxies with $\lambda_{R}$&lt; 0.1, we are not able to identify when galaxies become slow rotators within the surveyed environments, area and redshift range.</description>

      <title>Impacts of stellar wind and supernovae on the star cluster formation: origins of extremely high N/O ratios and multiple stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study metal enrichment originating from stellar wind and supernovae in low-metallicity clouds by performing three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that metals ejected from stellar wind are accumulated, leading to subsequent star formation in the nitrogen-enriched gas. During this early phase, the N/O ratios are similar to observed nitrogen-enriched galaxies (${\rm [N/O]}\gtrsim0.5$). Then, once supernovae occur, the N/O ratios decrease significantly. If the duration of star formation is comparable to the timescale of SNe, the mass fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars reaches half the mass of star clusters. We suggest that the mass of the star cluster needs to exceed $\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$ to have multiple populations due to stellar wind, considering the condition for massive star cluster formation and the timescales of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Tracing the evolutionary pathways of dust and cold gas in high-z quiescent galaxies with SIMBA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of copious amounts of dust in quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 1-2$) challenge the conventional view that these objects have poor interstellar medium (ISM) in proportion to their stellar mass. We use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to explore the evolution of dust and cold gas content in QGs in relation to the quenching processes affecting them. We track the changes in the ISM dust abundance across the evolutionary history of QGs identified at $0 \lesssim z \lesssim2$ in the field and cluster environments. The QGs quench via diverse pathways, both rapid and slow, and exhibit a wide range of times elapsed between the quenching event and cold gas removal (from $\sim650$ Myr to $\sim8$ Gyr). We find that quenching modes attributed to the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) do not affect dust and cold gas within the same timescales. Remarkably, QGs may replenish their dust content in the quenched phase primarily due to internal processes and marginally by external factors such as minor mergers. The key mechanism for re-formation of dust is prolonged grain growth on gas-phase metals, it is effective within $\sim100$ Myr after the quenching event, and rapidly increases the dust-to-gas mass ratio in QGs above the standard values ($\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$). As a result, despite heavily depleted cold gas reservoirs, roughly half of QGs maintain little evolution in their ISM dust with stellar age within the first 2 Gyr following the quenching. Overall, we predict that relatively dusty QGs ($M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}\gtrsim10^{-3}-10^{-4}$) arise from both fast and slow quenchers, and are prevalent in systems of intermediate and low stellar masses ($9&lt;\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&lt;10.5$). This prediction poses an immediate quest for observational synergy between e.g., James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).</description>

      <title>PEARLS: Discovery of Point-Source Features Within Galaxies in the North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $ $The first public 0.9-4.4 $\mu$m NIRCam images of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) uncovered many galaxies that display point-source features in their cores as seen in the longer wavelength filters. We visually identified a sample of 66 galaxies ($\sim$1 galaxy per arcmin$^2$) with point-like cores and fit their spectral energy distributions (SED)s using EAZY and CIGALE to characterize the sample's active galactic nucleus (AGN) and host galaxy parameters. Single-template fitting best fits $70\%$ of the sample with a Seyfert-blended SED. With CIGALE we compute the median fractional AGN contribution to the 0.1-30.0 $\mu$m flux to be $0.30\pm0.06$, and that $56\%$ of the 66 galaxies have star-formation rates in the starburst range whereas the remainder are near the star-formation main sequence. There are Very Large Array (VLA) 3 GHz detections for 24/66 galaxies, implying some combination of AGN emission and vigorous star formation. We present a novel sample selection procedure in tandem to the morphological sample selection based on objects' light profiles at 4.4 $\mu$m. This procedure identifies a parameter space which probes point-source features and automatically recovers our visual sample with minimal contamination from both stars and brighter galaxies. This procedure may be used in other extant and future NIRCam images to streamline the search for galaxies with point-like cores. The morphological approach to recognizing AGN is being resurrected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) by virtue of its superb angular resolution at infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Pop~III stars' chemical signature in neutral gas at $z\sim6$. A study based on the E-XQR-30 spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the metal enrichment signatures attributed to the first generation of stars (PopIII) in the Universe, focusing on the E-XQR-30 sample. We aim to identify traces of Pop III metal enrichment by analyzing neutral gas in the interstellar medium of primordial galaxies and their satellite clumps, detected in absorption. To chase the chemical signature of PopIII stars, we studied metal absorption systems in the E-XQR-30 sample, selected through the detection of the OI absorption line at 1302A. The OI line is a reliable tracer of HI and allowed us to overcome the challenges posed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest's increasing saturation at redshifts above $\sim5$ to identify Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLA). We detected and analyzed 29 OI systems at $z\geq5.4$, differentiating between proximate DLAs (PDLA) and intervening DLAs. Voigt function fits were applied to obtain ionic column densities, and relative chemical abundances were determined for 28 systems. These were then compared with the predictions of theoretical models. Our findings expand the study of OI systems at $z\geq5.4$ fourfold. No systematic differences were observed in the average chemical abundances between PDLAs and intervening DLAs. The chemical abundances in our sample align with literature systems at $z&gt;4.5$, suggesting a similar enrichment pattern for this class of absorption systems. A comparison between these DLA-analogues at $4.5&lt;z&lt;6.5$ with a sample of very metal-poor DLAs at $2&lt;z&lt;4.5$ shows in general similar average values for the relative abundances, with the exception of [C/O], [Si/Fe] and [Si/O] which are significantly larger for the high-$z$ sample. Furthermore, the dispersion of the measurements significantly increases in the high-redshift bin. This increase is predicted by the theoretical models and indicates a potential retention of PopIII signatures in the probed gas. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Maser Flares Driven by Isothermal Shock Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use 3D computer modelling to investigate the timescales and radiative output from maser flares generated by the impact of shock-waves on astronomical unit-scale clouds in interstellar and star-forming regions, and in circumstellar regions in some circumstances. Physical conditions are derived from simple models of isothermal hydrodynamic (single-fluid) and C-type (ionic and neutral fluid) shock-waves, and based on the ortho-H$_2$O 22-GHz transition. Maser saturation is comprehensively included, and we find that the most saturated maser inversions are found predominantly in the shocked material. We study the effect on the intensity, flux density and duration of flares of the following parameters: the pre-shock level of saturation, the observer's viewpoint, and the shock speed. Our models are able to reproduce observed flare rise times of a few times 10 days, specific intensities of up to 10$^5$ times the saturation intensity and flux densities of order $100(R/d)^2$Jy from a source of radius $R$ astronomical units at a distance of $d$ kiloparsec. We found that flares from C-type shocks are approximately 5 times more likely to be seen by a randomly placed observer than flares from hydrodynamically shocked clouds of similar dimensions. We computed intrinsic beaming patterns of the maser emission, finding substantial extension of the pattern parallel to the shock front in the hydrodynamic models. Beaming solid angles for hydrodynamic models can be as small as $1.3\times 10^{-5}$sr, but are an order of magnitude larger for C-type models.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS III: Unbiased UV continuum slopes at 6.5&lt;z&lt;13 from combined PEARLS GTO and public JWST NIRCam imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of rest-frame UV continuum slopes, $\beta$, using a sample of 1011 galaxies at $6.5&lt;z&lt;13$ from the EPOCHS photometric sample collated from the GTO PEARLS and public ERS/GTO/GO (JADES, CEERS, NGDEEP, GLASS) JWST NIRCam imaging across $178.9~\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ of unmasked blank sky. We correct our UV slopes for the photometric error coupling bias using $200,000$ power law SEDs for each $\beta=\{-1,-1.5,-2,-2.5,-3\}$ in each field, finding biases as large as $\Delta\beta\simeq-0.55$ for the lowest SNR galaxies in our sample. Additionally, we simulate the impact of rest-UV line emission (including Ly$\alpha$) and damped Ly$\alpha$ systems on our measured $\beta$, finding biases as large as $0.5-0.6$ for the most extreme systems. We find a decreasing trend with redshift of $\beta=-1.51\pm0.08-(0.097\pm0.010)\times z$, with potential evidence for Pop.~III stars or top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in a subsample of 68 $\beta+\sigma_{\beta}&lt;-2.8$ galaxies. At $z\simeq11.5$, we measure an extremely blue $\beta(M_{\mathrm{UV}}=-19)=-2.73\pm0.06$, deviating from simulations, indicative of low-metallicity galaxies with non-zero Lyman continuum escape fractions $f_{\mathrm{esc, LyC}}\gtrsim0$ and minimal dust content. The observed steepening of $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\log_{10}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ from $0.22\pm0.02$ at $z=7$ to $0.81\pm0.13$ at $z=11.5$ implies that dust produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) at early times may be ejected via outflows from low mass galaxies. We also observe a flatter $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}M_{\mathrm{UV}}=0.03\pm0.02$ at $z=7$ and a shallower $\mathrm{d}\beta/\mathrm{d}\log_{10}(M_{\star} / \mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ at $z&lt;11$ than seen by HST, unveiling a new population of low mass, faint, galaxies reddened by dust produced in the stellar winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries.</description>

      <title>A Young Super Star Cluster Powering a Nebula of Retained Massive Star Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest that "Godzilla", an intriguing source in the lensed Sunburst galaxy at $z=2.37$, is a young super star cluster powering a compact nebula within gravitationally trapped stellar ejecta. Employing HST photometry and spectroscopy from MUSE and X-Shooter at VLT, we infer physical and chemical properties of the cluster and nebula, finding Godzilla is young (4-6 Myr), massive ($\sim 10^{6-7}M_\odot$), a stellar metallicity $Z \simeq 0.25Z_\odot$, and has the FUV component more compact than a few pc. The nebula gas is significantly enriched with N and He, indicating stellar wind material, and has highly elevated O relative to the sub-solar stellar metallicity, which indicates entrainment of CCSNe ejecta. The high gas density $n_{\rm e} \simeq 10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ implies a highly pressurized intracluster environment. We propose the high pressure is due to CCSN-driven supersonic turbulence in warm, self-shielding gas, which has accumulated in the cluster center after runaway radiative cooling and is dense enough to resist removal by CCSNe. The nebula gas shows sub-solar C/O, Ne/O and Si/O values, which may reflect the CCSN element yields for initial stellar masses $&gt;40M_\odot$. A comparison to element yield synthesis models for young star clusters shows that the gas abundance pattern is consistent with complete retention and mixture of stellar winds and CCSNe ejecta until the inferred cluster age. The O and He enhancement we find may have implications for the formation of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, as Godzilla likely has already formed second-generation stars prior to the onset of CCSNe and evolved star winds, in order not to contradict the non-observation of O and large He enhancement in second-generation stars.</description>

      <title>H-alpha emission and HII regions at the locations of recent supernovae in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the local, approximately 50-100 pc scale, H-alpha emission at the locations of recent (less than 125 years) supernovae (SNe) in nearby star-forming galaxies. Our sample consists of 32 SNe in 10 galaxies that are targets of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We find that 41% (13/32) of these SNe occur coincident with a previously identified HII region. For comparison, HII regions cover 32% of the area within 1 kpc of any recent SN. Contrasting this local covering fraction with the fraction of SNe coincident with HII regions, we find a statistical excess of 7.6% +/- 8.7% of all SNe to be associated with HII regions. This increases to an excess of 19.2% +/- 10.4% when considering only core-collapse SNe. These estimates appear to be in good agreement with qualitative results from new, higher resolution HST H-alpha imaging, which also suggest many CCSNe detonate near but not in HII regions. Our results appear consistent with the expectation that only a modest fraction of stars explode during the first 5 Myr of the life of a stellar population, when H-alpha emission is expected to be bright. Of the HII region associated SNe, 8% (11/13) also have associated detected CO(2-1) emission, indicating the presence of molecular gas. The HII region associated SNe have typical Av extinctions approximately equal to 1 mag, consistent with a significant amount of pre-clearing of gas from the region before the SNe explode.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Gems Arc at $z\sim10.2$ with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent JWST NIRCam imaging observations of SPT0615-JD (also known as the Cosmic Gems Arc), lensed by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. The 5-arcsec-long arc is the most highly magnified $z&gt;10$ galaxy known, straddling the lensing critical curve and revealing five star clusters with radii $\sim 1$ pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a magnification $\mu \sim 60$ (delensed 29.7 AB mag, $M_{UV} = -17.8$). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W$-$F200W $&gt;3.2$ mag ($2\sigma$ lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters ($&lt; 2\sigma$), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break ($\beta = -2.7 \pm 0.1$), resulting in a photometric redshift $z_{phot} = 10.2 \pm 0.2$ (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below $z &lt; 9.8$. Based on SED fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of $M_{*} \sim 2.4 - 5.6 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, young mass-weighted age of $\sim 21 - 79$ Myr, low dust content ($A_V &lt; 0.15$), and a low metallicity of $\lesssim 1\%~Z_{\odot}$. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by $\mu \sim 2$, suggesting the fold arc may only show $\sim60$% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Searching for cold gas traced by MgII quasar absorbers in massive X-ray-selected galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost 50% of galaxies in the local Universe are in clusters or groups coexisting with both hot and cold gas components. In the present study, we observationally probed the cold-gas content of X-ray-selected massive galaxy clusters with spectroscopic redshift measured from the SDSS/SPIDERS survey. This paper focuses on the most massive structures: galaxy clusters with a mean mass of M$_{500c}$ = 2.7$\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. We used a large number of background quasar optical spectra from SDSS DR16 to probe the diffuse T$=$10$^4$K gas in their intracluster medium. We first analysed a sample of spectra with known MgII absorbers, and then blindly stacked about 16,000 archival spectra at the redshifts of the foreground galaxy clusters. We tentatively ($3.7 \sigma$ significance) detect MgII in the clusters with an equivalent width EW(MgII $\lambda$2796) of 0.056$\pm$0.015 \r{A}, corresponding to a column density of log [N(MgII)/cm$^{-2}$]=12.12$\pm0.1$. We tested our methodology by generating 22,000 mock SDSS spectra with MgII absorbers from Illustris-TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, combining photo-ionisation modelling and ray tracing. We also performed bootstrapping stacking at different cluster redshifts and stacked quasar spectra with no intervening clusters in the line of sight to measure the significance of our detection. These results are in line with the findings of recent, similar observational studies but challenge predictions from Illustris-TNG simulations. Together, our findings indicate that large amounts of cold gas may be found in the most massive structures of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Can AI Understand Our Universe? Test of Fine-Tuning GPT by Astrophysical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been the most talked-about concept in recent months, captivating both professionals and the general public alike, and has sparked discussions about the changes that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring to the world. As physicists and astrophysicists, we are curious about if scientific data can be correctly analyzed by large language models (LLMs) and yield accurate physics. In this article, we fine-tune the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model by the astronomical data from the observations of galaxies, quasars, stars, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the simulations of black holes (BHs), the fine-tuned model demonstrates its capability to classify astrophysical phenomena, distinguish between two types of GRBs, deduce the redshift of quasars, and estimate BH parameters. We regard this as a successful test, marking the LLM's proven efficacy in scientific research. With the ever-growing volume of multidisciplinary data and the advancement of AI technology, we look forward to the emergence of a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of our universe. This article also shares some interesting thoughts on data collection and AI design. Using the approach of understanding the universe - looking outward at data and inward for fundamental building blocks - as a guideline, we propose a method of series expansion for AI, suggesting ways to train and control AI that is smarter than humans.</description>

      <title>Rotation and flipping invariant self-organizing maps with astronomical images: A cookbook and application to the VLA Sky Survey QuickLook images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wide field radio surveys typically detect millions of objects. Techniques based on machine learning are proving to be useful for classifying large numbers of objects. The self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that projects a many-dimensional dataset onto a two- or three-dimensional lattice of neurons. This dimensionality reduction allows the user to visualize common features of the data better and develop algorithms for classifying objects that are not otherwise possible with large datasets. To this aim, we use the PINK implementation of a SOM. PINK incorporates rotation and flipping invariance so that the SOM algorithm may be applied to astronomical images. In this cookbook we provide instructions for working with PINK, including preprocessing the input images, training the model, and offering lessons learned through experimentation. The problem of imbalanced classes can be improved by careful selection of the training sample and increasing the number of neurons in the SOM (chosen by the user). Because PINK is not scale-invariant, structure can be smeared in the neurons. This can also be improved by increasing the number of neurons in the SOM. We also introduce pyink, a Python package used to read and write PINK binary files, assist in common preprocessing operations, perform standard analyses, visualize the SOM and preprocessed images, and create image-based annotations using a graphical interface. A tutorial is also provided to guide the user through the entire process. We present an application of PINK to VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) images. We demonstrate that the PINK is generally able to group VLASS sources with similar morphology together. We use the results of PINK to estimate the probability that a given source in the VLASS QuickLook Catalogue is actually due to sidelobe contamination.</description>

      <title>Testing the TDE Outflow Model for the Bipolar Sgr A Lobes at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sgr A lobes are a pair of 15-pc-sized bipolar bubbles with co-aligned major axes perpendicular to the Galactic plane found in X-ray and radio observations of the Galactic center (GC). Their elusive origin is a vital ingredient in understanding the ongoing high energy processes at the GC. Here we perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to explore the tidal disruption event (TDE) outflow model for the origin of the Sgr A lobes. By following the outflow evolution in the circumnuclear medium, we find that TDE outflows naturally produce bipolar lobes delimited by forward shocks, and the dense postshock shell contributes significantly to the lobe's X-ray emission. Our fiducial run reproduces the morphology, density, temperature, and X-ray surface brightness distribution of the observed Sgr A lobes reasonably well. The current lobe age is ~3300 yr. Our model further predicts that the uplifted wake flow breaks through the ejecta-induced shock front, producing a shock-enclosed head region which is relatively dim in X-rays compared to other lobe regions. Both the dim head region and the predicted limb-brightening feature of the lobes are slightly inconsistent with current X-ray observations, and may be used to further test our model with more sensitive future X-ray observations. While light narrow jets and massive wide winds from TDE events usually do not reproduce the observed oval-shaped morphology of the lobes, the TDE outflow in our fiducial run is massive and yet narrow. Whether it is a jet or wind remains uncertain and future simulations covering both the outflow acceleration region and its pc-scale evolution would be very helpful in determining whether the Sgr A lobes indeed originate from a pair of TDE jets or winds.</description>

      <title>Early-time gamma-ray constraints on cosmic-ray acceleration in the core-collapse SN 2023ixf with the Fermi Large Area Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While SNRs have been considered the most relevant Galactic CR accelerators for decades, CCSNe could accelerate particles during the earliest stages of their evolution and hence contribute to the CR energy budget in the Galaxy. Some SNRs have indeed been associated with TeV gamma-rays, yet proton acceleration efficiency during the early stages of an SN expansion remains mostly unconstrained. The multi-wavelength observation of SN 2023ixf, a Type II SN in the nearby galaxy M101, opens the possibility to constrain CR acceleration within a few days after the collapse of the RSG stellar progenitor. With this work, we intend to provide a phenomenological, quasi-model-independent constraint on the CR acceleration efficiency during this event at photon energies above 100 MeV. We performed a maximum-likelihood analysis of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope up to one month after the SN explosion. We searched for high-energy emission from its expanding shock, and estimated the underlying hadronic CR energy reservoir assuming a power-law proton distribution consistent with standard diffusive shock acceleration. We do not find significant gamma-ray emission from SN 2023ixf. Nonetheless, our non-detection provides the first limit on the energy transferred to the population of hadronic CRs during the very early expansion of a CCSN. Under reasonable assumptions, our limits would imply a maximum efficiency on the CR acceleration of as low as 1%, which is inconsistent with the common estimate of 10% in generic SNe. However, this result is highly dependent on the assumed geometry of the circumstellar medium, and could be relaxed back to 10% by challenging spherical symmetry. A more sophisticated, inhomogeneous characterisation of the shock and the progenitor's environment is required before establishing whether or not Type II SNe are indeed efficient CR accelerators at early times.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy sizes correlate closely with the sizes of their parent dark matter haloes, suggesting a link between halo formation and galaxy growth. However, the precise nature of this relation and its scatter remains to be understood fully, especially for low-mass galaxies. We analyse the galaxy-halo size relation for low-mass ($M_\star \sim 10^{7-9} {\rm M_\odot}$) central galaxies over the past 12.5 billion years with the help of cosmological volume simulations (FIREbox) from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We find a nearly linear relationship between the half-stellar mass galaxy size $R_{1/2}$ and the parent dark matter halo virial radius $R_{\rm vir}$. This relation evolves only weakly since redshift $z = 5$: $R_{1/2} {\rm kpc} = (0.053\pm0.002)(R_{\rm vir}/35 {\rm kpc})^{0.934\pm0.054}$, with a nearly constant scatter $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.084 [{\rm dex}]$. Whilst this ratio is similar to what is expected from models where galaxy disc sizes are set by halo angular momentum, the low-mass galaxies in our sample are not angular momentum supported, with stellar rotational to circular velocity ratios $v_{\rm rot} / v_{\rm circ} \sim 0.15$. Introducing redshift as another parameter to the GHSR does not decrease the scatter. Furthermore, this scatter does not correlate with any of the halo properties we investigate -- including spin and concentration -- suggesting that baryonic processes and feedback physics are instead critical in setting the scatter in the galaxy-halo size relation. Given the relatively small scatter and the weak dependence of the galaxy-halo size relation on redshift and halo properties for these low-mass central galaxies, we propose using galaxy sizes as an independent method from stellar masses to infer halo masses.</description>

      <title>Jellyfish galaxies with the IllustrisTNG simulations -- When, where, and for how long does ram pressure stripping of cold gas occur?</title>

Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies are prototypical examples of satellite galaxies undergoing strong ram pressure stripping (RPS). We analyze the evolution of 512 unique, first-infalling jellyfish galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These have been visually inspected to be undergoing RPS sometime in the past 5 billion years~(since~$z=0.5$), have satellite stellar masses~$\mstarsat\sim10^{8-10.5}\,\msun$, and live in hosts with~$\mvir\sim10^{12-14.3}\,\msun$~at~$z=0$. We quantify the cold gas~($T\leq10^{4.5}$~K)~removal using the tracer particles, confirming that for these jellyfish, RPS is the dominant driver of cold gas loss after infall. Half of these jellyfish are completely gas-less by~$z=0$, and these galaxies have earlier infall times and smaller satellite-to-host mass ratios than their gaseous counterparts. RPS can act on jellyfish galaxies over long time scales of~$\approx1.5-8$~Gyr. Jellyfish in more massive hosts are impacted by RPS for a shorter time span and, at a fixed host mass, jellyfish with less cold gas at infall and lower stellar masses at~$z=0$~have shorter RPS time spans. While RPS may act for long periods of time, the peak RPS period -- where at least 50~per~cent of the total RPS occurs -- begins within~$\approx1$~Gyr of infall and lasts~$\lesssim2$~Gyr. During this period, the jellyfish are at host-centric distances~$\sim0.2-2\rvir$, illustrating that much of RPS occurs at large distances from the host galaxy. Interestingly, jellyfish continue forming stars until they have lost $\approx98$~per~cent of their cold gas. For groups and clusters in TNG50~$(\mvirhost\sim10^{13-14.3}\,\msun)$, jellyfish galaxies deposit more cold gas~($\sim10^{11-12}\,\msun$)~into halos than exist in them at~$z=0$, demonstrating that jellyfish, and in general satellite galaxies, are a significant source of cold gas accretion.</description>

      <title>JWST-JADES. Possible Population III signatures at z=10.6 in the halo of GN-z11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00953</link>

Abstract: Finding the first generation of stars formed out of pristine gas in the early Universe, known as Population III (PopIII) stars, is one of the most important goals of modern astrophysics. Recent models have suggested that PopIII stars may form in pockets of pristine gas in the halo of more evolved galaxies. We present NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy and micro-shutter array spectroscopic observations of the region around GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z=10.6, that reveal a greater than 5 sigma detection of a feature consistent with being HeII1640 emission at the redshift of GN-z11. The very high equivalent width of the putative HeII emission in this clump (log(EW_rest(HeII)/A) = 1.79) and a lack of metal lines can be explained in terms of photoionisation by PopIII stars, while photoionisation by PopII stars is inconsistent with the data. The high equivalent width would also indicate that the putative PopIII stars likely have an initial mass function with an upper cutoff reaching at least 500 Msun. The PopIII bolometric luminosity inferred from the HeII line would be 7 x 10^9 Lsun, which would imply a total stellar mass formed in the burst of about 2 x 10^5 Msun. We find that photoionisation by the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in GN-z11 cannot account for the HeII luminosity observed in the clump but can potentially be responsible for an additional HeII emission observed closer to GN-z11. We also consider the possibility of in situ photoionisation by an accreting direct collapse black hole hosted by the HeII clump. We find that this scenario is less favoured, but it remains a possible alternative interpretation. We also report the detection of a Ly-alpha halo stemming out of GN-z11 and extending out to about 2 kpc as well as resolved funnel-shaped CIII emission likely tracing the ionisation cone of the AGN.</description>

      <title>The UNCOVER Survey: A First-look HST+JWST Catalog of Galaxy Redshifts and Stellar Population Properties Spanning $0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent UNCOVER survey with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exploits the nearby cluster Abell 2744 to create the deepest view of our universe to date by leveraging strong gravitational lensing. In this work, we perform photometric fitting of more than 50,000 robustly detected sources out to $z \sim 15$. We show the redshift evolution of stellar ages, star formation rates, and rest-frame colors across the full range of $0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$. The galaxy properties are inferred using the Prospector Bayesian inference framework using informative Prospector-$\beta$ priors on masses and star formation histories to produce joint redshift and stellar population posteriors, and additionally lensing magnification is performed on-the-fly to ensure consistency with the scale-dependent priors. We show that this approach produces excellent photometric redshifts with $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.03$, of a similar quality to the established photometric redshift code EAzY. In line with the open-source scientific objective of the Treasury survey, we publicly release the stellar population catalog with this paper, derived from the photometric catalog adapting aperture sizes based on source profiles. This release includes posterior moments, maximum-likelihood spectra, star-formation histories, and full posterior distributions, offering a rich data set to explore the processes governing galaxy formation and evolution over a parameter space now accessible by JWST.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Drift Map of the Milky Way disk Populations between 8$-$16 kpc with LAMOST and Gaia datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymmetric drift (AD) tomography in different populations is helpful for us to better understand the disk kinematics, dynamics and rotation curves. Using the common stars from the LAMOST and Gaia surveys as well as circular velocity of Gaia DR3, we qualitatively explore the asymmetric drift distributions of the Galactic disk from 8$-$16\,kpc. In the $R-Z$ plane, we find that the asymmetric drift near the mid-plane of the Galactic disk is small and gradually increases with the vertical distance, which makes the asymmetric drift appear as a ``horn'' shape. Meanwhile, we reveal that high [$\alpha$/Fe] populations have larger asymmetric drift than that in the low [$\alpha$/Fe] populations. The asymmetric drift around the solar location V$_a$ = 6 km s$^{-1}$ and the asymmetric drift median value of the whole sample is 16 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we also find that the asymmetric drift median value in the north (20 km s$^{-1}$) of the Galactic disk is larger than that in the south (13 km s$^{-1}$), all errors are within 2 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, when we investigate the asymmetric drift of the Galactic disk in the mono-age stellar populations, it shows that the older stellar populations have larger asymmetric drift and velocity dispersion which are almost consistent with predictions of previous numerical models. Finally, based on the chemistry, we unveil that the median asymmetric drift of the thick disk is much higher than that of the thin disk.</description>

      <title>Comparing emission- and absorption-based gas-phase metallicities in GRB host galaxies at $z=2-4$ using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of what is known of the chemical composition of the universe is based on emission line spectra from star forming galaxies. Emission-based inferences are, nevertheless, model-dependent and they are dominated by light from luminous star forming regions. An alternative and sensitive probe of the metallicity of galaxies is through absorption lines imprinted on the luminous afterglow spectra of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) from neutral material within their host galaxy. We present results from a JWST/NIRSpec programme to investigate for the first time the relation between the metallicity of neutral gas probed in absorption by GRB afterglows and the metallicity of the star forming regions for the same host galaxy sample. Using an initial sample of eight GRB host galaxies at z=2.1-4.7, we find a tight relation between absorption and emission line metallicities when using the recently proposed $\hat{R}$ metallicity diagnostic (+/-0.2dex). This agreement implies a relatively chemically-homogeneous multi-phase interstellar medium, and indicates that absorption and emission line probes can be directly compared. However, the relation is less clear when using other diagnostics, such as R23 and R3. We also find possible evidence of an elevated N/O ratio in the host galaxy of GRB090323 at z=3.58, consistent with what has been seen in other $z&gt;4$ galaxies. Ultimate confirmation of an enhanced N/O ratio and of the relation between absorption and emission line metallicities will require a more direct determination of the emission line metallicity via the detection of temperature-sensitive auroral lines in our GRB host galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic media of massive cluster satellites in the TNG-Cluster simulation: existence and detectability</title>

Abstract: The most massive galaxy clusters in the Universe host hundreds of massive satellite galaxies~$\mstar\sim10^{10-12.5} msun$, but it is unclear if these satellites are able to retain their own gaseous halos. We analyze the evolution of $\approx90,000$ satellites of stellar mass $\sim10^{9-12.5} msun$ around 352 galaxy clusters of mass $\mvir\sim10^{14.3-15.4} msun$ at $z=0$ from the new TNG-Cluster suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations. The number of massive satellites per host increases with host mass, and the mass--richness relation broadly agrees with observations. A halo of mass $\mvirhost\sim10^{14.5} (10^{15}) msun$ hosts $\sim100 (300)$ satellites today. Only a minority of satellites retain some gas, hot or cold, and this fraction increases with stellar mass. Lower-mass satellites $\sim10^{9-10} msun$ are more likely to retain part of their cold interstellar medium, consistent with ram pressure preferentially removing hot extended gas first. At higher stellar masses $\sim10^{10.5-12.5} msun$, the fraction of gas-rich satellites increases to unity, and nearly all satellites retain a portion of their hot, spatially extended circumgalactic medium (CGM), despite the ejective activity of their supermassive black holes. According to TNG-Cluster, the CGM of these gaseous satellites can be seen in soft X-ray emission (0.5-2.0 keV) that is $\gtrsim10$~times brighter than the local background. This X-ray surface brightness excess around satellites extends to $\approx30-100$ kpc, and is strongest for galaxies with higher stellar masses and larger host-centric distances. Approximately $10$~percent of the soft X-ray emission in cluster outskirts $\approx0.75-1.5\rvir$ originates from satellites. The CGM of member galaxies reflects the dynamics of cluster-satellite interactions and contributes to the observationally inferred properties of the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) VIII: Characterising the orbital properties of the ancient, very metal-poor inner Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The oldest stars in the Milky Way (born in the first few billion years) are expected to have a high density in the inner few kpc, spatially overlapping with the Galactic bulge. We use spectroscopic data from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) to study the dynamical properties of ancient, metal-poor inner Galaxy stars. We compute distances using StarHorse, and orbital properties in a barred Galactic potential. With this paper, we release the spectroscopic AAT/PIGS catalogue (13 235 stars). We find that most PIGS stars have orbits typical for a pressure-supported population. The fraction of stars confined to the inner Galaxy decreases with decreasing metallicity, but many very metal-poor stars (VMP, [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0) stay confined (~ 60% stay within 5 kpc). The azimuthal velocity v$_\phi$ also decreases between [Fe/H] = -1.0 and -2.0, but is constant for VMP stars (at ~ 40 km/s). The carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in PIGS appear to have similar orbital properties compared to normal VMP stars. Our results suggest a possible transition between two spheroidal components - a more metal-rich, more concentrated, faster rotating component, and a more metal-poor, more extended and slower/non-rotating component. We propose that the former may be connected to pre-disc in-situ stars (or those born in large building blocks), whereas the latter may be dominated by contributions from smaller galaxies. This is an exciting era where large metal-poor samples, such as in this work (as well as upcoming surveys, e.g., 4MOST), shed light on the earliest evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the latest version of the GAEA model of galaxy formation. Our new model combines (i) an updated treatment of AGN feedback including an improved modelling of cold gas accretion on super-massive BHs and an explicit implementation of quasar winds; and (ii) an improved modelling of cold and hot gas stripping from satellite galaxies. We show that our latest model predicts specific SFR distributions that are in remarkable agreement with observational measurements in the local Universe. Our updated model predicts quenched fractions that are in very nice agreement with data up to z~3-4, and a turn-over of the number densities of quenched galaxies at low stellar masses that is in qualitative agreement with current observational estimates. We show that the main reasons for the improved behaviour with respect to previous renditions of our model are the updated treatment for satellites at low galaxy masses (&lt;10^10 Msun) and the inclusion of quasar winds at intermediate to large stellar masses (&gt;10^10 Msun). However, we show that the better treatment of the star formation threshold, due to our explicit partitioning of the cold gas in its atomic and molecular components, also plays an important role in suppressing excessive residual star formation in massive galaxies. While our analysis is based on a selection of quiescent galaxies that takes advantage of the information about their SFR, we demonstrate that the impact of a different (colour-colour) selection is not significant, at least for galaxies above the completeness limits of current surveys. Our new model predicts number densities of massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;3 that are the largest among recently published models. Yet, our model predictions appear still to be below post-JWST observational measurements. We show that the expected cosmic variance is large, and can easily accommodate some of the most recent measurements.</description>

      <title>Dark no more: The low luminosity stellar counterpart of a dark cloud in the Virgo cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered the stellar counterpart to the ALFALFA Virgo 7 cloud complex, which has been thought to be optically dark and nearly star-free since its discovery in 2007. This ~190 kpc long chain of enormous atomic gas clouds ($M_\mathrm{HI} \sim 10^9 \; \mathrm{M_\odot}$) is embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo galaxy cluster but is isolated from any galaxy. Its faint, blue stellar counterpart, BC6, was identified in a visual search of archival optical and UV imaging. Follow-up observations with the Green Bank Telescope, Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and Hubble Space Telescope demonstrate that this faint counterpart is at the same velocity as the atomic gas, is actively forming stars, and is metal-rich ($12 + \mathrm{(O/H)} = 8.58 \pm 0.25$). We estimate its stellar mass to be only $\log ( M_\ast/\mathrm{M_\odot}) \sim 4.4$, making it one of the most gas-rich stellar systems known. Aside from its extraordinary gas content, the properties of BC6 are entirely consistent with those of a recently identified class of young, low-mass, isolated, and star-forming clouds in Virgo, that appear to have formed via extreme ram pressure stripping events. We expand the existing discussion of the origin of this structure and suggest NGC 4522 as a likely candidate, however, the current evidence is not fully consistent with any of our proposed progenitor galaxies. We anticipate that other "dark" gas clouds in Virgo may have similarly faint, star-forming counterparts. We aim to identify these through the help of a citizen science search of the entire cluster.</description>

      <title>The GUAPOS project. V: The chemical ingredients of a massive stellar protocluster in the making</title>

Abstract: Most stars, including the Sun, are born in rich stellar clusters containing massive stars. Therefore, the study of the chemical reservoir of massive star-forming regions is crucial to understand the basic chemical ingredients available at the dawn of planetary systems. We present a detailed study of the molecular inventory of the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 from the project GUAPOS (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We analyze 34 species for the first time plus 20 species analyzed in previous GUAPOS works, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and chlorine species. We compare the abundances derived in G31.41+0.31 with those observed in other chemically-rich sources that represent the initial and last stages of the formation of stars and planets: the hot corino in the Solar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422 B, and the comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 46P/Wirtanen. The comparative analysis reveals that the chemical feedstock of the two star-forming regions are similar. The abundances of oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing molecules exhibit a good correlation for all pair of sources, including the two comets, suggesting a chemical heritage of these species during the process of star formation, and hence an early phase formation of the molecules. However, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing species present worse correlations, being more abundant in comets. This suggests that while sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing species are predominantly trapped on the surface of icy grains in the hot close surroundings of protostars, they could be more easily released into gas phase in comets, allowing their cosmic abundances to be almost recovered.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of strong 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 Balmer and Paschen lines emitters observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultraviolet continuum traces young stars while the near-infrared unveils older stellar populations and dust-obscured regions. Balmer emission lines provide insights on gas properties and young stellar objects but are highly affected by dust attenuation. The near-infrared Paschen lines suffer less dust attenuation and can be used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) in star-forming regions obscured by dust clouds. We select 13 sources between redshifts 1 and 3 observed with HST, JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec based on the availability of at least one Balmer and one Paschen line with S/N &gt; 5. With a newly-developed version of CIGALE, we fit their hydrogen line equivalent widths (EWs) and photometric data. We assess the impacts of the removal of spectroscopic data by comparing the quality of the fits of the spectro-photometric data to those with photometric data only. We compare the single (BC03) vs binary (BPASS) stellar populations models in the fitting process of spectro-photometric data. We derive the differential attenuation and explore different attenuation recipes by fitting spectro-photometric data with BC03. For each stellar model and for each input dataset (with and without EWs), we quantify the deviation on the SFRs and stellar masses from the "standard" choice. On average, the SFRs are overestimated and the stellar masses are underestimated when EWs are not included as input data. We find a major contribution of the H${\alpha}$ emission line to the broadband photometric measurements of our sources, and a trend of increasing contribution with specific SFR. Using the BPASS models has a significant impact on the derived SFRs and stellar masses. We show that a flexible attenuation recipe provides more accurate estimates of the dust attenuation parameters, especially the differential attenuation which agrees with the original value of Charlot &amp; Fall (2000).</description>

      <title>Image of a black hole illuminated by a parabolic screen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical model of a parabolic screen illuminating a black hole is proposed. This allows to avoid naturally the appearance of edge effects associated with photons moving along the plane of the screen. The temperature distribution along the radius of the screen corresponds to that for a relativistic disk (Novikov-Thorne disk). It is shown that the structure of the emerging black hole shadow differs significantly from the case when the photon source is a remote screen, since in the model considered, the photons subjected to strong gravitational lensing of the black hole are emitted by the "back side" of the screen, which would not be visible in the absence of a black hole. In the thin screen approximation, the shadow of a Schwarzschild black hole has been constructed in cases when the angle between the axis of symmetry of the illuminating screen and the direction towards the observer is 5, 30, 60, and 80 degrees. For the Kerr black hole, images are shown for angles of 60 and 80 degrees.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few to ten hours from nearby galactic nuclei. The origin of QPEs is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk model, where the disk is formed from a previous tidal disruption event (TDE). In this EMRI+TDE disk model, the QPEs are the result of collisions between a TDE disk and a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) orbiting around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of EMRIs which are one of the primary targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. Taking GSN 069 as an example, we find the EMRI wherein is of low eccentricity ($e&lt;0.1$ at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level) and semi-major axis about $O(10^2)$ gravitational radii of the central SMBH, which is consistent with the prediction of the wet EMRI formation channel, while incompatible with alternatives.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from SN 1181 hosting a white dwarf merger product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remnant of the historical supernova 1181 is claimed to be associated with a white dwarf merger remnant J005311. The supernova remnant (SNR) shock, and a termination shock expected to be formed by the intense wind of J005311, are potential sites for radio emission via synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. In this paper, we estimate the radio emission from these two shocks, and find the peak radio flux to be 0.1--10 mJy (at 0.01--1 GHz) in the outer SNR shock and 0.01--0.1 mJy (at 1--10 GHz) in the inner termination shock. We also search for radio emission from this source in the archival data of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey at 3 GHz, NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz and the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey at 408 MHz, resulting in no significant detection. While targeted observations with higher sensitivity are desired, we particularly encourage those at higher frequency and angular resolution to probe the inner termination shock and its evolution.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula - Revealed by X-rays (T-ReX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) is the most important star-forming complex in the Local Group, offering a microscope on starburst astrophysics. At its heart lies the exceptionally rich young stellar cluster R136, containing the most massive stars known. Stellar winds and supernovae have carved 30 Dor into an amazing display of arcs, pillars, and bubbles. We present first results and advanced data processing products from the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, "The Tarantula - Revealed by X-rays" (T-ReX). The 3615 point sources in the T-ReX catalog include massive stars, compact objects, binaries, bright pre-main-sequence stars and compact young stellar (sub)clusters in 30 Dor. After removing point sources and excluding the exceptionally bright supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B), the global diffuse X-ray maps reveal hot plasma structures resolved at 1-10 pc scales, with an absorption-corrected total-band (0.5-7 keV) X-ray luminosity of $2.110\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spatially-resolved spectral modeling provides evidence for emission lines enhanced by charge-exchange processes at the interfaces. We identify a candidate for the oldest X-ray pulsar detected to date in 30 Dor, PSR J0538-6902, inside a newly-resolved arctuate X-ray wind nebula, the Manta Ray. The long time baseline of T-ReX monitored dozens of massive stars, several showing periodic variability tied to binary orbital periods, and captured strong flares from at least three low-mass Galactic foreground stars.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Content of the Young Open Cluster Berkeley 50 (IC 1310)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observed the Galactic open cluster Berkeley 50 in order to determine its stellar content, distance, and age. We obtained UBV photometry of 1145 stars in a 12.3' $\times$ 12.3' field, and used Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to identify 64 members, of which we obtained spectra of the 17 brightest members. The majority of the observed population we classified as B dwarfs, with the exception of a newly identified red supergiant star, which our spectroscopy shows has a B-type companion. Our study establishes the distance as 3.8 kpc, with an average color-excess $E(B-V)=0.9$. Comparison of the physical properties of the cluster with the Geneva evolutionary tracks places the age of the cluster as 50-60 Myr, with its most massive members being $\sim7M_\odot$.</description>
