      <title>Pairs Trading Using a Novel Graphical Matching Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairs trading, a strategy that capitalizes on price movements of asset pairs driven by similar factors, has gained significant popularity among traders. Common practice involves selecting highly cointegrated pairs to form a portfolio, which often leads to the inclusion of multiple pairs sharing common assets. This approach, while intuitive, inadvertently elevates portfolio variance and diminishes risk-adjusted returns by concentrating on a small number of highly cointegrated assets. Our study introduces an innovative pair selection method employing graphical matchings designed to tackle this challenge. We model all assets and their cointegration levels with a weighted graph, where edges signify pairs and their weights indicate the extent of cointegration. A portfolio of pairs is a subgraph of this graph. We construct a portfolio which is a maximum weighted matching of this graph to select pairs which have strong cointegration while simultaneously ensuring that there are no shared assets within any pair of pairs. This approach ensures each asset is included in just one pair, leading to a significantly lower variance in the matching-based portfolio compared to a baseline approach that selects pairs purely based on cointegration. Theoretical analysis and empirical testing using data from the S\&amp;P 500 between 2017 and 2023, affirm the efficacy of our method. Notably, our matching-based strategy showcases a marked improvement in risk-adjusted performance, evidenced by a gross Sharpe ratio of 1.23, a significant enhancement over the baseline value of 0.48 and market value of 0.59. Additionally, our approach demonstrates reduced trading costs attributable to lower turnover, alongside minimized single asset risk due to a more diversified asset base.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology, Trajectories and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury Among Hospitalized Patients: A Retrospective Multicenter Large Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome affecting almost one fifth of hospitalized patients, as well as more than half of the patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Stratifying AKI patients into groups based on severity and duration would facilitate more targeted efforts for treating AKI. Methods: In a retrospective, multicenter and longitudinal cohort study of 935,679 patients who were admitted between 2012 and 2020 to health centers included in OneFlorida+ Network, we analyzed the impact of AKI trajectories which are rapidly reversed AKI, persistent AKI with renal recovery, and persistent AKI without renal recovery on patients' clinical outcomes, including hospital, 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality, kidney replacement therapy, new chronic kidney disease (CKD) within 90 days or 1-year of discharge, CKD progression within 1-year of discharge, resource utilization, hospital disposition, and major complications during hospitalization. As analytical approaches, Kaplan-Meier estimators and survival curves, Cox proportional-hazards regression model, logistic regression model, Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance, chi-square, Fisher's exact test were used. Results: Among 2,187,254 encounters, 14% had AKI, of which 63%, 21%, and 16% had Stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively, as the worst AKI stage. Fraction of patients with persistent AKI was 31%. Patients with AKI had worse clinical outcomes and increased resource utilization compared to patients without the condition. One-year mortality was 5 times greater for patients with persistent AKI compared to those without AKI. Conclusions: Persistent AKI was associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased ICU admission and mortality compared to the other groups. This may emphasize the critical need for devising strategies targeting effective management of AKI and prevention of persisting AKI.</description>

      <title>Covariance Fitting Interferometric Phase Linking: Modular Framework and Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric phase linking (IPL) has become a prominent technique for processing images of areas containing distributed scaterrers in SAR interferometry. Traditionally, IPL consists in estimating consistent phase differences between all pairs of SAR images in a time series from the sample covariance matrix of pixel patches on a sliding window. This paper reformulates this task as a covariance fitting problem: in this setup, IPL appears as a form of projection of an input covariance matrix so that it satisfies the phase closure property. Given this modular formulation, we propose an overview of covariance matrix estimates, regularization options, and matrix distances, that can be of interest when processing multi-temporal SAR data. In particular, we will observe that most of the existing IPL algorithms appear as special instances of this framework. We then present tools to efficiently solve related optimization problems on the torus of phase-only complex vectors: majorization-minimization and Riemannian optimization. We conclude by illustrating the merits of different options on a real-world case study.</description>

      <title>A Prediction Model for Rumor Forwarding Behavior Based on Uncertain Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors in social media is mainly caused by individual retweets. This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</description>

      <title>Personalized Biopsy Schedules Using an Interval-censored Cause-specific Joint Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00105v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active surveillance (AS), where biopsies are conducted to detect cancer progression, has been acknowledged as an efficient way to reduce the overtreatment of prostate cancer. Most AS cohorts use fixed biopsy schedules for all patients. However, the ideal test frequency remains unknown, and the routine use of such invasive tests burdens the patients. An emerging idea is to generate personalized biopsy schedules based on each patient's progression-specific risk. To achieve that, we propose the interval-censored cause-specific joint model (ICJM), which models the impact of longitudinal biomarkers on cancer progression while considering the competing event of early treatment initiation. The underlying likelihood function incorporates the interval-censoring of cancer progression, the competing risk of treatment, and the uncertainty about whether cancer progression occurred since the last biopsy in patients that are right-censored or experience the competing event. The model can produce patient-specific risk profiles until a horizon time. If the risk exceeds a certain threshold, a biopsy is conducted. The optimal threshold can be chosen by balancing two indicators of the biopsy schedules: the expected number of biopsies and expected delay in detection of cancer progression. A simulation study showed that our personalized schedules could considerably reduce the number of biopsies per patient by 34%-54% compared to the fixed schedules, though at the cost of a slightly longer detection delay.</description>
