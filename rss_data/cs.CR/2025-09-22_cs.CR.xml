      <title>Synergizing Static Analysis with Large Language Models for Vulnerability Discovery and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report examines the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to improve vulnerability discovery. Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely, LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating their weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20) compared to Semgrep alone.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Assembly Language Model for Packed Executables Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting packed executables is a critical component of large-scale malware analysis and antivirus engine workflows, as it identifies samples that warrant computationally intensive dynamic unpacking to reveal concealed malicious behavior. Traditionally, packer detection techniques have relied on empirical features, such as high entropy or specific binary patterns. However, these empirical, feature-based methods are increasingly vulnerable to evasion by adversarial samples or unknown packers (e.g., low-entropy packers). Furthermore, the dependence on expert-crafted features poses challenges in sustaining and evolving these methods over time.
  In this paper, we examine the limitations of existing packer detection methods and propose Pack-ALM, a novel deep-learning-based approach for detecting packed executables. Inspired by the linguistic concept of distinguishing between real and pseudo words, we reformulate packer detection as a task of differentiating between legitimate and "pseudo" instructions. To achieve this, we preprocess native data and packed data into "pseudo" instructions and design a pre-trained assembly language model that recognizes features indicative of packed data. We evaluate Pack-ALM against leading industrial packer detection tools and state-of-the-art assembly language models. Extensive experiments on over 37,000 samples demonstrate that Pack-ALM effectively identifies packed binaries, including samples created with adversarial or previously unseen packing techniques. Moreover, Pack-ALM outperforms traditional entropy-based methods and advanced assembly language models in both detection accuracy and adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna System-assisted Physical Layer Secret Key Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates physical-layer key generation (PLKG) in multi-antenna base station systems, by leveraging a fluid antenna system (FAS) to dynamically customize radio environments. Without requiring additional nodes or extensive radio frequency chains, the FAS effectively enables adaptive antenna port selection by exploiting channel spatial correlation to enhance the key generation rate (KGR) at legitimate nodes. To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency of the FAS in PLKG, we propose an FAS-assisted PLKG model that integrates transmit beamforming and sparse port selection under independent and identically distributed and spatially correlated channel models, respectively. Specifically, the PLKG utilizes reciprocal channel probing to derive a closed-form KGR expression based on the mutual information between legitimate channel estimates. Nonconvex optimization problems for these scenarios are formulated to maximize the KGR subject to transmit power constraints and sparse port activation. We propose an iterative algorithm by capitalizing on successive convex approximation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain a locally optimal solution. A reweighted $\ell_1$-norm-based algorithm is applied to advocate for the sparse port activation of FAS-assisted PLKG. Furthermore, a low-complexity sliding window-based port selection is proposed to substitute reweighted $\ell_1$-norm method based on Rayleigh-quotient analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the FAS-PLKG scheme significantly outperforms the FA-PLKG scheme in both independent and spatially correlated environments. The sliding window-based port selection method introduced in this paper has been shown to yield superior KGR, compared to the reweighted $\ell_1$-norm method. It is shown that the FAS achieves higher KGR with fewer RF chains through dynamic sparse port selection.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning-Federated Learning Powered Intrusion Detection System for IoT/5G Advanced Edge Computing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential expansion of IoT and 5G-Advanced applications has enlarged the attack surface for DDoS, malware, and zero-day intrusions. We propose an intrusion detection system that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN), a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and an autoencoder (AE) bottleneck within a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework. The CNN-BiLSTM branch captures local and gated cross-feature interactions, while the AE emphasizes reconstruction-based anomaly sensitivity. Training occurs across edge devices without sharing raw data. On UNSW-NB15 (binary), the fused model attains AUC 99.59 percent and F1 97.36 percent; confusion-matrix analysis shows balanced error rates with high precision and recall. Average inference time is approximately 0.0476 ms per sample on our test hardware, which is well within the less than 10 ms URLLC budget, supporting edge deployment. We also discuss explainability, drift tolerance, and FL considerations for compliant, scalable 5G-Advanced IoT security.</description>

      <title>Cuckoo Attack: Stealthy and Persistent Attacks Against AI-IDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI-powered Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDEs) are increasingly defined by an Agent-centric architecture, where an LLM-powered Agent is deeply integrated to autonomously execute complex tasks. This tight integration, however, also introduces a new and critical attack surface. Attackers can exploit these components by injecting malicious instructions into untrusted external sources, effectively hijacking the Agent to perform harmful operations beyond the user's intention or awareness. This emerging threat has quickly attracted research attention, leading to various proposed attack vectors, such as hijacking Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers to access private data. However, most existing approaches lack stealth and persistence, limiting their practical impact.
  We propose the Cuckoo Attack, a novel attack that achieves stealthy and persistent command execution by embedding malicious payloads into configuration files. These files, commonly used in AI-IDEs, execute system commands during routine operations, without displaying execution details to the user. Once configured, such files are rarely revisited unless an obvious runtime error occurs, creating a blind spot for attackers to exploit. We formalize our attack paradigm into two stages, including initial infection and persistence. Based on these stages, we analyze the practicality of the attack execution process and identify the relevant exploitation techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of Cuckoo Attack, which can not only invade the developer's local computer but also achieve supply chain attacks through the spread of configuration files. We contribute seven actionable checkpoints for vendors to evaluate their product security. The critical need for these checks is demonstrated by our end-to-end Proof of Concept, which validated the proposed attack across nine mainstream Agent and AI-IDE pairs.</description>

      <title>Future-Proofing Cloud Security Against Quantum Attacks: Risk, Transition, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) introduces a transformative threat to digital security, with the potential to compromise widely deployed classical cryptographic systems. This survey offers a comprehensive and systematic examination of quantumsafe security for Cloud Computing (CC), focusing on the vulnerabilities, transition strategies, and mitigation mechanisms required to secure cloud infrastructures in the quantum era. We evaluated the landscape of quantum threats across the entire CC stack, demonstrating how quantum algorithms can undermine classical encryption and compromise cloud security at multiple architectural layers. Using a structured risk assessment methodology based on the STRIDE model, we evaluate quantum-induced attack vectors and their impact on cloud environments. To address these challenges, we propose a layered security framework that integrates hybrid cryptographic transition strategies, cryptographic agility, and proactive risk mitigation. We analyze the preparation and implementation approaches of the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including AWS, Azure and GCP, synthesizing platform-specific initiatives toward Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Furthermore, we provide a detailed evaluation of standardized PQC algorithms, exploring their resilience to side-channel and active attacks within cloud-native deployments. This survey serves as a strategic reference for cloud architects, policymakers, and researchers, offering actionable insights for navigating the complex transition to quantum-resilient cloud systems. We conclude by identifying six key future research directions: standardization and interoperability, performance and scalability, implementation security, integration with emerging technologies, systemic preparedness, and crypto-agile migration frameworks.</description>

      <title>Inference Attacks on Encrypted Online Voting via Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online voting enables individuals to participate in elections remotely, offering greater efficiency and accessibility in both governmental and organizational settings. As this method gains popularity, ensuring the security of online voting systems becomes increasingly vital, as the systems supporting it must satisfy a demanding set of security requirements. Most research in this area emphasizes the design and verification of cryptographic protocols to protect voter integrity and system confidentiality. However, other vectors, such as network traffic analysis, remain relatively understudied, even though they may pose significant threats to voter privacy and the overall trustworthiness of the system.
  In this paper, we examine how adversaries can exploit metadata from encrypted network traffic to uncover sensitive information during online voting. Our analysis reveals that, even without accessing the encrypted content, it is possible to infer critical voter actions, such as whether a person votes, the exact moment a ballot is submitted, and whether the ballot is valid or spoiled. We test these attacks with both rule-based techniques and machine learning methods. We evaluate our attacks on two widely used online voting platforms, one proprietary and one partially open source, achieving classification accuracy as high as 99.5%. These results expose a significant privacy vulnerability that threatens key properties of secure elections, including voter secrecy and protection against coercion or vote-buying. We explore mitigations to our attacks, demonstrating that countermeasures such as payload padding and timestamp equalization can substantially limit their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Flying Drones to Locate Cyber-Attackers in LoRaWAN Metropolitan Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, many critical services and industrial systems rely on wireless networks for interaction with the IoT, hence becoming vulnerable to a broad number of cyber-threats. While detecting this kind of attacks is not difficult with common cyber-security tools, and even trivial for jamming, finding their origin and identifying culprits is almost impossible today, yet indispensable to stop them, especially when attacks are generated with portable or self-made devices that continuously move around. To address this open challenge, the FOLLOWME project investigates the feasibility of using UAV to locate and even chase attackers during illicit usage of the radio spectrum. The main objective is to develop a cyber-physical security framework that integrates network telemetry with wireless localization. The former triggers alarms in case of anomalies or known attack patterns and provides a coarse-grained indication of the physical area (i.e., the position of affected access gateways), whereas the latter systematically scans such area to identify the exact location of the attacker. The project will specifically address long-range metropolitan area networks and focus on the LoRaWAN protocol, which is the typical scenario for Smart City services.</description>

      <title>Hornet Node and the Hornet DSL: A Minimal, Executable Specification for Bitcoin Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitcoin's consensus rules are encoded in the implementation of its reference client: "The code is the spec." Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Robust Behavior Sequence Anomaly Detection Approach Based on Critical Behavior Unit Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem. We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against obfuscation attacks.</description>

      <title>A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce an acceptable monitoring overload.</description>

      <title>ConCap: Practical Network Traffic Generation for Flow-based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been studied in research for almost four decades. Yet, despite thousands of papers claiming scientific advances, a non-negligible number of recent works suggest that the findings of prior literature may be questionable. At the root of such a disagreement is the well-known challenge of obtaining data representative of a real-world network-and, hence, usable for security assessments. We tackle such a challenge in this paper. We propose ConCap, a practical tool meant to facilitate experimental research on NIDS. Through ConCap, a researcher can set up an isolated and lightweight network environment and configure it to produce network-related data, such as packets or NetFlows, that are automatically labeled, hence ready for fine-grained experiments. ConCap is rooted on open-source software and is designed to foster experimental reproducibility across the scientific community by sharing just one configuration file. Through comprehensive experiments on 10 different network activities, further expanded via in-depth analyses of 21 variants of two specific activities and of 100 repetitions of four other ones, we empirically verify that ConCap produces network data resembling that of a real-world network. We also carry out experiments on well-known benchmark datasets as well as on a real "smart-home" network, showing that, from a cyber-detection viewpoint, ConCap's automatically-labeled NetFlows are functionally equivalent to those collected in other environments. Finally, we show that ConCap enables to safely reproduce sophisticated attack chains (e.g., to test/enhance existing NIDS). Altogether, ConCap is a solution to the "data problem" that is plaguing NIDS research.</description>

      <title>How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an 8-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- present only in blocks from a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that exclusive transactions account for 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Furthermore, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully explained by exclusive relationships between senders and builders: about 7% of all exclusive transactions included on-chain, by value, come from senders who route exclusively to a single builder. Analyzing transaction logs shows that some exclusive transactions are duplicates or variations of the same strategy, but even accounting for that, the share of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks is at least 77.2%. Taken together, our findings highlight that exclusive transactions are the dominant source of builder revenues.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from six heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a novel tool for the systematic assessment of privacy in tabular data, we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, minor issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables (age, sex, race, income, and geolocation) represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>

      <title>Impact of Phonetics on Speaker Identity in Adversarial Voice Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial perturbations in speech pose a serious threat to automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker verification by introducing subtle waveform modifications that remain imperceptible to humans but can significantly alter system outputs. While targeted attacks on end-to-end ASR models have been widely studied, the phonetic basis of these perturbations and their effect on speaker identity remain underexplored. In this work, we analyze adversarial audio at the phonetic level and show that perturbations exploit systematic confusions such as vowel centralization and consonant substitutions. These distortions not only mislead transcription but also degrade phonetic cues critical for speaker verification, leading to identity drift. Using DeepSpeech as our ASR target, we generate targeted adversarial examples and evaluate their impact on speaker embeddings across genuine and impostor samples. Results across 16 phonetically diverse target phrases demonstrate that adversarial audio induces both transcription errors and identity drift, highlighting the need for phonetic-aware defenses to ensure the robustness of ASR and speaker recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Angelfish: Consensus with Optimal Throughput and Latency Across the Leader-DAG Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize performance, many modern blockchain systems rely on eventually-synchronous, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols. Two protocol designs have emerged in this space: protocols that minimize latency using a leader that drives both data dissemination and consensus, and protocols that maximize throughput using a separate, asynchronous data dissemination layer. Recent protocols such as Partially-Synchronous Bullshark and Sailfish combine elements of both approaches by using a DAG to enable parallel data dissemination and a leader that paces DAG formation. This improves latency while achieving state-of-the-art throughput. Yet the latency of leader-based protocols is still better under moderate loads.
  We present Angelfish, a hybrid protocol that adapts smoothly across this design space, from leader-based to Sailfish-like DAG-based consensus. Angelfish lets a dynamically-adjusted subset of parties use best-effort broadcast to issue lightweight votes instead of reliably broadcasting costlier DAG vertices. This reduces communication, helps lagging nodes catch up, and lowers latency in practice compared to prior DAG-based protocols. Our empirical evaluation shows that Angelfish attains state-of-the-art peak throughput while matching the latency of leader-based protocols under moderate throughput, delivering the best of both worlds.</description>

      <title>Automated Cyber Defense with Generalizable Graph-based Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for automated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately, these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs. This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of complex, and multi-agent environments.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Just-In-Time Liquidity Provision in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquidity providers (LPs) are essential figures in the operation of automated market makers (AMMs); in exchange for transaction fees, LPs lend the liquidity that allows AMMs to operate. While many prior works have studied the incentive structures of LPs in general, we currently lack a principled understanding of a special class of LPs known as Just-In-Time (JIT) LPs. These are strategic agents who momentarily supply liquidity for a single swap, in an attempt to extract disproportionately high fees relative to the remaining passive LPs. This paper provides the first formal, transaction-level model of JIT liquidity provision for a widespread class of AMMs known as Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs), as seen in Uniswap V3, for instance. We characterize the landscape of price impact and fee allocation in these systems, formulate and analyze a non-linear optimization problem faced by JIT LPs, and prove the existence of an optimal strategy. By fitting our optimal solution for JIT LPs to real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools (particularly those with risky assets), there is a significant gap between observed and optimal JIT behavior. Existing JIT LPs often fail to account for price impact; doing so, we estimate they could increase earnings by up to 69% on average over small time windows. We also show that JIT liquidity, when deployed strategically, can improve market efficiency by reducing slippage for traders, albeit at the cost of eroding average passive LP profits by up to 44% per trade.</description>

      <title>Unique Security and Privacy Threats of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in natural language processing. These models are trained on vast datasets to exhibit powerful language understanding and generation capabilities across various applications, including chatbots, and agents. However, LLMs have revealed a variety of privacy and security issues throughout their life cycle, drawing significant academic and industrial attention. Moreover, the risks faced by LLMs differ significantly from those encountered by traditional language models. Given that current surveys lack a clear taxonomy of unique threat models across diverse scenarios, we emphasize the unique privacy and security threats associated with four specific scenarios: pre-training, fine-tuning, deployment, and LLM-based agents. Addressing the characteristics of each risk, this survey outlines and analyzes potential countermeasures. Research on attack and defense situations can offer feasible research directions, enabling more areas to benefit from LLMs.</description>

      <title>SeCodePLT: A Unified Platform for Evaluating the Security of Code GenAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for evaluating the security risks and capabilities (e.g., vulnerability detection) of code-generating large language models (LLMs) face several key limitations: (1) limited coverage of risk and capabilities; (2) reliance on static evaluation metrics such as LLM judgments or rule-based detection, which lack the precision of dynamic analysis; and (3) a trade-off between data quality and benchmark scale. To address these challenges, we introduce a general and scalable benchmark construction framework that begins with manually validated, high-quality seed examples and expands them via targeted mutations. Our approach provides a comprehensive suite of artifacts so the benchmark can support comprehensive risk assessment and security capability evaluation using dynamic metrics. By combining expert insights with automated generation, we strike a balance between manual effort, data quality, and benchmark scale. Applying this framework to Python, C/C++, and Java, we build SeCodePLT, a dataset of more than 5.9k samples spanning 44 CWE-based risk categories and three security capabilities. Compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, SeCodePLT offers broader coverage, higher data fidelity, and substantially greater scale. We use SeCodePLT to evaluate leading code LLMs and agents, revealing their strengths and weaknesses in both generating secure code and identifying or fixing vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Tag&amp;Tab: Pretraining Data Detection in Large Language Models Using Keyword-Based Membership Inference Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools for digital task assistance. Their training relies heavily on the collection of vast amounts of data, which may include copyright-protected or sensitive information. Recent studies on detecting pretraining data in LLMs have primarily focused on sentence- or paragraph-level membership inference attacks (MIAs), usually involving probability analysis of the target model's predicted tokens. However, these methods often exhibit poor accuracy, failing to account for the semantic importance of textual content and word significance. To address these shortcomings, we propose Tag&amp;Tab, a novel approach for detecting data used in LLM pretraining. Our method leverages established natural language processing (NLP) techniques to tag keywords in the input text, a process we term Tagging. Then, the LLM is used to obtain probabilities for these keywords and calculate their average log-likelihood to determine input text membership, a process we refer to as Tabbing. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets (BookMIA, MIMIR, PatentMIA, and the Pile) and several open-source LLMs of varying sizes demonstrate an average increase in AUC scores ranging from 5.3% to 17.6% over state-of-the-art methods. Tag&amp;Tab not only sets a new standard for data leakage detection in LLMs, but its outstanding performance is a testament to the importance of words in MIAs on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder for Efficient and Sustainable Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digitalization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>AdaSteer: Your Aligned LLM is Inherently an Adaptive Jailbreak Defender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable model internals for real-time, flexible safety enforcement in LLMs.</description>

      <title>SecReEvalBench: A Multi-turned Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models in security-sensitive domains necessitates rigorous evaluation of their resilience against adversarial prompt-based attacks. While previous benchmarks have focused on security evaluations with limited and predefined attack domains, such as cybersecurity attacks, they often lack a comprehensive assessment of intent-driven adversarial prompts and the consideration of real-life scenario-based multi-turn attacks. To address this gap, we present SecReEvalBench, the Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark, which defines four novel metrics: Prompt Attack Resilience Score, Prompt Attack Refusal Logic Score, Chain-Based Attack Resilience Score and Chain-Based Attack Rejection Time Score. Moreover, SecReEvalBench employs six questioning sequences for model assessment: one-off attack, successive attack, successive reverse attack, alternative attack, sequential ascending attack with escalating threat levels and sequential descending attack with diminishing threat levels. In addition, we introduce a dataset customized for the benchmark, which incorporates both neutral and malicious prompts, categorised across seven security domains and sixteen attack techniques. In applying this benchmark, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art open-weighted large language models, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen 3. Our findings offer critical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of modern large language models in defending against evolving adversarial threats. The SecReEvalBench dataset is publicly available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/5a7ee22cf9dab6c93b55a73f630f6c9b42e936351b0ae98fbae6ddaca7fe248d, which provides a groundwork for advancing research in large language model security.</description>

      <title>PickleBall: Secure Deserialization of Pickle-based Machine Learning Models (Extended Report)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive (but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9% of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module. PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on code reuse techniques.</description>

      <title>LLMs in the SOC: An Empirical Study of Human-AI Collaboration in Security Operations Centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Security Operations Centres (SOCs) presents a transformative, yet still evolving, opportunity to reduce analyst workload through human-AI collaboration. However, their real-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over 10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for sensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes determinations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries are related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining technical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of queries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework), underscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations in tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional exploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use among a subset of analysts. We find that LLMs function as flexible, on-demand cognitive aids that augment, rather than replace, SOC expertise. Our study provides actionable guidance for designing context-aware, human-centred AI assistance in security operations, highlighting the need for further in-the-wild research on real-world analyst-LLM collaboration, challenges, and impacts.</description>

      <title>AmphiKey: A Dual-Mode Secure Authenticated Key Encapsulation Protocol for Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AmphiKey, a dual-mode post-quantum/traditional (PQ/T) hybrid authenticated key exchange mechanism (AKEM) has been designed to secure smart grid communications against both classical and quantum threats. AmphiKey offers two distinct operational modes within a single framework: an Authenticated Mode and a Deniable Mode. The Authenticated Mode employs a blackbox approach, combining ephemeral ML-KEM-768 and X25519 with long-term Raccoon DSA keys to provide forward secrecy and strong, non-repudiable authenticity. This design achieves "OR" confidentiality, where security holds if either of the KEMs is unbroken, and robust "AND" authenticity. For the signature operation, it leverages the 'masking-friendly' Raccoon digital signature (DSA), which is specifically designed for side-channel attack resistance, though this protection is localized to the signing key and does not provide deniability. In contrast, Deniable Mode provides deniable authentication, preserving privacy. The protocol used ML-KEM-768 (AKEM-1), Ephemeral X25519 (AKEM-2), Raccoon-based DSA (Rac) (compared performance to ML-DSA-65), and the Ascon cipher to deliver its security guarantees. Key contributions include providing a flexible protocol with enhanced security, optional deniability, and efficiency adapted to the diverse needs of the smart grid infrastructure. We present a comprehensive performance evaluation on a heterogeneous testbed featuring a powerful server and client (AMD Ryzen 5) and a resource-constrained client (Raspberry Pi). In efficient Deniable mode, the full handshake completes in 0.15 ms on the server and 0.41 ms on the Raspberry Pi client. In contrast, the Authenticated Mode is bottlenecked by the client-side signature generation; the handshake takes 4.8 ms for the Raspberry Pi client to initiate and 0.84 ms for the server to verify.</description>

      <title>On the Security of Tool-Invocation Prompts for LLM-Based Agentic Systems: An Empirical Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</description>

      <title>When Secure Isn't: Assessing the Security of Machine Learning Model Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of model-sharing through frameworks and dedicated hubs makes Machine Learning significantly more accessible. Despite their benefits, these tools expose users to underexplored security risks, while security awareness remains limited among both practitioners and developers. To enable a more security-conscious culture in Machine Learning model sharing, in this paper we evaluate the security posture of frameworks and hubs, assess whether security-oriented mechanisms offer real protection, and survey how users perceive the security narratives surrounding model sharing. Our evaluation shows that most frameworks and hubs address security risks partially at best, often by shifting responsibility to the user. More concerningly, our analysis of frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing uncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through this analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is largely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used for sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security narrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy, despite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and suggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the Voynich Manuscript was almost certainly written left-to-right (LTR), the question whether the underlying script or cipher reads LTR or right-to-left (RTL) has received little quantitative attention. We introduce a statistical method that leverages n-gram perplexity asymmetry to determine directional bias in character sequences.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity AI: Humanoid Robots as Attack Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic security assessment of the Unitree G1 humanoid showing it operates simultaneously as a covert surveillance node and can be purposed as an active cyber operations platform. Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.</description>

      <title>Threat Modeling for Enhancing Security of IoT Audio Classification Devices under a Secure Protocols Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of IoT nodes equipped with microphones and capable of performing on-device audio classification exposes highly sensitive data while operating under tight resource constraints. To protect against this, we present a defence-in-depth architecture comprising a security protocol that treats the edge device, cellular network and cloud backend as three separate trust domains, linked by TPM-based remote attestation and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3. A STRIDE-driven threat model and attack-tree analysis guide the design. At startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs. The node can only decrypt its LUKS-sealed partitions after the cloud has verified a TPM quote and released a one-time unlock key. This ensures that rogue or tampered devices remain inert. Data in transit is protected by TLS 1.3 and hybridised with Kyber and Dilithium to provide post-quantum resilience. Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption and integrity hashes safeguard extracted audio features. Signed, rollback-protected AI models and tamper-responsive sensors harden firmware and hardware. Data at rest follows a 3-2-1 strategy comprising a solid-state drive sealed with LUKS, an offline cold archive encrypted with a hybrid post-quantum cipher and an encrypted cloud replica. Finally, we set out a plan for evaluating the physical and logical security of the proposed protocol.</description>

      <title>Watermarking and Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning Models for LORA RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset, our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC, offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.</description>

      <title>FRIDA: Free-Rider Detection using Privacy Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is increasingly popular as it enables multiple parties with limited datasets and resources to train a machine learning model collaboratively. However, similar to other collaborative systems, federated learning is vulnerable to free-riders - participants who benefit from the global model without contributing. Free-riders compromise the integrity of the learning process and slow down the convergence of the global model, resulting in increased costs for honest participants. To address this challenge, we propose FRIDA: free-rider detection using privacy attacks. Instead of focusing on implicit effects of free-riding, FRIDA utilizes membership and property inference attacks to directly infer evidence of genuine client training. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that FRIDA is effective across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pod: An Optimal-Latency, Censorship-Free, and Accountable Generalized Consensus Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14931v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the inherent issues of high latency in blockchains and low scalability in traditional consensus protocols. We present pod, a novel notion of consensus whose first priority is to achieve the physically-optimal latency of $2\delta$, or one round-trip, i.e., requiring only one network trip (duration $\delta$) for writing a transaction and one for reading it.
  To accomplish this, we first eliminate inter-replica communication. Instead, clients send transactions directly to all replicas, which independently process transactions and append them to local logs. Replicas assigns a timestamp and a sequence number to each transaction in their logs, allowing clients to extract valuable metadata about the transactions and the system state. Later on, clients retrieve these logs and extract transactions (and associated metadata) from them.
  Necessarily, this construction achieves weaker properties than a total-order broadcast protocol, due to existing lower bounds. Our work models the primitive of pod and defines its security properties. We then show pod-core, a protocol that satisfies properties such as transaction confirmation within $2\delta$, censorship resistance against Byzantine replicas, and accountability for safety violations. We show that single-shot auctions can be realized using the pod notion and observe that it is also sufficient for other popular applications.</description>

      <title>Are Vision-Language Models Safe in the Wild? A Meme-Based Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms. MemeSafetyBench is publicly available at https://github.com/oneonlee/Meme-Safety-Bench.</description>
