      <title>Lessons from Chalcopyrites for Scaling Thin Film Perovskite Photovoltaic Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</description>

      <title>Synchronous polarization switching at sub-coercive fields through stochastic resonance in ferroelectric thin-film capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon by which the presence of noise in a non-linear system allows for detection of a weak sub-threshold signal, or in a bi-stable system allows for sub-coercive switching between the two states. Simple theory suggests that SR occurs when the Kramers rate (rk) of the bistable system, which is a function of noise and applied voltage, is twice the drive frequency (fsignal). Here, we demonstrate the synchronous switching of polarization with a sub-coercive voltage waveform, in a thin film ferroelectric lead zirconium titanate (PZT) capacitor through SR. We employ independent figures of merit (FOM) such as cross-covariance, output power and signal-to-noise ratio to experimentally identify the optimal noise for synchronous switching. We further experimentally measure the Kramers time in the ferroelectric, and show that FOMs indeed peak near the noise predicted by the SR condition. We also model the device characteristics using the stochastic Time Dependent Landau Ginzburg (TDGL) formulation, and capture the experimentally observed polarization switching under application of sub-coercive voltage, assisted by noise. Finally, we show a proof-of-concept implementation of detecting sub-threshold frequency-shift-key signals (FSK) in noisy communication channels using our ferroelectric PZT devices.</description>

      <title>From plasma to pattern: observation and characterization of periodic structure formation in dielectric breakdown channels of electron-irradiated insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators.</description>

      <title>Stretchable and self-adhesive triboelectric sensor for real-time musculoskeletal monitoring and personalized recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in medical diagnostics have highlighted the importance of wearable technologies for continuous and real-time physiological monitoring. In this study, we introduce a flexible, self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator (MB-TENG) engineered from commercially available medical elastic bandages for biomechanical sensing during rehabilitation and gait analysis. Leveraging the porous and skin-friendly properties of the bandage combined with a PTFE film, the MB-TENG delivers robust electrical performance, achieving a peak open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 122~V, a short-circuit current (ISC) of 25~$\mu$A, and a transferred charge (QSC) of 110~nC, while maintaining long-term stability across 40{,}000 mechanical cycles. Its inherent self-adhesive property allows for multi-layer assembly without extra bonding agents, and mechanical stretching enhances output, enabling dual configurability. A stacked design further improves the power capacity, supporting applications in wearable medical electronics. The MB-TENG device seamlessly conforms to joint surfaces and foot regions, providing accurate detection of motion states and abnormal gait patterns. These features underscore the MB-TENG's potential as a low-cost, scalable platform for personalized rehabilitation, injury monitoring, and early musculoskeletal diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Analysis of Cryogenically Cooled Photocathode in a CW SRF Injector cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at 5 W incident laser power reaches a weak thermal limit, thereby establishing a design constraint and requires further optimization.</description>

      <title>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; nonetheless, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be explored rigorously. This paper introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to grasp the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>Dopant site occupancy determined by core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</description>

      <title>Hubbard energy dependence of electronic structures in rare-earth monoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</description>

      <title>Structural, optical, and dielectric properties of Cr-doped ZnO films via DC magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cr-doped ZnO films were fabricated by a new but feasible method, that is, annealing Cr-Zn layers deposited via DC magnetron sputtering in air. Microstructures of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, intrinsic point defects were identified via photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and dielectric properties were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and dielectric spectrometer, respectively. It was found that the average grain sizes decrease (56.34 - 39.50 nm), the band gap increases (from 3.18 to 3.23 eV), and the transmittance (at 600 nm) decreases (from 91% to 83%) with increasing Cr. Two activation energies of conduction increase after doping Cr, indicating enhanced temperature stability. At optimal Cr levels, ZnO films exhibit high transmittance and conductivity, exhibiting potential for transparent electrode development. This method can be extended to other doped ZnO films, such as Al-doped ZnO transparent electrodes, to achieve simultaneous improvements in transmittance, conductivity, and stability for flexible and wearable applications.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Resolution Benchmark Framework for Spatial Reasoning Assessment in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Defects on Thermal Transport across Solid/Solid Heterogeneous Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities and defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects affect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale thermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects. The effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport characteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal conductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show that, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects weakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC. Furthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon spectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC interface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a defect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present in GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior arises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The redistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are more capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This study enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across semiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of high-ITC heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Dramatic Enhancement of Supercontinuum Generation in H$_2$O by Non-Harmonic Two-Color Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dramatic enhancement of supercontinuum generation (SCG) in H$_2$O driven by non-harmonic two-color laser fields, where pump and seed frequencies are not integer multiples. This scheme yields a broadband SC spectrum enhanced by approximately three orders of magnitude over the single-color case. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis, including isotope effects, show that the enhancement arises from soliton compression with resonant dispersive wave (RDW) emission, phase- and group-velocity-matched four-wave mixing (FWM), and cross-phase modulation (XPM), offering a versatile route to stronger SCG and noise suppression in broadband spectroscopy in H$_2$O, an emerging topic in attosecond and surface physics.</description>

      <title>The R-index: A universal metric for evaluating OAM content and mode purity in optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its pivotal role in optical manipulation, high-capacity communications, and quantum information, a general measure of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in structured light remains elusive. In optical fields, where multiple vortices coexist, the local nature of vortex OAM and the absence of a common rotation axis make the total OAM of the field difficult to quantify. Here, we introduce the R-index, a metric that captures the intrinsic OAM content of any structured optical field, from pure Laguerre-Gaussian modes to arbitrary multi-vortex superpositions. Not only does this metric quantify the total OAM, it also assesses field purity, providing insight into the fidelity and robustness of the OAM generation. By unifying OAM characterization into a single figure of merit, the R-index enables direct comparison across diverse beam profiles and facilitates the identification of optimal configurations for both foundational studies and applied technologies.</description>

      <title>Neutralizing Optical Defects in GeSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reports of photoluminescence from GeSn grown on Ge substrates by molecular beam epitaxy have been limited. We find that one limiting factor to observing photoluminescence is due to localized defect states marked by photoluminescence at 2400 nm and originating from the Ge substrate and buffer layer. In this study, we report on an optical study utilizing doped Ge(001) substrates to effectively suppress defect-related photoluminescence in GeSn layers by filling localized defect trap states. For this experiment, a GeSn layer with Sn content up to 10.5% was grown on a doped Ge(001) substrate. Analysis of the physics of the photoluminescence spectrum collected from the GeSn thin film shows an emission at the expected wavelength of 2300 nm for 10.5% Sn content and the absence of the typically observed defect related signal at 2400 nm. This understanding is further confirmed using short pulse optical excitation of the GeSn grown on undoped Ge substrates.</description>

      <title>Modeling wind farm noise emission and propagation: effects of flow and layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13128v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation and downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is modeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves as input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first turbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN) contribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher frequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN mostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more pronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than in staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall because turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow significantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition modifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an isolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound focusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to higher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm compared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based on isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating flow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of wind farms.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of solid-state defect spins via patterned boron-doped diamond circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolithic integration, which refers to the incorporation of all device functionalities within a single material, shows significant potential for creating scalable solid-state quantum devices. This study demonstrated the coherent control of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins using an electronic circuit monolithically integrated within diamond: a patterned, conductive boron-doped diamond (BDD) microwave waveguide. First, we validated the high-frequency performance of the circuit by characterizing its impedance up to the microwave range, confirming its capability for efficient microwave transmission. Then, using this monolithically integrated BDD--NV hybrid system, we performed optically detected magnetic resonance and observed noticeable Rabi oscillations driven by the metallic BDD circuit. Importantly, we verified that the BDD antenna has a minimal detrimental impact on the NV spins; microwave-induced heating is negligible under both pulsed and continuous driving, and the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) remains unperturbed. This approach paves the way for a new class of compact, robust, and versatile quantum platforms suitable for sensing and information processing in various environments.</description>

      <title>Tuning electrochemical reactions with ratchet-based ion pumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrochemical reactions are highly sensitive to the physical and chemical environment near the electrodes. Thus, controlling the electrolyte ionic composition and the electrochemical potential of specific ions can modify the overpotential of electrochemical reactions and enhance their selectivity toward the desired products. Ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) are membrane-like devices that utilize temporal potential modulation to drive a net ionic flux with no associated electrochemical reactions. RBIPs were fabricated by coating the surfaces of nanoporous alumina wafers with metals, forming nanoporous capacitors. Placing the RBIP between two electrolyte compartments and applying an alternating signal between the metal layers resulted in a voltage buildup across the membrane, leading to ion pumping. Here, we demonstrate that by modifying the electrochemical potential of ions, RBIPs can accelerate or inhibit electrochemical reactions on the surface of adjacent water-splitting electrodes according to the RBIP input signal. Proton pumping towards a water-splitting cathode prevented proton depletion due to the hydrogen evolution reaction and maintained the pH in the cathode compartment. The combination of ion pumping and ion selectivity can enable the electrolyte composition to be tuned near the electrodes, providing greater control over the electrochemical process.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Vertical $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Diodes on Sapphire Using All-LPCVD Growth and Plasma-Free Ga-Assisted Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work demonstrates quasi-vertical beta-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) fabricated on c-plane sapphire using an all-LPCVD, plasma-free process integrating epitaxial growth of high-quality beta-Ga2O3 and in-situ Ga-assisted etching. A 6.3 micron-thick (-201)-oriented beta-Ga2O3 layer was grown on c-sapphire with a 6-degree miscut, comprising a 3.15 micron moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer and a heavily doped (1e19 cm^-3) contact layer on a UID buffer. Mesa isolation used Ga-assisted LPCVD etching with 3.6 micron vertical profiles. SBDs showed excellent forward J-V behavior: 1.22 V turn-on, 1.29 ideality factor, and 0.83 eV barrier height. Minimum differential specific on-resistance was 8.6 mOhm*cm^2 with high current density (252 A/cm^2 at 5 V). C-V profiling revealed uniform doping at 2.1e17 cm^-3. J-V-T from 25 C to 250 C confirmed thermionic emission. Barrier height increased from 0.80 to 1.16 eV, and ideality factor from 1.31 to 1.42. Reverse leakage current remained low, increasing from ~5e-6 A/cm^2 to ~1e-4 A/cm^2; Ion/Ioff decreased from ~1e7 to 5e5. Breakdown voltages with moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer ranged between 59 and 100 V, with corresponding fields of 1.49 to 1.94 MV/cm. These results highlight the potential of LPCVD-grown and etched beta-Ga2O3 devices for high-performance power electronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a significantly reduced cost to OPA implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KAB-SRS by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that are in excellent agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce GeV-scale muons in numbers far exceeding those from cosmic background. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high yields, which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitation of ordered quantum phases gives rise to collective modes and quasiparticles, as exemplified by spin waves and magnons emerging from magnetic order. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of polarization waves and their fundamental quanta, ferrons. Here, we report the generation and transport of polarization waves, i.e., coherent ferrons, in the van der Waals ferroelectric material NbOI2. Upon excitation by a short laser pulse, the polarization wave emits intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) radiation at the ferroelectric transverse optical phonon frequency, modulates the ferroelectric order parameter, and propagates uniaxially along the polar axis at hypersonic velocities of ~105 m/s. These long-lived, uniaxial, and dipole-carrying polarization waves may find applications in narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and coherent electric control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former is limited by fiber-optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.</description>
