      <title>Conservative stochastic PDEs on the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a well-posedness theory for conservative stochastic partial differential equations on the whole space. This class of stochastic PDEs arises in fluctuating hydrodynamics, and includes the Dean--Kawasaki equation with correlated noise. In combination with the analysis of the authors and Heydecker [35], the connection between fluctuating hydrodynamics and macroscopic fluctuation theory in the context of the zero range particle process is made rigorous.</description>

      <title>Truncation of long-range percolation with non-summable interactions in dimensions $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider independent long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 3$. Assuming that the expected degree of the origin is infinite, we show that there exists an $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that an infinite open cluster remains after deleting all edges of length at least $N$. For the isotropic case in dimensions $d\geq 3$, we show that if the expected degree of the origin is at least $10^{400}$, then there exists an infinite open cluster almost surely. We also use these results to prove corresponding statements for the long-range $q$-states Potts model.</description>

      <title>The bigeodesic Brownian plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a random non-compact space called the bigeodesic Brownian plane, and prove that it is the tangent plane in distribution of the Brownian sphere at a point of its simple geodesic from the root (for the local Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov-Uniform topology). We also show that it is the local limit of the Brownian plane rerooted further and further on its unique infinite geodesic. Furthermore, we discuss various properties of this space, such as its topology, the behavior of its geodesic rays, and its invariance in distribution under several natural transformations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Stability Theory for Classical and Monotone Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper integrates two strands of the literature on stability of general state Markov chains: conventional, total variation based results and more recent order-theoretic results. First we introduce a complete metric over Borel probability measures based on partial stochastic dominance. We then show that many conventional results framed in the setting of total variation distance have natural generalizations to the partially ordered setting when this metric is adopted.</description>

      <title>The support function of the high-dimensional Poisson polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_\lambda^d$ be the convex hull of the intersection of the homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 2$, with the Euclidean unit ball $\mathbb{B}^d$. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior as $d\to\infty$ of the support function $h_\lambda^{(d)}(u) :=\sup_{x\in K_\lambda^d}\langle u,x\rangle$ in an arbitrary direction $u \in {\mathbb S}^{d-1}$ of the Poisson polytope $K_\lambda^d$. We identify three different regimes (subcritical, critical, and supercritical) in terms of the intensity $\lambda:=\lambda(d)$ and derive in each regime the precise distributional convergence of $h_\lambda^{(d)}$ after suitable scaling. We especially treat this question when the support function is considered over multiple directions at once. We finally deduce partial counterparts for the radius-vector function of the polytope.</description>

      <title>Stretching of Polymers and turbulence:Fokker Planck equation, special stochastic scaling limit and stationary law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of polymer. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

Abstract: We explore a unified $(k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m)$-run in multi-state trials, examining its distributional properties and waiting time distribution. Our study reveals that this particular run serves as a generalization encompassing various patterns. Additionally, we discuss various results pertaining to existing patterns as special cases. To illustrate our findings, we provide an application related to DNA frequent patterns.</description>

      <title>On explosion time in stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the explosion time of the solution to autonomous stochastic differential equations driven by the fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H&gt;1/2$. With the help of the Lamperti transformation, we are able to tackle the case of non-constant diffusion coefficients not covered in the literature. In addition, we provide an adaptive Euler-type numerical scheme for approximating the explosion time.</description>

      <title>Functional Stochastic Differential Equations with Positivity Constraints Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a stochastic functional differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H&gt;1/2, constrained to be reflected at 0. We prove the existence of solutions using the Euler method. However, uniqueness is demonstrated only under the condition that the fractional term exhibits constant argument deviation. Additionally, we establish the convergence of the method.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue measure of one generalised set of subsums of geometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a set that can be treated as a generalised set of subsums for a geometric series. This object was discovered independently in various mathematical aspects. For instance, it is closely related to various systems of representation of real numbers. The main object of this paper was particularly studied by R. Kenyon, who brought up a question about the Lebesgue measure of the set and conjectured that it is positive. Further, Z. Nitecki confirmed the hypothesis by using nontrivial topological techniques. However, the aforementioned result is quite limited, as this particular case should satisfy a rigid condition of homogeneity. Despite the limited progress, the problem remained understudied in a general framework.</description>

      <title>Quasi-reversible bullet models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a large class of bullet models that contains, in particular, the colliding bullet models with creations. For this large class of bullet models, we give sufficient conditions on their parameter to be $\text{rot}(\pi)$-quasi-reversible and to be $\text{rot}(\pi/2)$-quasi-reversible. Moreover, those conditions assure them that one of their invariant measures is described by a Poisson Point Processes. This result applied to the colliding bullet models with creations is a first step to study its property under its non-empty invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Simulating Simple Random Walks With a Deck of Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00831v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we want to simulate the realization of a symmetric simple random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, we use $(2d)$-side fair dice to decide to which neighbor it jumps at each step if $d\geq 2$ or we simply use a fair coin when $d=1$. Assume that instead of using a dice or a coin we want to do a simulation using a well shuffled deck with $K$ cards of each of the $2d$ suits. In the first step the probability of jumping to each neighbor is $(2d)^{-1}$, but from the second step it becomes biased. Of course if we continue performing this simulation, the total variation distance between its law and the law of the random walk will increase until all cards are used. In this paper we investigate the minimum number of cards $N=2d K$ that a deck must contain so that the total variation distance between the law of a $n$-step simulation and the law of a $n$-step realization of the random walk is smaller than a chosen threshold $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. More generally, we prove that when $N=cn$ this distance converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a Gaussian profile which depends on $c\geq 2d$. Furthermore, our analysis shows that this Gaussian profile vanishes as $c \to \infty$, proving the convergence of a multivariate hypergeometric distribution to a multinomial distribution in total variation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries for the gKPZ equation via multi-indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the two main symmetries for the one-dimensional generalised KPZ equation (gKPZ): the chain rule and the It\^o Isometry. We consider the equation in the full-subcritical regimes and use multi-indices that avoid an over-parametrization of the renormalised equation to compute the dimension of the two spaces associated with these two symmetries. Our proof is quite elementary and shows that multi-indices provide in this case a simplification in comparison to the results obtained via decorated trees. It also completes the program on the study of the chain rule initiated in arxiv:1902.02884 and continued in arxiv:2403.17066.</description>

      <title>Entropy contraction of the Gibbs sampler under log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbs sampler (a.k.a. Glauber dynamics and heat-bath algorithm) is a popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively samples from the conditional distributions of a probability measure $\pi$ of interest. Under the assumption that $\pi$ is strongly log-concave, we show that the random scan Gibbs sampler contracts in relative entropy and provide a sharp characterization of the associated contraction rate. Assuming that evaluating conditionals is cheap compared to evaluating the joint density, our results imply that the number of full evaluations of $\pi$ needed for the Gibbs sampler to mix grows linearly with the condition number and is independent of the dimension. If $\pi$ is non-strongly log-concave, the convergence rate in entropy degrades from exponential to polynomial. Our techniques are versatile and extend to Metropolis-within-Gibbs schemes and the Hit-and-Run algorithm. A comparison with gradient-based schemes and the connection with the optimization literature are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Systemic Risk Asymptotics in a Renewal Model with Multiple Business Lines and Heterogeneous Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic risk is receiving increasing attention in the insurance industry, as these risks can have severe impacts on the entire financial system. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional L/'{e}vy process-based renewal risk model with heterogeneous insurance claims, where every dimension indicates a business line of an insurer. We use the systemic expected shortfall (SES) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) defined with a Value-at-Risk (VaR) target level as the measurement of systemic risks. Assuming that all the claim sizes are pairwise asymptotically independent (PAI), we derive asymptotic formulas for the tail probabilities of discounted aggregate claims and total loss, which holds uniformly for all time horizons. We further obtain the asymptotics of the above systemic risk measures. The main technical issues involve the treatment of uniform convergence in the dynamic time setting. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo numerical study and verify that our asymptotics are accurate and convenient in computation.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to phase transitions in random graph isomorphism problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, with possibly different parameters, and study two isomorphism problems, a graph embedding problem and a common subgraph problem. Under certain conditions on the graph parameters we show a sharp asymptotic phase transition as the graph sizes tend to infinity. This extends known results for the case of uniform Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, naturally leading to several related problems for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Improved performance guarantees for Tukey's median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is there a natural way to order data in dimension greater than one? The approach based on the notion of data depth, often associated with the name of John Tukey, is among the most popular. Tukey's depth has found applications in robust statistics, graph theory, and the study of elections and social choice. We present improved performance guarantees for empirical Tukey's median, a deepest point associated with the given sample, when the data-generating distribution is elliptically symmetric and possibly anisotropic. Some of our results remain valid in the class of affine equivariant estimators. As a corollary of our bounds, we show that the diameter of the set of all empirical Tukey's medians scales like $o(n^{-1/2})$ where $n$ is the sample size.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inverse Problem: stability, regularization and Wasserstein gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems in physical or biological sciences often involve recovering an unknown parameter that is random. The sought-after quantity is a probability distribution of the unknown parameter, that produces data that aligns with measurements. Consequently, these problems are naturally framed as stochastic inverse problems. In this paper, we explore three aspects of this problem: direct inversion, variational formulation with regularization, and optimization via gradient flows, drawing parallels with deterministic inverse problems. A key difference from the deterministic case is the space in which we operate. Here, we work within probability space rather than Euclidean or Sobolev spaces, making tools from measure transport theory necessary for the study. Our findings reveal that the choice of metric -- both in the design of the loss function and in the optimization process -- significantly impacts the stability and properties of the optimizer.</description>

      <title>Hammerstein equations for sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a counting process to model the random occurrence in time of car traffic accidents, taking into account some aspects of the self-excitation typical of this phenomenon. By combining methods from probability and differential equations, we study this stochastic process in terms of its statistical moments and large-time trend. Moreover, we derive analytically the probability density functions of the times of occurrence of traffic accidents and of the time elapsing between two consecutive accidents. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our modelling approach by means of numerical simulations, which address also a comparison with real data of weekly trends of traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>Random large eddy simulation for 3-dimensional incompressible viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of (independent) unitary matrices. We consider both the case of an invariant random tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, called mixed, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, and which includes the random tensor models that have been extensively studied in the physics literature (we provide a short review of these results).
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined in terms of the correlations of certain invariant polynomials called trace-invariants, encoded by $D$-uplets of permutations, up to relabelling equivalence. Using the unitary invariance, we define a notion of finite free cumulants associated to the expectations of these trace-invariants, through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  In order to characterize the asymptotic distributions at first order, two important classes of random tensors are considered: pure random tensors that scale like a pure complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of free cumulants associated to the first order trace-invariants, through closed moment-cumulant formulas, which involve $D$ independent summations over non-crossing permutations. While the formulas involve the same combinatorics, the asymptotic distributions differ by the class of invariants that define the distribution at first order. Both in the pure and in the mixed case, the first order free-cumulants of a sum of two independent random tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of the higher orders is provided. Finally, tensor freeness is then defined (at first order) as the vanishing of mixed free cumulants associated to first order trace-invariants.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns a long-range random walk in random environment in dimension $1+1$, where the environmental disorder is independent in space but has long-range correlations in time. We prove that two types of rescaled partition functions converge weakly to the Stratonovich solution and the It\^o-Skorohod solution respectively of a fractional stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Gaussian noise which is white in space and colored in time.</description>

      <title>To spike or not to spike: the whims of the Wonham filter in the strong noise regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the celebrated Shiryaev-Wonham filter (1964) in its historical setup where the hidden Markov jump process has two states. We are interested in the weak noise regime for the observation equation. Interestingly, this becomes a strong noise regime for the filtering equations.
  Earlier results of the authors show the appearance of spikes in the filtered process, akin to a metastability phenomenon. This paper is aimed at understanding the smoothed optimal filter, which is relevant for any system with feedback. In particular, we exhibit a sharp phase transition between a spiking regime and a regime with perfect smoothing.</description>

Abstract: As represented by the Liouville measure, Gaussian multiplicative chaos is a random measure constructed from a Gaussian field. Under certain technical assumptions, we prove the convergence of a process time-changed by Gaussian multiplicative chaos in the case the latter object is square integrable (the $L^2$-regime). As examples of the main result, we prove that, in the whole $L^2$-regime, the scaling limit of the Liouville simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is Liouville Brownian motion and, as $\alpha \to 1$, Liouville $\alpha$-stable processes on $\mathbb{R}$ converge weakly to the Liouville Cauchy process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new general concept of surrogate random variable, the ``surrogate by exchangeability'' that allows to study the class of random variables that can be decomposed by means of an independent randomisation.
  As an example, we treat the case of the Curie-Weiss model using the explicit construction of its De Finetti measure of exchangeability. Writing the magnetisation as a sum of i.i.d.'s randomised by the underlying De Finetti random variable, the surrogate study shows that the appearance of a phase transition can be understood as a competition between these two sources of randomness, the Gaussian regime corresponding to a marginally relevant disordered system.</description>

      <title>The Extended UCB Policies for Frequentist Multi-armed Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1768</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.1768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a widely studied model in the field of operations research for sequential decision making and reinforcement learning. This paper mainly considers the classical MAB model with the heavy-tailed reward distributions. We introduce the extended robust UCB policy, which is an extension of the pioneering UCB policies proposed by Bubeck et al. [5] and Lattimore [21]. The previous UCB policies require the knowledge of an upper bound on specific moments of reward distributions or a particular moment to exist, which can be hard to acquire or guarantee in practical scenarios. Our extended robust UCB generalizes Lattimore's seminary work (for moments of orders $p=4$ and $q=2$) to arbitrarily chosen $p$ and $q$ as long as the two moments have a known controlled relationship, while still achieving the optimal regret growth order O(log T), thus providing a broadened application area of the UCB policies for the heavy-tailed reward distributions.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization for generalized rank one matrix sensing: Sharp predictions from a random initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the factors of a rank-$1$ matrix with i.i.d. Gaussian, rank-$1$ measurements that are nonlinearly transformed and corrupted by noise. Considering two prototypical choices for the nonlinearity, we study the convergence properties of a natural alternating update rule for this nonconvex optimization problem starting from a random initialization. We show sharp convergence guarantees for a sample-split version of the algorithm by deriving a deterministic recursion that is accurate even in high-dimensional problems. Notably, while the infinite-sample population update is uninformative and suggests exact recovery in a single step, the algorithm -- and our deterministic prediction -- converges geometrically fast from a random initialization. Our sharp, non-asymptotic analysis also exposes several other fine-grained properties of this problem, including how the nonlinearity and noise level affect convergence behavior.
  On a technical level, our results are enabled by showing that the empirical error recursion can be predicted by our deterministic sequence within fluctuations of the order $n^{-1/2}$ when each iteration is run with $n$ observations. Our technique leverages leave-one-out tools originating in the literature on high-dimensional $M$-estimation and provides an avenue for sharply analyzing higher-order iterative algorithms from a random initialization in other high-dimensional optimization problems with random data.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Perspective on Non-Stationary Kernels for Deeper Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a popular statistical technique for stochastic function approximation and uncertainty quantification from data. GPs have been adopted into the realm of machine learning in the last two decades because of their superior prediction abilities, especially in data-sparse scenarios, and their inherent ability to provide robust uncertainty estimates. Even so, their performance highly depends on intricate customizations of the core methodology, which often leads to dissatisfaction among practitioners when standard setups and off-the-shelf software tools are being deployed. Arguably the most important building block of a GP is the kernel function which assumes the role of a covariance operator. Stationary kernels of the Mat\'ern class are used in the vast majority of applied studies; poor prediction performance and unrealistic uncertainty quantification are often the consequences. Non-stationary kernels show improved performance but are rarely used due to their more complicated functional form and the associated effort and expertise needed to define and tune them optimally. In this perspective, we want to help ML practitioners make sense of some of the most common forms of non-stationarity for Gaussian processes. We show a variety of kernels in action using representative datasets, carefully study their properties, and compare their performances. Based on our findings, we propose a new kernel that combines some of the identified advantages of existing kernels.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian product inequality conjecture for disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends various results related to the Gaussian product inequality (GPI) conjecture to the setting of disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices. This includes product-type inequalities for matrix-variate analogs of completely monotone functions and Bernstein functions of Wishart disjoint principal minors, respectively. In particular, the product-type inequalities apply to inverse determinant powers. Quantitative versions of the inequalities are also obtained when there is a mix of positive and negative exponents. Furthermore, an extended form of the GPI is shown to hold for the eigenvalues of Wishart random matrices by virtue of their law being multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP${}_2$). A new, unexplored avenue of research is presented to study the GPI from the point of view of elliptical distributions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Markovian Arrivals and Service with Applications to Intermittent Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many important real-world queueing settings, arrival and service rates fluctuate over time. We consider the MAMS system, where the arrival and service rates each vary according to an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain, allowing intermittent overload to be modeled. This model has been extensively studied, and we derive results matching those found in the literature via a somewhat novel framework.
  We derive a characterization of mean queue length in the MAMS system, with explicit bounds for all arrival and service chains at all loads, using our new framework. Our bounds are tight in heavy traffic. We prove even stronger bounds for the important special case of two-level arrivals with intermittent overload.
  Our framework is based around the concepts of relative arrivals and relative completions, which have previously been used in studying the MAMS system, under different names. These quantities allow us to tractably capture the transient correlational effect of the arrival and service processes on the mean queue length.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order $n$ and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree $k\,(\geq 3)$, even girth $g\,(\geq 4)$, and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with applications in numerical approximations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of nonsmooth state-space models with an application to CMA-ES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a stochastic process resulting from the normalization of states in the zeroth-order optimization method CMA-ES. On a specific class of minimization problems where the objective function is scaling-invariant, this process defines a time-homogeneous Markov chain whose convergence at a geometric rate can imply the linear convergence of CMA-ES. However, the analysis of the intricate updates for this process constitute a great mathematical challenge. We establish that this Markov chain is an irreducible and aperiodic T-chain. These contributions represent a first major step for the convergence analysis towards a stationary distribution. We rely for this analysis on conditions for the irreducibility of nonsmooth state-space models on manifolds. To obtain our results, we extend these conditions to address the irreducibility in different hyperparameter settings that define different Markov chains, and to include nonsmooth state spaces.</description>
