      <title>Cone structures from a dynamical and probabilistic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>

      <title>Fractal transference principles for subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$ of positive density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a multidimensional fractal transference principle for digit-restricted sets associated with subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$, extending the one-dimensional framework of Nakajima--Takahasi, Adv. Math. (2025). We develop general Hausdorff-dimension tools via the singular value potential $\phi^s(\mathbf a)$ and the multivariate Dirichlet series $\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) =\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\prod_{j=1}^d a_j^{-\sigma_j}$. Let $s_\ast:=\inf\{s&gt;0:\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\phi^s(\mathbf a)&lt;\infty\}$ and $\Lambda_S:=\inf\{\sigma_1+\cdots+\sigma_d:\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma})&lt;\infty\}$. We obtain $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)\le s_\ast$, where $\mathcal E_S\subset(0,1)^d$ denotes the set of points whose continued-fraction digit vectors lie in $S$ and whose coordinates escape (i.e.\ $a_n(x_j)\to\infty$ for each $j$), and $s_\ast=\tfrac12\Lambda_S$ for uniformly $K$--balanced $S$. In particular, if $S\subset\mathbb{N}^d$ has positive upper (or upper Banach) density then $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)=d/2$. On the combinatorial side, the transference principle ensures that translation-invariant configurations forced at positive density, including multidimensional Szemer\'edi patterns, persist inside the induced fractal digit sets.</description>

      <title>Quantitative weak mixing for typical Salem substitution suspension flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates quantitative weak mixing of Salem substitutions flows. We prove that for a substitution whose substitution matrix is irreducible over the rationals and the dominant eigenvalue is a Salem number, for almost every suspension flow with a piecewise constant roof function, quantitative weak mixing holds with a rate that is slightly worse than a power of $\log\log$. We do not know if this is sharp, but we do show that for any suspension flow of this kind, quantitative weak mixing with a polynomial rate is impossible. Results for specific systems are often much weaker than for ``typical'' or ``generic'' ones. In the Appendix we explain how a minor modification of an argument from Bufetov and Solomyak (2014) yields very weak, but nevertheless quantitative weak mixing estimates of $\log^*$ type for the {\em self-similar} suspension flow over a Salem substitution. Simultaneously this provides first quantitative decay rates for the Fourier transform of Salem Bernoulli convolutions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the Suris' potential in the Frenkel-Kontorova Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to establish a local rigidity result for the integrability of standard-like maps. The main focus of the paper is the remarkable integrable potential discovered by Suris in the 80's. We show that locally, the integrability of this potential is rigid. The proof relies on a similar strategy that was used for billiards in an ellipse, and involves developing the action-angle coordinates for this system, and exploiting it to construct a Riesz basis for $L^2$. As a corollary, we obtain a spectral rigidity result for this setting. Finally, we study the integrability question in the setting of potentials that are periodic.</description>

      <title>Brjuno-Like Functions for nonlinear expanding maps: Fractional Derivatives and Regularity Dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohomological equations appear frequently in dynamical systems. One of the most classical examples is the Liv\v{s}ic equation $$ v(x) = \alpha \circ F(x) - \alpha(x).$$ The existence and regularity of its solutions $\alpha$ is well understood when $F$ is a hyperbolic dynamical system (for instance an expanding map of the circle) and $v$ is a H\"older function.
  The $\textbf{twisted cohomological equation}$ $$ v(x) = \alpha \circ F(x) - (DF(x))^\beta \, \alpha(x) $$ is much less well understood. Functions similar to the famous Brjuno, Weierstrass, and Takagi functions appear as solutions of this equation. This functional equation also appears in the work of M. Lyubich, and of Avila, Lyubich, and de Melo in their study of deformations of quadratic-like and real-analytic maps.
  Nevertheless, there are some striking results concerning the (lack of) regularity of solutions $\alpha$ when $F$ is a linear endomorphism of the circle and $v$ is very regular. Notable contributions include works by Berry and Lewis; Ledrappier; Przytycki and Urba\'nski, and more recently by Bara\'nski, B\'ar\'any and Romanowska, as well as by Shen, and by Ren and Shen, on Takagi and Weierstrass (and Weierstrass-like) functions.
  We study the regularity of solutions $\alpha$ when $F$ is a $\textbf{nonlinear}$ expanding map of the circle and $v$ is not differentiable or even continuous, a setting in which previously used transversality techniques do not appear to be applicable. The new approach uses fractional derivatives to reduce the study of the twisted cohomological equation to that of a corresponding Liv\v{s}ic cohomological equation, and to show that the resulting distributional solutions (in the sense of Schwartz) satisfy certain Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of self-maps in their primal topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a series of dynamical concepts for self-maps in the primal topology induced by them. Among the concepts studied are non-wandering points, limit points, recurrent points, minimal sets, transitive points and self-maps, topologically ergodic self-maps, weakly mixing self-maps, strongly mixing self-maps, Lyapunov stable self-maps, chaotic self-maps in the sense of Auslander-Yorke, chaotic self-maps in the sense of Devaney, asymptotic pairs, proximal pairs, and syndetically proximal pairs.
  Some results are given in the more general context of continuous self-maps in an Alexandroff topological space. We prove that a continuous self-map of an Alexandroff space is always Lyapunov stable.</description>

      <title>Quasi-visual approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the foundations of the theory of quasi-visual approximations of bounded metric spaces. Roughly speaking, these are sequences of covers of a given space for which the diameters of the sets in the covers shrink to zero and for which relative metric quantities (such as ratios of diameters and distances) are uniformly controlled. This framework has applications to questions in quasiconformal geometry. In particular, quasi-visual approximations can be used to detect whether a given homeomorphism between two bounded metric spaces is a quasisymmetry.
  We also explore the connection to the theory of Gromov hyperbolic spaces via the tile graph associated with a quasi-visual approximation. As an application, we relate these ideas to the dynamics of semi-hyperbolic rational maps. More specifically, we show that the Julia set of a rational map admits a dynamical quasi-visual approximation if and only if the map is semi-hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Global solution curves in harmonic parameters, and multiplicity of solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \[ \Delta u+g(u)=f(x) \s \mbox{for $x \in \Omega$}, \s u=0 \s \mbox{on $\partial \Omega$} \] decompose $f(x)=\mu _1 \p _1+e(x)$, where $\p _1$ is the principal eigenfunction of the Laplacian with zero boundary conditions, and $e(x) \perp \p _1$ in $L^2(\Omega)$, and similarly write $u(x)= \xi _1 \p _i+U (x)$, with $ U \perp \p _1$ in $L^2(\Omega)$. We study properties of the solution curve $(u(x),\mu _1)(\xi _1)$, and in particular its section $\mu _1=\mu _1(\xi _1)$, which governs the multiplicity of solutions. We consider both general nonlinearities, and some important classes of equations, and obtain detailed description of solution curves under the assumption $g'(u)&lt;\la _2$. We obtain particularly detailed results in case of one dimension. This approach is well suited for numerical computations, which we perform to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>A Real-Space Formulation of the Zak Phase via Weyl m-Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new, real-space formula for the Zak phase for one dimensional periodic Jacobi operators in terms of the Weyl $m_+$-function that does not rely on Floquet-Bloch theory. This novel representation highlights the dependence of the Zak phase on boundary terms. Moreover, we show how to recover the classical quantisation of the Zak phase for periodic Jacobi operators with inversion symmetric fundamental cells.</description>

      <title>Fractional Diffusion on Graphs: Superposition of Laplacian Semigroups and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subdiffusion on graphs is often modeled by time-fractional diffusion equations, yet its structural and dynamical consequences remain unclear. We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the birth of heterodimensional cycles from a generic homoclinic tangency to a hyperbolic periodic orbit. We prove for $C^r$ ($r=3,\dots,\infty,\omega$) dynamical systems on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$, with $\dim \mathcal{M}\geqslant 3$ for diffeomorphisms and with $\dim \mathcal{M}\geqslant 4$ for flows, that $C^1$-robust heterodimensional dynamics of coindex one appear in any generic two-parameter $C^r$ unfolding of a homoclinic tangency to a periodic orbit such that at least one central multiplier is not real and the central dynamics are not sectionally dissipative. The heterodimensional dynamics also involve a blender exhibiting $C^1$-robust homoclinic tangencies. As a corollary, any system with a homoclinic tangency of the class described above belongs to the $C^r$ closure of the $C^1$-open Newhouse domain.</description>

We establish the analyticity of the maximal Lyapunov exponent as a function of the transition probabilities, thus extending the results and methods of Y.

      <title>Computation of attractor dimension and maximal sums of Lyapunov exponents using polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two approaches are presented for computing upper bounds on Lyapunov exponents and their sums, and on the Lyapunov dimension, among all trajectories of a dynamical system governed by ordinary differential equations. The first approach expresses a sum of Lyapunov exponents as a time average in an augmented dynamical system and then applies methods for bounding time averages. This generalizes the method of Oeri \&amp; Goluskin (Nonlinearity 36:5378--5400, 2023) for bounding the single largest Lyapunov exponent. The second approach considers a different augmented dynamical system, where bounds on sums of Lyapunov exponents are implied by stability of certain sets, and such stability is verified using Lyapunov function methods. Both of our approaches also can be adapted to directly compute bounds on Lyapunov dimension, which in turn imply bounds on the fractal dimension of a global attractor. For systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides, all of our bounding formulations lead to polynomial optimization problems with sum-of-squares constraints. These sum-of-squares problems can be solved computationally for a chosen system to yield numerical bounds, provided the number of variables and degree of polynomials are not prohibitive. Most of our bounding formulations are proved to be sharp under mild assumptions. In the case of the polynomial optimization problems, sharpness means that upper bounds converge to the quantities being bounded as polynomial degrees are raised. Computational examples demonstrate upper bounds that are sharp to several digits, including for a six-dimensional dynamical system where sums of Lyapunov exponents are maximized on periodic orbits.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a family of parametrized nonhomogeneous linear complex differential equations on $[1,\infty)$, depending on a complex parameter lying in the critical strip. We identify a "suitable" rigidity hypothesis under which a phenomenon of structural asymmetry is established: if two solutions with the same initial condition equal to $1$, corresponding respectively to the parameters $s$ and $1-\bar{s}$, are both bounded on $[1,+\infty)$, then $\Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flows on 3D contact sub-Riemannian manifolds via the Rumin complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the appropriate notion of magnetic field on three-dimensional contact sub-Riemannian manifolds is given by a closed Rumin differential two-form. We introduce horizontal magnetic flows starting from magnetic potential one-forms, proving that the flow depends only on the Rumin differential of the potential. Notably, in dimension three the Rumin differential acts on one-forms as a second-order differential operator.
  We further prove that such magnetic flows can be interpreted as a geodesic flow on a suitably lifted sub-Riemannian structure, which is of Engel type when the magnetic field is non-vanishing. In the general case, when the magnetic field may vanish, we analyze the geometry of the lifted structure, characterizing its step and abnormal trajectories in terms of the analytical properties of the magnetic field.
  Our work is inspired by the classical correspondence, first observed by Montgomery, between Riemannian magnetic flows and sub-Riemannian geometry.</description>
