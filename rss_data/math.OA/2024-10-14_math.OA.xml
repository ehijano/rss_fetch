      <title>Perfect Quantum Approximate Strategies for Imitation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an imitation game has a perfect quantum approximate strategy if and only if there exists a bi-tracial state on the minimal tensor product of two universal C${^*}$-algebras, which induces the perfect correlation. Moreover, we are trying to relate imitation games to the minimal tensor product of two universal C${^*}$-algebras and demonstrate that an imitation game has a perfect quantum approximate strategy if and only if there exist a von Neumann algebra and an amenable tracial state on it, such that the perfect correlation can be induced by the tracial state. However, We encountered some difficulties regarding continuity in the proof process. In section 2 we get some results for special cases, and in section 3 we list our problems.</description>

      <title>Transfer of quantum game strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for the transfer of perfect strategies between various classes of two-player, one round cooperative non-local games with quantum inputs and outputs using the simulation paradigm in quantum information theory. We show that such a transfer is possible when canonically associated operator spaces for each game are quantum homomorphic or isomorphic, as defined in the joint work of H. and Todorov (2024). We examine a new class of QNS correlations, needed for the transfer of strategies between games, and characterize them in terms of states on tensor products of canonical operator systems. We define jointly tracial correlations and show they correspond to traces acting on tensor products of canonical ${\rm C}^{*}$-algebras associated with individual game parties. We then make an inquiry into the initial application of such results to the study of concurrent quantum games.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-modules, $L^p$-correspondences, and their $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an $L^p$-operator algebraic analogue of Hilbert C*-modules. We initiate the theory of concrete $L^p$-modules, their morphisms, and basic constructions such as countable direct sums and tensor products. We then define $L^p$-correspondences together with their Fock representations and the $L^p$-operator algebras generated by these. We present evidence that well-known $L^p$-operator algebras can be constructed from $L^p$-correspondences via covariant Fock representations. In particular, for $p \in (1,\infty)$ and $q$ its H\"older conjugate, we show that the $L^p$-module $(\ell_d^p, \ell_d^q)$ gives rise to an $L^p$-correspondence over $\Bbb{C}$ whose $L^p$-operator algebra is isometrically isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_d^p$, the $L^p$-analogue of the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_d$ introduced by N.C. Phillips in 2012. As a second example, we fix a nondegenerate $L^p$-operator algebra $A$ with a bicontractive approximate identity together with an isometric automorphism $\varphi_A \in \mathrm{Aut}(A)$. We then show that there is a contractive map from the crossed product $F^p(\Bbb{Z}, A, \varphi_A)$ to the $L^p$-operator algebra generated by the covariant Fock representation of the $L^p$-correspondence $(A, A, \varphi_A)$.</description>

      <title>Left regular representations of Garside categories II. Finiteness properties of topological full groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.04505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological full groups attached to groupoid models for left regular representations of Garside categories. Groups arising in this way include Thompson's group $V$ and many of its variations such as R\"over-Nekrashevych groups. Our key observation is that a Garside structure for the underlying small category induces a new Garside structure for a new small category of bisections, and that our topological full group coincides with the fundamental group of the enveloping groupoid of the new category. As a consequence, we solve the word problem and identify general criteria for establishing finiteness properties of our topological full groups. In particular, we show that topological full groups arising from products of shifts of finite type are of type ${\rm F}_{\infty}$, answering a natural question left open by Matui.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{C}^*$-exactness and property A for group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an action of a discrete group $\Gamma$ on a set $X$, we show that the Schreier graph on $X$ has property A if and only if the permutation representation on $\ell_2X$ generates an exact $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra. This is well known in the case of the left regular action on $X=\Gamma$ as the equivalence of $\mathrm{C}^*$-exactness and property A of its Cayley graph. This also generalizes Sako's theorem, which states that exactness of the uniform Roe algebra $\mathrm{C}^*_{\mathrm{u}}(X)$ characterizes property A of $X$ when $X$ is uniformly locally finite.</description>

      <title>The exact quantum chromatic number of Hadamard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the exact value of the quantum chromatic numbers of Hadamard graphs of order $n=2^N$ for $N$ a multiple of $4$ using the upper bound derived by Avis, Hasegawa, Kikuchi, and Sasaki, as well as an application of the Hoffman-like lower bound of Elphick and Wocjan that was generalized by Ganesan for quantum graphs. As opposed to prior computations for the lower bound, our approach uses Ito's results on conjugacy class graphs allowing us to also find bounds on the quantum chromatic numbers of products of Hadamard graphs. In particular, we also compute the exact quantum chromatic number of the categorical product of Hadamard graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular numbers of operators between Hilbert spaces were generalized to Banach spaces by s-numbers (in the sense of Pietsch). This allows for different choices, including approximation, Gelfand, Kolmogorov and Bernstein numbers. Here, we present an elementary proof of a bound between the smallest and the largest s-number.</description>
