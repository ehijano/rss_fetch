      <title>Tunneling in a Lorenz-like model for an active wave-particle entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering the setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>

      <title>The General Three-Body Problem in Conformal-Euclidean Space: Hidden Symmetries and New Properties of a Low-Dimensional Syste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the huge number of research into the three-body problem in physics and mathematics, the study of this problem still remains relevant both from the point of view of its broad application and taking into account its fundamental significance for the theory of dynamical systems. In addition, to solve the problem of quantum-to-classical transition, it is important to answer the question: is irreversibility fundamental to the description of the classical world? To answer this question, we considered a reference classical dynamical system, the general three-body problem, formulating it in conformal Euclidean space and rigorously proving its equivalence to the Newtonian three-body problem. It is shown that a curved configuration space with a local coordinate system reveals new hidden symmetries of the internal motion of a dynamical system, which makes it possible to reduce the problem to a 6th order system instead of the known 8th order. The most important consequence of this consideration is that the chronologizing parameter of the motion of a system of particles, which we call internal time, is in the general case irreversible, which is characteristic of the general three-body problem. An equation is derived that describes the evolution of the flow of geodesic trajectories, with the help of which the entropy of the system is constructed. New criteria for assessing the complexity of a low-dimensional dynamic system and the dimension of stochastic fractal structures arising in three-dimensional space are obtained. An effective mathematical algorithm has been developed for the numerical simulation of the general three-body problem, which is traditionally a difficult-to-solve system of stiff ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations with their corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations, neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale linear equations and high dimension have been hot topics in deep learning, machine learning, control,and scientific computing. Because of special conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural dynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on real field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis. Con-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex matrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more elements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of coefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj model is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model effectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-based schemes for on-the-fly parameter estimation in dissipative dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies two particular algorithms, a Relaxation Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and a Relaxation Newton Iteration (RNI) scheme , for reconstructing unknown parameters in dissipative dynamical systems. Both algorithms are based on a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm for state reconstruction of A. Azouani, E. Olson, and E.S. Titi \cite{Azouani_Olson_Titi_2014}. Due to the CDA origins of these parameter recovery algorithms, these schemes provide on-the-fly reconstruction, that is, as data is collected, of unknown state and parameters simultaneously. It is shown how both algorithms give way to a robust general framework for simultaneous state and parameter estimation. In particular, we develop a general theory, applicable to a large class of dissipative dynamical systems, which identifies structural and algorithmic conditions under which the proposed algorithms achieve reconstruction of the true parameters. The algorithms are implemented on a high-dimensional two-layer Lorenz 96 model, where the theoretical conditions of the general framework are explicitly verifiable. They are also implemented on the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms beyond the finite-dimensional setting. In each case, systematic numerical experiments are carried out probing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, in addition to the apparent benefits and drawbacks between them.</description>

      <title>Online regularization of Poincar\'e map of storage rings with Shannon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shannon Entropy is adopted to quantify the chaos of measured Poincar\'e maps in the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) storage ring. The recurrent Poincar\'e maps, constructed from beam position monitor's turn-by-turn readings, are commonly used to observe the nonlinearity in ring-based accelerators. However, these observations typically only provide a qualitative observation. With some canonical transformations on Poincar\'e maps, not only can the commonly used nonlinear characterizations be extracted, but more importantly, the chaos can be quantitatively measured with entropy. Entropy, therefore as a chaos indicator, is used for online Poincar\'e map regularization and dynamic aperture optimization in the NSLS-II ring.</description>
