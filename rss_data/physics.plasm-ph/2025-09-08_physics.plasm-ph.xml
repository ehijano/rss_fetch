      <title>Perpendicular ion heating in turbulence and reconnection: magnetic moment breaking by coherent fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of an ion with a fluctuation in the electromagnetic fields that is localized in both space and time. We study the scale-dependence of the interaction in both space and time, deriving a generic form for the ion's energy change, which involves an exponential cutoff based on the characteristic timescale of the electromagnetic fluctuation. This leads to diffusion in energy in both $v_\perp$ and $v_\parallel$. We show how to apply our results to general plasma physics phenomena, and specifically to Alfv\'enic turbulence and to reconnection. Our theory can be viewed as a unification of previous models of stochastic ion heating, cyclotron heating, and reconnection heating in a single theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Energy partitioning in electrostatic discharge with variable series load resistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation into the energy partitioning of quasi-static electrostatic discharge (ESD) events in air, a scenario in which the discharge occurs across a fixed gap. We systematically characterize the energy transferred to a series victim load across a broad range of resistances (0.1 to 10,000Ohm) and circuit parameters, including capacitance and gap length. Our results show that the fraction of stored energy delivered to the victim load is largely independent of gap length. We demonstrate that the classic Rompe-Weizel spark resistance model effectively predicts the scaling of this energy transfer, establishing a clear link between spark resistance and energy partitioning. These findings provide a valuable, predictive framework for guiding safety requirements for sensitive electronic components and energetic materials and will inform the development of more accurate circuit models for ESD events.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fourier Neural Operator-Plasma Fluid Model for Fast and Accurate Multiscale Simulations of High Power Microwave Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver. Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Resonance density range of absolute two-plasmon decay instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new insight into absolute two-plasmon decay (TPD) instability in nonuniform plasmas by identifying the resonance density range as the key parameter governing the growth of the resonant absolute modes. This range is defined as the density interval within which these resonant modes still exhibit growth in homogeneous plasmas. This range properly characterizes the spatial growth region of the resonant absolute modes in a series of linear fluid simulations across broad parameter spaces. Building on this insight, we investigate the absolute growth of TPD modes driven by laser pulses with intensity modulations, a common feature in broadband lasers used to suppress laser plasma instabilities. We establish the relationship between the resonance density range and the threshold time interval between intensity peaks, beyond which absolute growth is suppressed.</description>

      <title>Time-Embedded Convolutional Neural Networks for Modeling Plasma Heat Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a time-embedded convolutional neural network (TCNN) for modeling spatiotemporal heat transport in plasmas, particularly under strongly nonlocal conditions. In our earlier work, the LMV-Informed Neural Network (LINN) (Luo et al., arXiv:2506.16619) combined prior knowledge from the LMV model with kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) data to improve kernel-based heat-flux predictions. While effective under moderately nonlocal conditions, LINN produced physically inconsistent kernels in strongly time-dependent regimes due to its reliance on the quasi-stationary LMV formulation. To overcome this limitation, TCNN is designed to capture the coupled evolution of both the normalized heat flux and the characteristic nonlocality parameter using a unified neural architecture informed by underlying physical principles. Trained on fully kinetic PIC simulations, TCNN accurately reproduces nonlocal dynamics across a broad range of collisionalities. Our results demonstrate that the combination of time modulation, coupled prediction, and convolutional depth significantly enhances predictive performance, offering a data-driven yet physically consistent framework for multiscale plasma transport problems.</description>

      <title>Complete reflection of nonlinear electromagnetic waves in underdense pair plasmas enabled by dynamically formed Bragg-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using kinetic simulations and theory, we show that nonlinear electromagnetic waves can make even strongly underdense pair plasmas fully reflective. As the wave compresses and accelerates the plasma, weak reflection seeds a periodic train of density spikes that grow rapidly due to mass symmetry. This moving Bragg-like grating increases reflection and momentum transfer, enabling a transition to a regime where the relativistic plasma-vacuum interface sustains complete reflection. Finite temperature raises the full-reflection density threshold, yet the corresponding density can remain underdense.</description>

      <title>Effect of superthermal electrons on the Quantum electron acoustic double layers in dense astrophysical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron acoustic double layers (EADLs) have been investigated in four component unmagnetized dense quantum plasmas consisting of stationary background ions and two electron populations, cold and hot, with the superthermal kappa distributed electrons. Using the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model and the reductive perturbation technique, a generalized Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation was derived, and stationary analytical solutions were obtained. The analysis revealed that superthermal electrons substantially influence the amplitude, width, and polarity of EADLs. Numerical results indicated that decreasing the spectral index kappa or increasing the relative density of kappa electrons to hot electrons intensifies nonlinear effects, producing stronger compressive and rarefactive structures. It is also found that kappa plays a more dominant role than the density ratio in controlling EADL properties in dense astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: A hybrid model where ions are treated as particles and electrons with fluid equations for magnetized electron flux is adapted in order to simulate a vacuum arc source. This source is a candidate for solid propellant propulsion system of micro- and nano-satellites. We show preliminary results of the plume and interelectrode region properties with and without the influence of an imposed magnetic field. We compare the results with experimental data, and we find that the magnetic collimation is overestimated in the simulation</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination of NeH+ with low-energy electrons: Multichannel quantum defect theory including non-adiabatic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical investigation of the dissociative recombination (DR) of NeH+ with low-energy electrons in the regime where the process occurs without direct potential energy curve crossings is presented. The calculations are performed using multichannel quantum defect theory, incorporating non-adiabatic couplings between electronic states. Unlike the previous treatment of the DR of HeH+, where only first-order radial couplings A(R) were considered, our formulation also incorporates the second-order terms B(R), together with a radial density of states \b{eta}{\nu} (R) to describe the transition into the ionization continuum. This development uses a large number of potential energy curves and non-adiabatic couplings of NeH characterized by us previously, enabling a consistent modeling of the DR process. The resulting cross sections show good agreement with the available experimental data and fill a gap in theoretical data below 4.5 eV, where no detailed quantum calculations are currently available.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration up to the synchrotron burn-off limit in relativistic magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on understanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To progress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas including synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle energy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond with a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles cool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\sigma \approx 1 $ and amplitude $\delta B/B_0\simeq 1$), the particle distribution follows ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}\gamma\propto \gamma^{-s}$ with $s\simeq 3$ below the predicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\simeq 4$ above. The particle distribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability near the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy turn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the acceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose maximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are accelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by a gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of relativistic amplitude, $\delta u_E \gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable to the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the Crab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors similar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this environment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.

      <title>Thermal Radiation Exchange between Nanoparticles Heated by Arc Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heating of particles by plasma radiation plays a critical role in space science involving dusty plasma as well as in industrial processes such as plasma vapor deposition, microchip production, etching and plasma fusion. Numerical modeling of radiation heat transfer from plasma to nano-scale particles includes exchange of scattered thermal radiation between particles-an effect that was neglected in prior studies in which temperature of particles was estimated. Thermal modeling of gas loaded with nanoparticles differs from a typical multiphase flow, where particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas. In contrast, the temperature of nanoparticles heated by radiation is significantly higher than the local gas temperature. The nanoparticles volume heating by radiation is markedly different from conventional surface heating experience by macroscale particles. The larger particles are heated to higher temperatures than smaller ones. The study includes numerical modeling of thermal radiation scattered by particles in the Rayleigh regime in where particles radii are much smaller compared to the radiation wavelength and the distance between particles is larger than the dominant radiation wavelength. The study investigates the effects of reduction in conduction heat flux by reducing the gas pressure and using alternating noble gases. Additionally, it investigates the role of enhancement of radiation heat flux from the arc. The computational results show that the re-radiation by larger, heated nanoparticles is important to obtain the accurate temperature of particles. This inter-particle thermal interaction leads to higher temperatures in smaller particles than models assuming thermally isolated particles would predict.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Issues of tokamak power plants, such as maximum possible length of a pulse of fusion power and the evolution of the current profile towards disruptive states, are tightly constrained by the evolution equation for the magnetic field. This equation follows from Faraday's Law and the purely mathematical relation between the magnetic and the electric fields. The validity of detailed simulations is tested by consistency with Faraday's Law, not the other way around. The high sensitivity of tokamaks to variations in the radial profile of the loop voltage make them disruption prone on a shorter timescale than the time that they can be maintained by a solenoid. The frequency of disruptions and the temporal decay of $n\tau_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments show the importance of careful profile control. Feasible computational simulations from startup to shutdown for prototype plasmas could greatly clarify these constraints and the feasibility of their avoidance. Clarification could also be obtained by operating existing experiments in a way that simulates power-plant constraints. This paper has two purposes: (1) Illustrate issues on which research should be focused for the credibility tokamak power plants. (2) Encourage thought on the allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results from C. Paz-Soldan et al 2024 Nucl. Fusion 64 094002 demonstrate encouraging energy confinement properties for the negative triangularity scenario, similar to or exceeding the scaling of the IPB98(y,2) law. This work describes the procedure with which a new scaling law was regressed specifically from the data from the aforementioned article. Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, kernel density estimation was employed to minimize sampling bias and bootstrapping was used to give a realistic estimate of the large uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as compared to the H-mode scaling law.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein's equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during inspiral, merger and ring-down of a binary black hole collision.</description>
