      <title>Broadband mode exchanger based on subwavelength Y-junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode silicon photonics, leveraging mode-division multiplexing technologies, offers significant potential to increase capacity of large-scale multiprocessing systems for on-chip optical interconnects. These technologies have implications not only for telecom and datacom applications, but also for cutting-edge fields such as quantum and nonlinear photonics. Thus, the development of compact, low-loss and low-crosstalk multimode devices, in particular mode exchangers, is crucial for effective on-chip mode manipulation. This work introduces a novel mode exchanger that exploits the properties of subwavelength grating metamaterials and symmetric Y-junctions, achieving low losses and crosstalk over a broad bandwidth and a compact size of only 6.5 {\mu}m {\times} 2.6 {\mu}m. The integration of SWG nanostructures in our design enables precise control of mode exchange through different propagation constants in the arms and metamaterial, and takes advantage of dispersion engineering to broaden the operating bandwidth. Experimental characterization demonstrates, to the best of our knowledge, the broadest operational bandwidth covering from 1420 nm to 1620 nm, with measured losses as low as 0.5 dB and extinction ratios higher than 10 dB. Enhanced performance is achieved within a 149 nm bandwidth (1471-1620 nm), showing measured losses below 0.4 dB and extinction ratios greater than 18 dB.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Polarimetric Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric imaging, a technique that captures the invisible polarization-related properties of given materials, has broad applications from fundamental physics to advanced fields such as target recognition, stress detection, biomedical diagnosis and remote sensing. The introduction of quantum sources into classical imaging systems has demonstrated distinct advantages, yet few studies have explored their combination with polarimetric imaging. In this study, we present a quantum polarimetric imaging system that integrates polarization-entangled photon pairs into a polarizer-sample-compensator-analyzer (PSRA)-type polarimeter. Our system visualizes the birefringence properties of a periodical-distributed anisotropic material under decreasing illumination levels and diverse disturbing light sources. Compared to the classical system, the quantum approach reveals the superior sensitivity and robustness in low-light conditions, particularly useful in biomedical studies where the low illumination and non-destructive detection are urgently needed. The study also highlights the nonlocality of entangled photons in birefringence measurement, indicating the potential of quantum polarimetric system in the remote sensing domain.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: revisiting with experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish the model that links the absorption and scattering coefficients of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of thin-film composite, supported by well-controlled experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. The absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are calculated from the measured transmittance and reflectance using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction. From the theoretical side, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the accumulation of absorption and scattering of individual particles, which are derived from the Mie theory. The agreement between the $K$ and $S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and from theoretical calculations gives deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. Furthermore, the validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain the preliminary results for materials designed toward radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>Field of View Expansion for Resonant Beam Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) leverages lightwave as the wireless transmission medium, emerging as a promising technology in the future Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. The use of retro-reflectors in constructing spatially separated laser resonators (SSLR) enables a self-aligning wireless transmission system with the self-reproducing resonant beam, i.e. resonant beam system (RBS). However, it's effective Field of View (FoV) is physically limited by the size of retroreflectors and still requires significant improvement. This restricts the transmitter from providing seamless wireless connectivity and power supply to receivers within a large dynamic movement range. In this paper, we propose an FoV-enlarged resonant beam system operating at a meter distance by incorporating a telescope. The telescope plays a crucial role in minimizing the extra loss inflicted on the gain medium, which typically arises from the deviation of the resonant beam within the cavity. Further, we construct the proposed telescope-based RBS and experimentally demonstrate that the design could expand the FoV to 28$^\circ$ over 1 m transmission distance is about triple that of the ordinary RBS design.</description>

      <title>Analysis of defect modes in one-dimensional photonic crystals with two defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, analytical expressions for determination of the wavelength of defect modes (DMs) in one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystals (PCs) with two defect layers (DLs) were obtained from the condition of zero reflection. Analytical formulas on the conditions for the merging of two DMs and on the DMs with zero value of the reflection coefficient were obtained. Different typical 1D PC structures with two DLs were considered and compared, including their DMs behavior. The distribution of electromagnetic field within the first photonic bandgap (PBG) was analyzed for several cases of DM merging and for the different orders of DMs. The results of this research permit the simplification of the analysis of optical sensors and filters based on 1D PCs with two DLs, as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the DM behavior within the PBGs of such PC structures. Furthermore, this paper helps to explain the results obtained by other researchers earlier in this field, too.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a Displaced Coaxial Feed for Cascaded Cylindrical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes a realistic feed for cylindrical metasurfaces, allowing it to be included in metasurface design. Specifically, it investigates a coaxial feed which is displaced from the center (off-center) of concentrically-cascaded cylindrical metasurfaces. Formulas are reported to quickly compute the multimodal S-matrix (scattering properties) of a displaced feed from that of the central feed. The theory is rigorously derived based on the addition theorem of Hankel functions for all azimuthal modes. Moreover, the resulting multimodal S-matrix is combined with the multimodal wave matrix theory used to model cylindrical metasurfaces, allowing devices to be designed that realize arbitrary field transformations from a displaced coaxial feed. A design example is reported, which opens new opportunities in the realization of realistic, high-performance cylindrical-metasurface-based devices.</description>

      <title>Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. Due to the unconventional nature of vdW ferroelectricity, these topological polar structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here we propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are anti-parallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for the experimental detection of topological polarization structures.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Test of Compact, Distributed-Charge, X-Band Accelerator Systems that Enable Image-Guided, VHEE FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10 {\mu}A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical" footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual micro-bunches per RF pulse enables &gt; 10 nC of charge to be produced in a macrobunch of &lt; 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.</description>

      <title>Coherent nonlinear Thomson scattering of Laguerre-Gauss beams on an electron sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the scattering of a monochromatic helical laser beam, described by a Laguerre-Gauss solution of the Maxwell equations, on an electron sheet, initially at rest in the focal plane of the laser; the interaction is described in the framework of a local plane wave approximation. We calculate the scattered electromagnetic field observed in an arbitrary point at a large distance from the laser focal spot, by adding coherently the contributions of each electron in the electron sheet. Due to the interference effects, the radiation is emitted only into the forward direction, within a narrow cone, and it has a spatial structure that we analyze theoretically and numerically. For circularly polarized incident fields, the structure is also helical, with a helical index which depends on the helical index of the incident radiation and the harmonic order. These structures can be observed experimentally, as each harmonic order is emitted with a different frequency, and within cones of different opening angles. Our findings are in agreement with experimental results in the literature which demonstrate the generation of OAM carrying photons by radiation scattering on electrons.</description>

      <title>Impact of E-plane Misalignment on THz Diagonal Horn Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in developing terahertz front-ends is achieving high coupling efficiency between the waveguide feed horn and the optical beam. In this paper, we have quantified the alignment requirements for the widely used E-plane split diagonal horn antenna through theoretical analysis, electromagnetic simulation, and experimental validation within the 325-500 GHz frequency range. The results from our analytical models, simulations, and measurements are consistent and shows good agreement. They reveal that even minor geometric asymmetries can cause significant increases in fractional power radiated to the cross-polar component due to amplitude and phase imbalances in the TE10 and TE01 modes. Furthermore, a misalignment of approximately 8% of the wavelength was observed to result in a 3-dB degradation in the optical coupling to a Gaussian beam (Gaussicity) in middle of the waveguide band. These findings highlight the critical importance of precise alignment and feed horn machining for the successful implementation of terahertz front-end systems.</description>
