      <title>The evolution of systems biology and systems medicine: From mechanistic models to uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of interactions within cells, tissues, and organisms is crucial to driving developments across biology and medicine. Mathematical modeling is an essential tool for simulating biological systems and revealing biochemical regulatory mechanisms. Building on experiments, mechanistic models are widely used to describe small-scale intracellular networks and uncover biochemical mechanisms in healthy and diseased states. The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing techniques and computational tools has recently enabled models that span multiple scales, often integrating signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic networks. These multiscale models enable comprehensive investigations of cellular networks and thus reveal previously unknown disease mechanisms and pharmacological interventions. Here, we review systems biology models from classical mechanistic models to larger, multiscale models that integrate multiple layers of cellular networks. We introduce several examples of models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exercise, and cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, we discuss methods that increase the certainty and accuracy of model predictions. Integrating multiscale models has become a powerful tool for understanding disease and inspiring drug discoveries by incorporating omics data within the cell and across tissues and organisms.</description>

      <title>Boolean matrix logic programming for active learning of gene functions in genome-scale metabolic network models</title>

Abstract: Techniques to autonomously drive research have been prominent in Computational Scientific Discovery, while Synthetic Biology is a field of science that focuses on designing and constructing new biological systems for useful purposes. Here we seek to apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery. Comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) are often used to evaluate cellular engineering strategies to optimise target compound production. However, predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs, often due to errors in the models. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>
