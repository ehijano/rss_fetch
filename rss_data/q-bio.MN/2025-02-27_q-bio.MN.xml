      <title>A Mathematical Model of the Cell Cycle: Exploring the Impact of Zingerone on Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model that explores the interactions between Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) and the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) in cancer cells. Through the analysis of a dynamical system simulating the CDK1-APC network, we investigate the system's behavior and its implications for cancer progression and potential therapeutic interventions. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDK1-APC interactions in regulating the cell cycle and examine the impact of Zingerone, a compound derived from ginger, on modulating the period of the oscillatory dynamics. These results provide new insights into the potential of Zingerone to influence cell proliferation and offer avenues for less harmful cancer treatments. The quantitative analysis is conducted by first theoretically deriving the cell viability as a function of time and Zingerone concentration, and then validating this function by using experimental data.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</description>

      <title>Modelling Chemical Reaction Networks using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chemical reaction network theory, ordinary differential equations are used to model the temporal change of chemical species concentration. As the functional form of these ordinary differential equations systems is derived from an empirical model of the reaction network, it may be incomplete. Our approach aims to elucidate these hidden insights in the reaction network by combining dynamic modelling with deep learning in the form of neural ordinary differential equations. Our contributions not only help to identify the shortcomings of existing empirical models but also assist the design of future reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as "cells" that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the basic RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences, each motivated by methods from previous work related to stochastic reaction networks. We provide several numerical examples comparing the various methods in the new setting. We find that the relative performance of each method is in line with its analog in the "standard" stochastic reaction network setting. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>
