      <title>Perspectives on the Physics of Late-Type Stars from Beyond Low Earth Orbit, the Moon and Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the new discoveries enabled thanks to the recent space missions, stellar physics is going through a revolution. However, these discoveries opened the door to many new questions that require more observations. The European Space Agency's Human and Robotic Exploration programme provides an excellent opportunity to push forward the limits of our knowledge and better understand stellar structure and dynamics evolution. Long-term observations, Ultra-Violet observations, and a stellar imager are a few highlights of proposed missions for late-type stars that will enhance the already planned space missions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Helical Plasma Turbulence on the Diffusive $\beta$ Effect with Increasing Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for plasma systems with increasing Reynolds numbers while maintaining a unit magnetic Prandtl number. For $\alpha$semi and $\beta$semi, we used large-scale magnetic data. Additionally, we calculated $\beta$theo using turbulent kinetic data. We reproduced large-scale magnetic fields, B, for each case and compared them with the simulation data. The results show that the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and B in each case are consistent with other approaches, particularly simulation results, as long as the nonlinear effects are not too strong. This indicates that magnetic effects need to be incorporated when nonlinearity becomes significant. Nonetheless, the consistent results between B and turbulent plasma motion suggest a theoretically sound approach. On the other hand, to explain the physical meanings of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we introduced a field structure model. Although simple, this model effectively clarifies the roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, representing the electrodynamic induction effect and the fluid-like diffusion effect, respectively. The agreement between our method and direct numerical simulations, along with the physical interpretations, indicates that the complex interaction processes between turbulent plasma and magnetic fields can be analyzed using fundamental and conservative physical quantities. Furthermore, $\alpha$semi and $\beta$semi, which successfully reproduce the numerically calculated magnetic field, can serve as benchmarks for more rigorous theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of solar activity on the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) data collected over 10 years. We report the observation of Solar Radio Burst signals in AERA data associated with intense solar flares accompanied by moderate and strong radio blackout levels recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, although in a frequency range different from AERA, the increased level of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation during periods of larger solar activity also impacts the AERA data in a twofold way: (i) causing the atmosphere to bounce terrestrial radio waves emitted by sources far from the AERA site or (ii) causing radio signals to become degraded or completely absorbed (radio blackout) if the solar radiation results in larger ionization of the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere, respectively. We describe the identification of both cases in AERA data with a remarkable correlation between the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), that represents the highest frequency that can be used for radio communication between two points located on the Earth, modulated by the solar cycle, and the broadband noise observed in the frequency range of 30-40 MHz.</description>

      <title>Composition variation of the May 16 2023 Solar Energetic Particle Event observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the combined charged particle measurements from Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) onboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO) to study the composition variation of the solar energetic particle (SEP) event occurring on May 16, 2023. During the event, SolO and PSP were located at a similar radial distance of ~0.7 au and were separated by $\sim$60$^\circ$ in longitude. The footpoints of both PSP and SolO were west of the flare region but the former was much closer (18$^\circ$ vs 80$^\circ$). Such a distribution of observers is ideal for studying the longitudinal dependence of the ion composition with the minimum transport effects of particles along the radial direction. We focus on H, He, O, and Fe measured by both spacecraft in sunward and anti-sunward directions. Their spectra are in a double power-law shape, which is fitted best by the Band function. Notably, the event was Fe-rich at PSP, where the mean Fe/O ratio at energies of 0.1 - 10 Mev/nuc was 0.48, higher than the average Fe/O ratio in previous large SEP events. In contrast, the mean Fe/O ratio at SolO over the same energy range was considerable lower at 0.08. The Fe/O ratio between 0.5 and 10 MeV/nuc at both spacecraft is nearly constant. Although the He/H ratio shows energy dependence, decreasing with increasing energy, the He/H ratio at PSP is still about twice as high as that at SolO. Such a strong longitudinal dependence of element abundances and the Fe-rich component in the PSP data could be attributed to the direct flare contribution. Moreover, the temporal profiles indicate that differences in the Fe/O and He/H ratios between PSP and SolO persisted throughout the entire event rather than only at the start.</description>
