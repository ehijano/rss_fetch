      <title>Compactification of quasi-local algebras on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compactification construction for abstract quasi-local C*-algebras over countable metric spaces equipped with an isometric group action which is functorial with respect to bounded spread isomorphisms. In $1$D, the construction recovers Ocneanu's Tube algebra for fusion spin chains, and provides a canonical bridge between infinite-volume observables and observables with periodic boundary conditions. We exploit this connection to derive an obstruction for the implementability of such topological symmetries as Kramers-Wannier type dualities on symmetric subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Dynamical boundary value problem for a viscoelastic half-space with cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical boundary value problem for viscoelastic half-space with cut in the form of a strip is considered. The problem is reduced to the singular integral equation of first kind. Using the method of orthogonal polynomials, the integral equation is reduced to an infinite system of linear algebraic equations. The quasi-completely regularity of the obtained system is proved and the reduction method for approximate solution is developed.</description>

      <title>Globalization of perturbative Chern-Simons theory on the moduli space of flat connections in the BV formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the perturbative path integral of Chern-Simons theory (the effective BV action on zero-modes) in Lorenz gauge, expanded around a (possibly non-acyclic) flat connection, as a family over the smooth irreducible stratum $\mathcal{M}' \subset \mathcal{M}$ of the moduli space of flat connections. We prove that it is horizontal with respect to the Grothendieck connection up to a BV-exact term. From it, we construct a volume form on $\mathcal{M'}$ - the "global partition function" - whose cohomology class is independent of the metric, and so is a 3-manifold invariant.
  As an element of the construction, we construct an extension of the perturbative partition function to a nonhomogeneous form on the space of triples $(A,A',g)$ consisting of (1) a "kinetic" flat connection $A$ around which Chern-Simons action is expanded, (2) a "gauge-fixing" flat connection $A'$, (3) a metric $g$. This extension is horizontal with respect to an appropriate Gauss-Manin superconnection (which involves the BV operator as a degree zero component).</description>

      <title>On path integrals for wave functions taking $p$-adic values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a $p$-adic path integral via $p$-adic multiple integrals. This integral describes the evolution of a wave function $\Psi(x)$, which is defined as a map from a domain in $\mathbb{C}_{p}$ to $\mathbb{C}_{p}$. We also compute the Feynman propagator for free particles, demonstrating that the result obtained is similar to the classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage properties of a jump process with constant drift where jump amplitudes and inter-arrival times follow arbitrary light-tailed distributions with smooth densities. Using a mapping to an effective discrete-time random walk, we identify three regimes determined by the drift strength: survival (weak drift), absorption (strong drift), and critical. We derive explicit expressions for exponential decay rates in the survival and absorption regimes, and characterize algebraic decay at the critical point. We also obtain asymptotic behavior of the mean first-passage time, number of jumps, and their variances for processes starting either close to the origin or far from it.</description>

      <title>Geometric Field Theory for Elastohydrodynamics of Cosserat Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slender structures are ubiquitous in biological and physical systems, from bacterial flagella to soft robotic arms. The Cosserat rod provides a mathematical framework for slender bodies that can stretch, shear, twist and bend. In viscous fluid environments at low Reynolds numbers - as encountered in soft matter physics, biophysics, and soft continuum robotics - inertial effects become negligible, and hydrodynamic forces are well approximated by Stokes friction. We demonstrate that the resulting elastohydrodynamic equations of motion, when formulated using Cartan's method of moving frames, possess the structure of a geometric field theory in which the configuration field takes values in SE(3), the Lie group of rigid body motions. This geometric formulation yields coordinate-independent equations that are manifestly invariant under spatial isometries and naturally suited to constitutive modeling based on Curie's principle. We derive integrability conditions that determine when constitutive laws can be derived from an energy functional, thereby distinguishing between passive and active material responses. We also obtain the beam limit for small deformations. Our results establish a unified geometric framework for the nonlinear mechanics of slender structures in slow viscous flow and enable efficient numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamic instabilities of a soft robotic arm in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and control of soft robots operating in fluid environments requires a careful understanding of the interplay between large elastic body deformations and hydrodynamic forces. Here we show that this interplay leads to novel elastohydrodynamic instabilities in a clamped soft robotic arm driven terminally by a constant pressure in a viscous fluid. We model the arm as a Cosserat rod that can stretch, shear and bend. We obtain invariant, geometrically exact, non-linear equations of motion by using Cartan's method of moving frames. Stability to small perturbations of a straight rod is governed by a non-Hermitian linear operator. Eigenanalysis shows that stability is lost through a Hopf bifurcation with the increase of pressure above a first threshold. A surprising return to stability is obtained with further increase of pressure beyond a second threshold. Numerical solutions of the non-linear equations, using a geometrically exact spectral method, confirms stable limit-cycle oscillations between these two pressure thresholds. An asymptotic analysis in the beam limit rationalizes these results analytically. This counterintuitive sequence of bifurcations underscores the subtle nature of the elastohydrodynamic coupling in Cosserat rods and emphasizes their importance for the control of the viscous dynamics of soft robots.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control over operation order built from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A,B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\rm fixed}^*$, yielding an explicit, analytic witness gap $\Delta(\omega)=p_{\rm switch}(\omega)-p_{\rm fixed}^*$. We prove that $\Delta(\omega)&gt;0$ is achievable, thereby certifying causal non-separability by purely algebraic means, and confirm this behaviour numerically. Conceptually, this furnishes a minimal non-Abelian $B_3$ control for a Gedankenexperiment in anyonic statistics.</description>

Abstract: For PT-symmetric periodic Schrodinger operator, which is a small perturbation of the zero potential, we calculate the spectrum and the divisor of zeroes of the Bloch function in the leading order of the perturbation theory. In particular, we show that the analogs of lacunae of the Bloch spectrum are ellipses, and their focal points coincide with the branch points of the spectral curve.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Resolved by Loop Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous analysis is presented for the entanglement spectrum of quantum many-body states possessing a higher-form group-representation symmetry generated by topological Wilson loops, which is generally non-invertible. A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multipartite entanglement structure of quantum states prepared by the Euclidean path integral over three-manifolds with multiple torus boundaries (the so-called link states) in both Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. For three-component link states in the Abelian theory, we derive an explicit formula for the R\'enyi multi-entropy in terms of linking numbers. We further show that the genuine multi-entropy faithfully quantifies the tripartite entanglement generated by GHZ-states, consistent with the fact that the prepared states are stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Causality as a guiding principle for physics beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is situated within the context of quantum gravity, broadly understood as any effort to explore the interplay between gravitation and the quantum realm, without necessarily requiring the quantization of the gravitational field itself. We focus on emergent theories, particularly those in which the causal structure and geometric concepts underlying the gravitational field in General Relativity are not fundamental but instead arise from more basic underlying degrees of freedom. Our attention is directed toward emergent approaches inspired by condensed matter physics. Rather than developing a full-fledged emergent theory and analyzing its detailed consequences, this work offers a concise roadmap of analyses and reflections relevant to emergent frameworks, without committing to any specific model. The thesis is divided into two parts, reflecting the distinct tools and analyses employed in each. The first addresses fundamental and conceptual aspects of emergent theories, focusing on the role of background structures, both regarding their implications for the theory and their constructive relevance. The second assumes the absence of singularities and horizons, a feature often expected in emergent frameworks, though the analyses remain agnostic and independent of specific theoretical commitments.</description>

      <title>On the spectral radius of the ratio of Girko matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Girko matrices have independent and identically distributed entries of mean zero and unit variance. In this note, we consider the random matrix model formed by the ratio of two independent Girko matrices, its entries are dependent and heavy-tailed. Our main message is that divided by the square root of the dimension, the spectral radius of the ratio converges in distribution, when the dimension tends to infinity, to a universal heavy-tailed distribution. We provide a mathematical proof of this high-dimensional phenomenon, under a fourth moment matching with a Gaussian case known as the complex Ginibre ensemble. In this Gaussian case, the model is known as the spherical ensemble, and its spectrum is a determinantal planar Coulomb gas. Its image by the inverse stereographic projection is a rotationally invariant gas on the two-sphere. A crucial observation is the invariance in law of the model under inversion, related to its spherical symmetry, and that makes, in a sense, edge and bulk equivalent. Our approach involves Girko Hermitization, local law estimates for Wigner matrices, lower bound estimates on the smallest singular value, and convergence of kernels of determinantal point processes. The universality of the high-dimensional fluctuation of the spectral radius of the ratio of Girko matrices turns out to be remarkably more accessible mathematically than for a single Girko matrix!</description>

      <title>The hypergraph isomorphism game, Hopf algebras and Galois extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and operational framework for quantum isomorphisms of hypergraphs, using tools from compact quantum group theory. We introduce a new synchronous version of the hypergraph isomorphism game whose game algebra uniformly encodes multiple notions of quantum isomorphisms of hypergraphs. We show that there exist hypergraphs that are quantum isomorphic but not classically isomorphic. For graphs, we show that the $*$-algebra of the hypergraph isomorphism game is a quotient of the $*$-algebra of the graph isomorphism game. We further prove that the hypergraph game algebra forms a bi-Galois extension over the quantum automorphism groups of the underlying hypergraphs. This allows us to deduce that the algebraic notion of a quantum isomorphism of hypergraphs coincides with the operational one coming from the existence of perfect quantum strategies. Viewing games themselves as hypergraphs, we analyze isomorphisms and the transfer of strategies within this setting. Finally, we construct a $*$-algebra whose representation theory characterizes distinct classes of quantum isomorphisms between non-local games.</description>

      <title>Modulated symmetries from generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position, enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable. In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries. Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of observables in FLRW spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a positively curved FLRW spacetime as a background in which a nonrelativistic quantum particle propagates according to the Schroedinger equation. The probability fluid for the corresponding quantum states is taken as a model for the cosmological fluid filling this FLRW Universe. The Hamiltonian operator governing this fictitious particle is proportional to the Laplacian operator derived from the FLRW metric, while the mass of the particle equals the overall matter of the Universe (baryonic and dark). A complete, orthonormal set of quantum eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is obtained. Restricting to radially symmetric states, the latter are then used to compute matrix elements and expectation values of two observables for which quantum operators are identified, namely, the cosmological constant and the gravitational Boltzmann entropy. This entropy is regarded as corresponding to a positively-curved FLRW geometry when the cosmological fluid filling the Universe occupies a given quantum state.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Angular Velocity Reconstruction in Parallel-Beam and Diffraction Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of uniquely determining a rotational motion from continuous time-dependent measurements within the frameworks of parallel-beam and diffraction tomography. The motivation stems from the challenge of imaging trapped biological samples manipulated and rotated using optical or acoustic tweezers. We analyze the conditions under which the rotation of the unknown sample can be uniquely recovered using the infinitesimal common line and circle method, respectively. We provide explicit criteria for the sample's structure and the induced motion that guarantee unique reconstruction of all rotation parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the set of objects for which uniqueness fails is nowhere dense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work solves a 28-year conjecture by showing that two major invariants of smooth 4-manifolds, the shadow model (motivated by statistical mechanics [Tur91]) and the simplicial Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field theory [CY93]), are in fact equal.
  These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence. Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the two models, provide a brief survey of the shadow construction \`a la Turaev, and suggest once again that the semisimple models have reached their limits.</description>

      <title>Continuous Topological Insulators Classification and Bulk Edge Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews recent results on the classification of partial differential operators modeling bulk and interface topological insulators in Euclidean spaces. Our main objective is the mathematical analysis of the unusual, robust-to-perturbations, asymmetric transport that necessarily appears at interfaces separating topological insulators in different phases. The central element of the analysis is an interface-current-observable describing this asymmetry. We show that this observable may be computed explicitly by spectral flow when the interface Hamiltonian is explicitly diagonalizable.
  We review the classification of bulk phases for Landau and Dirac operators and provide a general classification of elliptic interface pseudo-differential operators by means of domain walls and a corresponding bulk-difference invariant (BDI). The BDI is simple to compute by the Fedosov-H\"ormander formula implementing in a Euclidean setting an Atiyah-Singer index theory. A generalized bulk-edge correspondence then states that the interface current observable and the BDI agree on elliptic operators, whereas this is not necessarily the case for non-elliptic operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study coined Random Quantum Walks on the hexagonal lattice, where the strength of disorder is monitored by the coin matrix. Each lattice site is equipped with an i.i.d. random variable that is uniformly distributed on the torus and acts as a random phase in every step of the QW. We show exponential decay of the fractional moments of the Green function in the regime of strong disorder, that is whenever the coin matrix is sufficiently close to the fully localized case, using a fractional moment criterion and a finite volume method. In the decorrelated case, we deduce dynamical localization. Moreover, we adapt a topological index to our model and thereby obtain transport for some coin matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09218v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a cylindrical bialgebra, which is a quasitriangular bialgebra $H$ endowed with a universal K-matrix, i.e., a universal solution of a generalized reflection equation, yielding an action of cylindrical braid groups on tensor products of its representations. We prove that new examples of such universal K-matrices arise from quantum symmetric pairs of Kac-Moody type and depend upon the choice of a pair of generalized Satake diagrams. In finite type, this yields a refinement of a result obtained by Balagovi\'c and Kolb, producing a family of non-equivalent solutions interpolating between the quasi-K-matrix originally due to Bao and Wang and the full universal K-matrix. Finally, we prove that this construction yields formal solutions of the generalized reflection equation with a spectral parameter in the case of finite-dimensional representations over the quantum affine algebra $U_qL\mathfrak{sl}_2$.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric K-matrices for finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing spherical harmonics on the two-dimensional unit sphere as superpositions of Gaussian beams whose poles form well-separated point configurations. The distributional and analytic properties of the resulting spherical harmonics are determined by the geometry of these poles: when the configuration is equidistributed, the sequence of harmonics exhibits quantum ergodicity, while their $L^\infty$ norms are quantitatively controlled by the maximal clustering of poles within small neighborhoods of great circles.</description>

Abstract: We study It\^o SDE systems driven by oscillating functions of a single It\^o diffusion process. In the limit when oscillations become fast, we show that the solution process converges in law to the process defined by an SDE system driven by a multivariate Wiener process whose covariance we calculate explicitly. Interestingly, the limiting system of SDEs are most naturally stated using the Stratonovich integral. The problem has been originally motivated by experimental work and special cases of theorems proved here provide a rigorous treatment of equations arising from physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an approach developed by Melrose to study the geometry at infinity of the Nakajima metric on the reduced Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, we show that the Nakajima metric on a quiver variety is quasi-asymptotically conical (QAC) whenever its defining parameters satisfy an appropriate genericity assumption. As such, it is of bounded geometry and of maximal volume growth. Being QAC is one of two main ingredients allowing us to use the work of Kottke and the second author to compute its reduced $L^2$-cohomology and prove the Vafa-Witten conjecture. The other is a vanishing theorem in $L^2$-cohomology for exact wedge $3$-Sasakian metrics generalizing a result of Galicki and Salamon for closed $3$-Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan's $1/\pi$ series and conformal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan unveiled 17 extraordinary infinite series for $1/\pi$. In this work, we uncover their physics origin by relating them to 2D logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs), which emerge in diverse settings such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, percolation, polymers, and even holography. Through this LCFT connection, we reinterpret such infinite series in terms of fundamental CFT data -- the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients. This perspective leads to novel physics-inspired approximations for $1/\pi$. Drawing lessons from Ramanujan's formulae, we construct a new family of bases for expanding LCFT correlators that converge far more rapidly than the standard conformal block decomposition. This is achieved using recently developed stringy/parametric crossing-symmetric dispersion relations. Remarkably, when working with these new expansions, the action of a certain differential operator (which arises naturally from the Ramanujan connection) dramatically enhances convergence, with the entire contribution collapsing to that of the logarithmic identity operator. This striking simplification hints at a universal property of LCFTs. Finally, we discuss a new holographic interpretation of this unexpected mathematics-physics connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying geometric structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized symmetries and constraints, as demonstrated in several examples, including exterior covariant derivatives, linearized prescribed Riemann curvature, and linearized Einstein equations with sources.</description>

Abstract: We provide few remarks on nonlinear Landau damping that concerns decay of the electric field in the classical Vlasov-Poisson system near spatially homogenous equilibria. In particular, this includes the analyticity framework, \`a la Grenier-Nguyen-Rodnianski, for non specialists, treating the analytic case studied by Mouhot-Villani, among other remarks for plasmas confined on a torus and in the whole space. Finally, we also establish the nonlinear Landau damping for a family of Vlasov-Riesz systems, which are new and surprisingly include the borderline Vlasov-Dirac-Benney system in the sharp analytic spaces.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of cluster maps of type $D_{2N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend one of the main results from our joint work with Hone and Mase, in which we studied a deformed type $D_{4}$ map, to the general case of the type $D_{2N}$ for $N\geq3$. This can be achieved through a ``local expansion" operation, introduced in our joint work with Grabowski and Hone. This operation involves inserting a specific subquiver into the quiver arising from the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{4}$ map. This insertion yields a new quiver, obtained through the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{6}$ map and thus enables systematic generalization to higher ranks $D_{2N}$. We also study the degree growth of deformed type $D_{2N}$ map via the tropical method and conjecture that, for each $N$, the deformed map is an integrable, as indicated by the algebraic entropy test, the criterion for detecting integrability in the discrete dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Toward Holography on Biregular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scalar field theory on biregular trees, as a new model for discrete holography. Biregular trees are discrete symmetric spaces associated with the bulk isometry group SU(3) over the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. The bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary propagators exhibit distinct features absent on the regular tree or continuum AdS spaces, arising from the semihomogeneous nature of the bulk space. We compute the two- and three-point correlators of the putative boundary dual. The three-point correlator exhibits a nontrivial "tensor structure" via dependence on the homogeneity degree of a unique bulk point specified in terms of boundary insertion points. The computed OPE coefficients show dependence on zeta functions associated with the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. This work initiates the formulation of holography on a family of discrete holographic spaces that exhibit features of both flat space and negatively curved space.</description>

      <title>Saddle Point Configurations for Spherical Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate saddle point configurations in spherical ferromagnets with perpendicular anisotropy. These are modeled by a micromagnetic energy functional on the unit sphere that leads to the emergence of the so-called curvature induced Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. For this functional we establish the existence of two distinct types of saddle points with zero mapping degree. We use a parabolic flow approach inspired by the harmonic map heat flow where for certain highly symmetric initial conditions we can rule out finite and infinite time blowup. Hence, we obtain solutions of the underlying Euler--Lagrange equation in the long time limit. This is in contrast to harmonic maps between two-spheres, where every map is a local minimizer of the energy functional.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>On the geometric Satake equivalence for Kac-Moody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</description>

      <title>Hodge Laplacians on Weighted Simplicial Complexes: Forms, Closures, and Essential Self-Adjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit operator norm bounds and essential self-adjointness criteria for discrete Hodge Laplacians on weighted graphs and simplicial complexes. For unweighted $d$-regular graphs we prove the universal estimate $\|\widetilde{\Delta}_{1,*}\|\le 4(d-1)$, and we provide weighted extensions with a sharp comparability constant. These bounds apply without geometric completeness or curvature assumptions and ensure essential self-adjointness on natural cores. The approach extends to higher degrees via dual up/down degrees, and we show a unitary equivalence between skew and symmetric models on colorable complexes. For periodic lattices we complement the universal bounds with exact Floquet--Bloch constants, typically of order $2d$, illustrating both the sharpness in growth and the generality of our method.</description>
