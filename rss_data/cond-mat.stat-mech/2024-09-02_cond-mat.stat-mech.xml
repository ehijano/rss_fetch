      <title>Universal Stochastic Equations of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of a Two-Dimensional Blume-Capel Ferromagnet in an Oscillating Magnetic Field with a Constant Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a numerical study of the kinetic Blume-Capel (BC) model to find if it exhibits the metamagnetic anomalies previously observed in the kinetic Ising model for supercritical periods. We employ a heat-bath Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm on a square lattice in which spins can take values of $\pm 1, 0$, with a non-zero crystal field, subjected to a sinusoidal oscillating field in conjunction with a constant bias. In the ordered region, we find an equivalent hysteretic response of the order parameters with its respective conjugate fields between the kinetic and the equilibrium model. In the disordered region (supercritical periods), we observed two peaks, symmetrical with respect to zero bias, in the susceptibility and scaled variance curves, consistent with the numerical and experimental findings on the kinetic Ising model. This behavior does not have a counterpart in the equilibrium model. Furthermore, we find that the peaks occur at higher values of the bias field and become progressively smaller as the density of zeros, or the amplitude of the oscillating field, increases. Using nucleation theory, we demonstrate that these fluctuations, as in the Ising model, are not a critical phenomenon, but that they are associated with a crossover between a single-droplet (SD) and a multi-droplet (MD) magnetization switching mechanism. For strong (weak) bias, the SD (MD) mechanism dominates. We also found that the zeros concentrate on the droplets' surfaces, which may cause a reduced interface tension in comparison with the Ising model . Our results suggest that metamagnetic anomalies are not particular to the kinetic Ising model, but rather are a general characteristic of spin kinetic models, and provide further evidence that the equivalence between dynamical phase transitions and equilibrium ones is only valid near the critical point.</description>

      <title>Replica Analysis for Ensemble Techniques in Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection is a problem of statistics that aims to find the subset of the $N$-dimensional possible explanatory variables that are truly related to the generation process of the response variable. In high-dimensional setups, where the input dimension $N$ is comparable to the data size $M$, it is difficult to use classic methods based on $p$-values. Therefore, methods based on the ensemble learning are often used. In this review article, we introduce how the performance of these ensemble-based methods can be systematically analyzed using the replica method from statistical mechanics when $N$ and $M$ diverge at the same rate as $N,M\to\infty, M/N\to\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. As a concrete application, we analyze the power of stability selection (SS) and the derandomized knockoff (dKO) with the $\ell_1$-regularized statistics in the high-dimensional linear model. The result indicates that dKO provably outperforms the vanilla knockoff and the standard SS, while increasing the bootstrap resampling rate in SS might further improve the detection power.</description>

      <title>Experimental Verification of Demon-Involved Fluctuation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limit of energy saving in the control of small systems has recently attracted much interest due to the concept refinement of the Maxwell demon. Inspired by a newly proposed set of fluctuation theorems, we report the first experimental verification of these equalities and inequalities in a ultracold 40Ca ion system, confirming the intrinsic nonequilibrium in the system due to involvement of the demon. Based on elaborately designed demon-involved control protocols, such as the Szilard engine protocol, we provide experimentally quantitative evidence of the dissipative information, and observe tighter bounds of both the extracted work and the demon's efficacy than the limits predicted by the Sagawa-Ueda theorem. Our results substantiate a close connection between the physical nature of information and nonequilibrium processes at the microscale, which help further understanding the thermodynamic characteristics of information and the optimal design of nanoscale and smaller systems.</description>

      <title>Long-ranged double-layer forces at high ionic strengths, with a modified Restricted Primitive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments using the Surface Force Apparatus have found anomalously long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces in concentrated salt solutions. Meanwhile, theory and simulations have suggested ion clustering to be the possible origin of this behaviour. The popular Restricted Primitive Model of electrolyte solutions, in which the solvent is represented by a uniform relative dielectric screening factor, $\varepsilon_r$, is unable to resolve the anomalous underscreening observed in experiments. In this work, we modify the Restricted Primitive Model to account for local dielectric saturation within the ion hydration shell. The dielectric screening factor in our model locally decreases from the bulk value to a lower saturated value at the ionic surface. The parameters for the model are deduced so that typical salt solubilities are obtained. Our simulations for both bulk and slit geometries show that our model displays strong cluster formation and these give rise to long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces at distances similar to what has been observed in SFA measurements. An electrolyte model wherein the dielectric screening factor remains uniform does not display similar clusters, even with unreasonably low values of $\varepsilon_r$.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov spectra and fluctuation relations: Insights from the Galerkin-truncated Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imposition of a global constraint of the conservation of total kinetic energy on a forced-dissipative Burgers equation yields a governing equation that is invariant under the time-reversal symmetry operation, $\{\mathcal{T}: t \to -t; u \to -u \}$, where $u$ is the velocity field. Moreover, the dissipation term gets strongly modified, as the viscosity is no longer a constant, but a fluctuating, state dependent quantity, which can even become negative in certain dynamical regimes. Despite these differences, the statistical properties of different dynamical regimes of the time-reversible Burgers equation and the standard forced-dssipative Burgers equation are equivalent, \`a la Gallavotti's conjecture of \textit{equivalence of nonequilibrium ensembles}. We show that the negative viscosity events occur only in the thermalized regime described by the time-reversible equation. This quasi-equilibrium regime is examined by calculating the local Lyapunov spectra and fluctuation relations. A pairing symmetry among the spectra is observed, indicating that the dynamics is chaotic and has an attractor spanning the entire phase space of the system. The violations of the second law of thermodynamics are found to be in accordance with the fluctuation relations, namely the Gallavotti-Cohen relation based on the phase-space contraction rate and the Cohen-Searles fluctuation relation based on the energy production rate. It is also argued that these violations are associated with the effects of the Galerkin-truncation, the latter is responsible for the thermalization.</description>

      <title>Impact of ChatGPT on the writing style of condensed matter physicists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of ChatGPT's release on the writing style of condensed matter papers on arXiv. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant improvement in the English quality of abstracts written by non-native English speakers. Importantly, this improvement remains robust even after accounting for other potential factors, confirming that it can be attributed to the release of ChatGPT. This indicates widespread adoption of the tool. Following the release of ChatGPT, there is a significant increase in the use of unique words, while the frequency of rare words decreases. Across language families, the changes in writing style are significant for authors from the Latin and Ural-Altaic groups, but not for those from the Germanic or other Indo-European groups.</description>

      <title>The Liquid-Gas Transition in Granular Matter : a Question of Effective Friction ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comparative study of the best models available to describe granular fluids in order to investigate the extent to which it makes sense to speak about a liquid-gas transition in a system of particles that present no attractive interactions. It is shown that the gas and the liquid correspond to regimes with clearly distinct rheological responses. A microscopic interpretation of what happens at the transition in terms of the time scales relevant to the various physical processes is also presented and put the test against numerical data. Our work calls for more experiments to test our predictions on real systems.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Conductivity of Concentrated Electrolytes: A Stochastic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of ionic solutions to time-varying electric fields, quantified by a frequency-dependent conductivity, is essential in many electrochemical applications. Yet, it constitutes a challenging problem due to the combined effect of Coulombic interactions, hydrodynamics, and thermal fluctuations. Here, we study the frequency-dependent conductivity of ionic solutions using a stochastic density functional theory. In the limit of small concentrations, we recover the classical Debye and Falkenhagen (DF) result, predicting an increase in conductivity with field frequency. At higher concentrations, we use a modified Coulomb interaction potential that accounts for the hard-core repulsion between the ions, which was recently employed in the zero-frequency case. Consequently, we extend the DF result to concentrated electrolytes. We discuss experimental and numerical studies and the complexity of observing the DF effect in such setups.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Critical Dynamics with Emergent Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal critical properties can manifest themselves not only in spatial but also in temporal directions. It has been found that critical point with emergent symmetry exhibits intriguing spatial critical properties characterized by two divergent length scales, attracting long-term investigations. However, how the temporal critical properties are affected by emergent symmetry is largely unknown. Here we study the nonequilibrium critical dynamics in the three-dimensional ($3$D) clock model, whose critical point has emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. We find that in contrast to the magnetization $M$, whose relaxation process is described by the usual dynamic exponent $z$ of the $3$D XY universality class, the angular order parameter $\phi_q$ shows a remarkable two-stage evolution characterized by different dynamic critical exponents. While in the short-time stage the relaxation dynamics is governed by $z$, in the long-time stage the dynamics is controlled by a new dynamic exponent $z'$. Further scaling analyses confirm that $z'$ is an indispensable dynamic critical exponent. Our results may be detected in the hexagonal RMnO$_3$ (R$=$rare earth) materials experimentally.</description>

      <title>Efficient post-selection in light-cone correlations of monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum computing relies on the precision of quantum gates. However, quantum gates in practice are generally affected by dissipative environments, which can significantly reduce their fidelity. In this study, we elucidate fundamental relations between the average fidelity of generic quantum gates and the dissipation that occurs during the computing processes. Considering scenarios in which a quantum gate is subject to Markovian environments, we rigorously derive fidelity-dissipation relations that hold for arbitrary operational times. Intriguingly, when the quantum gate undergoes thermal relaxation, the result can be used as a valuable tool for estimating dissipation through experimentally measurable fidelity, without requiring detailed knowledge of the dissipative structure. For the case of arbitrary environments, we uncover a trade-off relation between the average fidelity and energy dissipation, implying that these quantities cannot be large simultaneously. Our results unveil the computational limitations imposed by thermodynamics, shedding light on the profound connection between thermodynamics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of probabilistic contact tracing in epidemic containment: the role of super-spreaders and transmission path reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent COVID-19 pandemic underscores the significance of early-stage non-pharmacological intervention strategies. The widespread use of masks and the systematic implementation of contact tracing strategies provide a potentially equally effective and socially less impactful alternative to more conventional approaches, such as large-scale mobility restrictions. However, manual contact tracing faces strong limitations in accessing the network of contacts, and the scalability of currently implemented protocols for smartphone-based digital contact tracing becomes impractical during the rapid expansion phases of the outbreaks, due to the surge in exposure notifications and associated tests. A substantial improvement in digital contact tracing can be obtained through the integration of probabilistic techniques for risk assessment that can more effectively guide the allocation of new diagnostic tests. In this study, we first quantitatively analyze the diagnostic and social costs associated with these containment measures based on contact tracing, employing three state-of-the-art models of SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Our results suggest that probabilistic techniques allow for more effective mitigation at a lower cost. Secondly, our findings reveal a remarkable efficacy of probabilistic contact-tracing techniques in performing backward and multi-step tracing and capturing super-spreading events.</description>

      <title>Improved real-space parallelizable matrix-product state compression and its application to unitary quantum dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Towards the efficient simulation of near-term quantum devices using tensor network states, we introduce an improved real-space parallelizable matrix-product state (MPS) compression method. This method enables efficient compression of all virtual bonds in constant time, irrespective of the system size, with controlled accuracy, while it maintains the stability of the wavefunction norm without necessitating sequential renormalization procedures. In addition, we introduce a parallel regauging technique to partially restore the deviated canonical form, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulation in subsequent steps. We further apply this method to simulate unitary quantum dynamics and introduce an improved parallel time-evolving block-decimation (pTEBD) algorithm. We employ the improved pTEBD algorithm for extensive simulations of typical one- and two-dimensional quantum circuits, involving over 1000 qubits. The obtained numerical results unequivocally demonstrate that the improved pTEBD algorithm achieves the same level of simulation precision as the current state-of-the-art MPS algorithm but in polynomially shorter time, exhibiting nearly perfect weak scaling performance on a modern supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</title>

Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental and understanding conditions. Here, focusing on a methodological procedure, we have worked with young individuals, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) whose NC was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) and during a short pretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs of Symmetric Local Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit forming an approximate t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Randomness in Quantum Circuits of Continuous Gate Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the accompanying paper of arXiv:2408.13472, we have established the method of characterizing the maximal order of approximate unitary designs generated by symmetric local random circuits, and have explicitly specified the order in the cases of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries. Here, we provide full details on the derivation of the main theorems for general symmetry and for concrete symmetries. Furthermore, we consider a general framework where we have access to a finite set of connected compact unitary subgroups, which includes symmetric local unitary gate sets.</description>
