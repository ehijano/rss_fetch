      <title>Universal countably chromatic graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the existence of a universal countably chromatic graph of size $\aleph_1$ together with the failure of continuum hypothesis is consistent. The proof is a forcing iteration of strongly proper ccc posets. The construction works for any uncountable successor cardinal $\kappa^+$, where $\kappa$ is regular.</description>

      <title>On the strength of ultrafilters above choiceless large cardinals and their Prikry forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strength of well-founded ultrafilters on ordinals above choiceless large cardinals and their associated Prikry forcings. Gabriel Goldberg showed that all but boundedly many regular cardinals above a rank Berkeley cardinal carry well-founded uniform ultrafilters. We prove several bounds on the large cardinal strength that is witnessed by such ultrafilters.
  We then extend the theory of Prikry forcing in this context and place limits on the cardinals that can be collapsed or singularized. Finally, we develop the notion of a tensor Prikry system, and use it to give new constructions for several consistency results in choiceless set theory. In particular, we build a new model in which all uncountable cardinals are singular.</description>

      <title>Partition Principle without Choice via Symmetric Iterations and Sheaf-Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Partition Principal ($\mathsf{PP}$) asserts that every surjection $A\twoheadrightarrow B$ admits an injection $B\hookrightarrow A$.
  In $\mathsf{ZF}$, $\mathsf{AC}$ implies $\mathsf{PP}$, and $\mathsf{PP}$ implies choice from well-ordered families (ACWO), hence $\mathsf{PP}\Rightarrow\mathsf{DC}$.
  Whether $\mathsf{PP}$ implies $\mathsf{AC}$ remains open.
  This paper has two contributions.
  (1) Preservation under symmetric iterations.
  We prove that $\mathsf{DC}$ is preserved by countable and, more generally, by $&lt;\!\kappa$--support symmetric iterations satisfying a finite--support discipline and the local exactness properties we isolate (coherent selection, mixing/restriction preserving hereditary symmetry, and support--directed exactness for filtered colimits).
  (2) A sheaf--topos route to internal $\mathsf{PP}$ and external $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  In the \'etal\'e sheaf topos $\mathbf E=\mathbf{Sh}(H\ltimes 2^{\mathbb N})$ we prove a {Local Embedding Property (LEP): for every epimorphism of displays there is a monomorphism in the opposite direction, hence the internal language of $\mathbf E$ validates $\mathsf{PP}$.
  Via the display representation and small--maps/AST hygiene (in particular, that monomorphisms are small), this yields a symmetric (external) model of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$, together with an independent internal witness of $\neg\mathsf {AC}$.</description>

      <title>On the Realizability of Prime Conjectures in Heyting Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that no total functional can uniformly transform $\Pi_1$ primality into explicit $\Sigma_1$ witnesses without violating normalization in $\mathsf{HA}$. The argument proceeds through three complementary translations: a geometric interpretation in which compositeness and primality correspond to local and global packing configurations; a proof-theoretic analysis demonstrating the impossibility of uniform $\Sigma_1$ extraction; and a recursion-theoretic formulation linking these constraints to the absence of total Skolem functions in $\mathsf{PA}$. The formal analysis in constructive logic is followed by heuristic remarks interpreting the results in informational terms.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Iterations with Countable and $&lt;\kappa$-Support: A Framework for Choiceless ZF Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for symmetric iterations with countable and, more generally, $&lt;\kappa$ support. Set-length iterations are handled uniformly, and when driven by a first-order definable template over Goedel-Bernays set theory with Global Choice (GBC), class-length iterations are also admitted. Limit stages with cf($\lambda$) &gt;= $\kappa$ use direct limits; those with cf($\lambda$) &lt; $\kappa$ use inverse limits via trees of conditions with tuple-stabilizer filters. The induced limit filters are normal and kappa-complete, yielding closure of hereditarily symmetric names and preservation of $ZF$. Under a $\kappa$-Baire/strategic-closure hypothesis we obtain $DC_{&lt; \kappa}$, and under Localization we obtain $DC_\kappa$.
  For countable support, we give an $\omega_1$-length construction that adds reals and refutes $AC$ while preserving $ZF+DC$. Mixed products (e.g., Cohen with Random) fit naturally by stability of pushforwards and restrictions, and the framework separates weak choice principles (e.g., failure of the Partition Principle alongside $DC$ or $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$).
  We extend the analysis to singular $\kappa$. When cf($\kappa$) = $\omega$ we provide complete proofs using block-partition stabilizers and trees of conditions. For arbitrary singular $\kappa$ we introduce game-guided fusion of length cf($\kappa$) and a tree-fusion master condition, establishing singular-limit completeness, preservation of $DC_{&lt; \kappa}$, no collapse of $\kappa$, and no new bounded subsets of $\kappa$. The resulting toolkit offers reusable patterns for constructing choiceless inner models with targeted fragments of dependent choice.</description>

      <title>First-Order Axiom Systems $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ and $\mathscr{E}_{da}$ Extending Tarski's $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ with Distance and Angle Function Symbols for Quantitative Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tarski's first-order axiom system $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ for Euclidean geometry is notable for its completeness and decidability. However, the Pythagorean theorem -- either in its modern algebraic form $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ or in Euclid's Elements -- cannot be directly expressed in $\mathscr{E}_{2}$, since neither distance nor area is a primitive notion in the language of $\mathscr{E}_{2}$. In this paper, we introduce an alternative axiom system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ in a two-sorted language, which takes a two-place distance function $d$ as the only geometric primitive. We also present a conservative extension $\mathscr{E}_{da}$ of it, which also incorporates a three-place angle function $a$. The system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ has two distinctive features: it is simple (with a single geometric primitive) and it is quantitative. Numerical distance can be directly expressed in this language. The Axiom of Similarity plays a central role in $\mathscr{E}_{d}$, effectively killing two birds with one stone: it provides a rigorous foundation for the theory of proportion and similarity, and it implies Euclid's Parallel Postulate (EPP). The Axiom of Similarity can be viewed as a quantitative formulation of EPP. The Pythagorean theorem and other quantitative results from similarity theory can be directly expressed in the languages of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ and $\mathscr{E}_{da}$, motivating the name Quantitative Euclidean Geometry. The traditional analytic geometry can be united under synthetic geometry in $\mathscr{E}_{d}$. Namely, analytic geometry is not treated as a model of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$, but rather, its statements can be expressed as first-order formal sentences in the language of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$. The system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ is shown to be consistent, complete, and decidable. Finally, we extend the theories to hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Extensional ESO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensional ESO is a fragment of existential second-order logic (ESO) that captures the following family of problems. Given a fixed ESO sentence $\Psi$ and an input structure $\mathbb A$ the task if to decide whether there is an extension $\mathbb B$ of $\mathbb A$ that satisfies the first-order part of $\Psi$, i.e., a structure $\mathbb B$ such that $R^{\mathbb A}\subseteq R^{\mathbb B}$ for every existentially quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$, and $R^{\mathbb A} = R^{\mathbb B}$ for every non-quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$. In particular, extensional ESO describes all pre-coloured finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
  In this paper we study the computational power of extensional ESO; we ask, for which problems in NP is there a polynomial-time equivalent problem in extensional ESO?. One of our main results states that extensional ESO has the same computational power as hereditary first-order logic. We also characterize the computational power of the fragment of extensional ESO with monotone universal first-order part in terms of finitely bounded CSPs. These results suggest a rich computational power of this logic, and we conjecture that extensional ESO captures NP-intermediate problems. We further support this conjecture by showing that extensional ESO can express current candidate NP-intermediate problems such as Graph Isomorphism, and Monotone Dualization (up to polynomial-time equivalence). On the other hand, another main result proves that extensional ESO does not have the full computational power of NP: there are problems in NP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in extensional ESP (unless E=NE).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new semi-algebraic proof systems for Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) analogous to the propositional systems Nullstellensatz, Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares. We transfer to this setting techniques both from the QBF literature (strategy extraction) and from propositional proof complexity (size-degree relations and pseudo-expectation). We obtain a number of strong QBF lower bounds and separations between these systems, even when disregarding propositional hardness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of formula equations in first-order logic, Horn formula equations, which are defined by a syntactic restriction on the occurrences of predicate variables. Horn formula equations play an important role in many applications in computer science. We state and prove a fixed-point theorem for Horn formula equations in first-order logic with a least fixed-point operator. Our fixed-point theorem is abstract in the sense that it applies to an abstract semantics which generalises standard semantics. We describe several corollaries of this fixed-point theorem in various areas of computational logic, ranging from the logical foundations of program verification to inductive theorem proving.</description>

Abstract: We study the question of $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ring}}$-definability of non-trivial henselian valuation rings. Building on previous work of Jahnke and Koenigsmann, we provide a characterization of henselian fields that admit a non-trivial definable henselian valuation. In particular, we treat cases where the canonical henselian valuation has positive residue characteristic, using techniques from the model theory and algebra of tame fields.</description>

Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Game}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>
