      <title>Comment to the paper J. Yan et al. Experimental confirmation of driving pressure boosting and smoothing for hybrid-drive inertial fusion at the 100-kJ laser facility [Nature Communications (2023) 14:5782]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of experimental data on the direct-drive pressure leads us to the conclusion that, the published experimental confirmation of driving pressure boosting and smoothing for hybrid-drive inertial fusion is not credible.</description>

      <title>Energetic bounds on gyrokinetic instabilities. Part 4. Bounce-averaged electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upper bounds on the growth of instabilities in gyrokinetic systems have recently been derived by considering the optimal perturbations that maximise the growth of a chosen energy norm. This technique has previously been applied to two-species gyrokinetic systems with fully kinetic ions and electrons. However, in tokamaks and stellarators, the expectation from linear instability analyses is that the most important kinetic-electron contribution to ion-scale modes comes from the trapped electrons, which bounce faster than the timescale upon which instabilities evolve. As a result, a fully-kinetic electron response is not required to describe unstable modes in most cases. Here, we apply the optimal mode analysis to a reduced two-species system that consists of fully gyrokinetic ions and bounce-averaged electrons with the aim of finding a tighter bound on ion-scale instabilities in toroidal geometry. This analysis yields bounds that are greatly reduced in comparison to the earlier two-species result. Moreover, if the energy norm is properly chosen, wave-particle resonance effects can be captured, reproducing the stabilisation of density-gradient-driven instabilities in maximum-$J$ devices. The optimal mode analysis also reveals that the maximum-$J$ property has an additional stabilising effect on ion-temperature-gradient-driven instabilities, even in the absence of an electron-free energy source. This effect is explained in terms of the concept of mode inertia, making it distinct from other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Using a coupled optical and electrical monitoring method to follow the R-HiPIMS TiO$_2$ deposition process drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, coupled optical and electrical discharge measurements have been implemented to investigate the plasma state of a reactive HiPIMS TiO$_2$ deposition process running at a fixed duty cycle of 2% and at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. Investigations focus on both the effect of the erosion target and substrate-holder temperature in an Ar/O$_2$ gas mixture at fixed working pressure. First, as the racetrack shape evolves with the use of the target, the deposition rate is modified, in the same way as the emission intensity measured. Second, with the heater set at 400 $^\circ$C in pure Ar, the coating appears thinner, and the optical emission spectroscopy measurement reveals the presence of oxygen atoms. Thus, the results from the coupled optical and electrical measurements are sensitive enough to track potential drift of the process.</description>

      <title>Calculation of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode mode structure in general axisymmetric toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A workflow is developed based on the ideal MHD model to investigate the linear physics of various Alfv\'en eigenmodes in general axisymmetric toroidal geometry, by solving the coupled shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) and ion sound wave (ISW) equations in ballooning space. The model equations are solved by the FALCON code in the singular layer, and the corresponding solutions are then taken as the boundary conditions for calculating parallel mode structures in the whole ballooning space. As an application of the code, the frequencies and mode structures of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode (TAE) are calculated in the reference equilibria of the Divertor Tokamak Test facility (DTT) with positive and negative triangularities, respectively. By properly handling the boundary conditions, we demonstrate finite TAE damping due to coupling with the local acoustic continuum, and find that the damping rate is small for typical plasma parameters.</description>

      <title>A similarity reduction of the generalized Grad-Shafranov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend previous work [Y. E. Litvinenko, Phys. Plasmas 17, 074502 (2010)] on a direct method for finding similarity reductions of partial differential equations such as the Grad-Shafranov equation, to the case of the generalized Grad-Shafranov equation (GGSE) with arbitrary incompressible flow. Several families of analytic solutions are constructed, the generalized Solov\'ev solution being a particular case, which contain both the classical and non-classical group-invariant solutions to the GGSE. Those solutions can describe a variety of equilibrium configurations pertinent to toroidal magnetically confined plasmas and planetary magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>On the stability and emittance growth of different particle phase-space distributions in a long magnetic quadrupole channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of K-V, waterbag, parabolic, conical and Gaussian distributions in periodic quadrupole channels is studied by particle simulations. It is found that all these different distributions exhibit the known K-V instabilities. But the action of the K-V type modes becomes more and more damped in the order of the types of distributions quoted above. This damping is so strong for the Gaussian distribution that the emittance growth factor after a large number of periods is considerably lower than in the case of an equivalent K-V distribution. In addition, the non K-V distributions experience in only one period of the channel a rapid initial emittance growth, which becomes very significant at high beam intensities. This growth is attributed to the homogenization of the space-charge density, resulting in a conversion of electric-field energy into transverse kinetic and potential energy. Two simple analytical formulae are derived to estimate the upper and lower boundary values for this effect and are compared with the results obtained from particle simulations.</description>
