      <title>Impurity-induced topological decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling topological phases is a central goal in quantum materials and related fields, enabling applications such as robust transport and programmable edge states. Here we uncover a mechanism in which local on-site impurities act as knobs to decompose global topological properties in discrete steps. In non-Hermitian lattices with spectral winding topology, we show that each impurity sequentially reduces the winding number by one, which is directly manifested as a stepwise decomposition of quantized plateaus in the steady-state response. Based on this principle, we further develop a scheme that sequentially induces topological edge states under impurity control, in a class of Hermitian topological systems constructed by doubling the non-Hermitian ones. Our findings reveal a general scheme to tune global topological properties with local perturbations, establishing a universal framework for impurity-controlled topological phases and offering a foundation for future exploration of reconfigurable topological phenomena across diverse physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear magnetization dynamics as a route to nonreciprocal phases, spin superfluidity, and analogue gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving resonant states for open double quantum-dot systems with spin degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-evolving resonant states in an open double quantum-dot system, taking into account spin degrees of freedom as well as both on-dot and interdot Coulomb interactions. We exactly derived a non-Hermite effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of two quantum dots, where the non-Hermiticity arises from an effect of infinite external leads connected to the quantum dots. By diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian, we identify four types of two-body resonant states. For the initial states of localized two electrons with opposite spins on the quantum dots, we exactly solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and obtain time-evolving two-body resonant states. The time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave function grows exponentially only inside a finite space interval that expands in time with electron velocity. By using the exact solution, we analyze the survival and transition probabilities of localized two electrons on the quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall (QH) edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility $\chi_q^R(k,\omega)$, we derive leading-order interaction corrections to both the edge heat flux and the plasmon spectrum. Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of the plasmon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Confined Bulk Plasmons in metallic nanoparticles by penetrating electron beams within a non-local analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a linear hydrodynamic model (HDM) we investigate theoretically the interaction between penetrating electron beams and sub-5 nm metallic spherical nanoparticles (NPs), and provide an analytical expression of the electron energy loss (EEL) probability including non-local effects in the response of the confined electron gas. We focus on the characterization of the longitudinal plasmon excitations, or confined bulk plasmons (CBPs), which cannot be addressed within local dielectric frameworks, and show that their excitation is highly sensitive to the impact parameter and kinetic energy of the incident electron beam, as well as to the NP's size. In contrast to the local approach, our decription captures a blueshift of the bulk plasmon envelope (BPE) with decreasing NP size and a blueshift with increasing impact parameter. Moreover, it predicts a threshold impact parameter, or minimum electron path inside the NP, to efficiently activate a set of CBPs. Exploiting the multipolar description of the CBPs we identify the underlying symmetry rules governing their excitation by electron beams, and correlate the observed blueshift of the BPE for increasing impact parameters with the excitation of higher-order CBPs. Dispersion of the CBPs with decreasing NP sizes further increases this impact parameter dependent blueshift of the BPE and also explains the decrease in the impact parameter threshold.</description>

      <title>Sensitive detection of the Rydberg transition in trapped electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. Here, we use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit in response to a pulsed-modulated microwave excitation. The result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of microwave-excited electrons rather than the quantum capacitance associated with their vertical displacement, as was recently reported. Our theoretical analysis based on the solution of the master equation shows that the quantum capacitance would show a response which is drastically different from what is observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Coulomb correlated multi-particle states of weakly confining GaAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA) longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g., $\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and $\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic structure and emission -- including the indistinguishability inferred from $P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$ -- and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.</description>

      <title>Deterministic single-photon source with on-chip 5.6 GHz acoustic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Heat measurement of quantum interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence plays a key role in the operation and performance of quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath in a system formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.</description>

      <title>Rabi oscillations of a monolayer quantum emitter driven through its excited state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a quantum two-level system with a resonant driving field results in the emergence of Rabi oscillations, which are the hallmark of a controlled manipulation of a quantum state on the Bloch sphere. This all-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for quantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a WSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using picosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is probed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level exciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and excited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate that the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying driving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data. Our results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based high-performance, on-demand single photon sources.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field controlled organic spintronic memristor for neural network computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors are emerging as key electronic components that retain resistance states without power. Their non-volatile nature and ability to mimic synaptic behavior make them ideal for next-generation memory technologies and neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain. In this study, we present a novel organic spintronic memristor based on a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co heterostructure, exhibiting biologically inspired synaptic behavior. Driven by fluorine atom migration within the PVDF layer, the device demonstrates both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) under controlled electrical polarization. Distinctively, the resistance states can also be modulated by an external magnetic field via the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, introducing a non-electrical means of tuning synaptic plasticity. This magnetic control mechanism enables multi-state modulation without compromising device performance or endurance. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN) simulations incorporating this magnetic tuning capability reveal enhanced pattern recognition accuracy and improved training stability, especially at high learning rates. These findings underscore the potential of organic spintronic memristors as high-performance, low-power neuromorphic elements, particularly suited for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>Prediction of a topological phase transition in exchange alternating spin-1 nanographene chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Thermoelectric Transport in Aharonov-Bohm-Casher Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines are nanoscale devices that convert heat into work by exploiting quantum effects, such as coherence and interference. Previous studies of these devices did not consider spin-dependent effects, which can influence the thermoelectric performance of the engine. In this work, we study the thermoelectric behavior of a quantum heat engine based on an Aharonov-Bohm ring - a mesoscopic ring where electrons exhibit interference depending on the magnetic flux it encloses - incorporating Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the electron's motion and spin. We find that Rashba SOI enhances the figure of merit $ZT$, measure of the engine's conversion efficiency. Our results suggest that controlling spin-dependent interference could lead to improvements in the fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Study of the Molecular Level Mechanism of Nanoscale Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT), a smectite clay with significant applications in environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials. We present a multiscale computational framework that integrates atomistic simulations with mesoscale modelling to explore the influence of interlayer and free pores on water and ion diffusion under varying dry densities (0.8--1.3 g/cm$^3$). The model incorporates experimentally determined platelet size distributions and explicitly accounts for polydispersity and anisotropic transport. The study results reveal that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water diffusion at the studied dry densities. Water diffusion predominantly occurs through free pores, with diffusion scaling factors closely aligning with experimental tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling was considered. The study also highlights the anisotropic nature of diffusion in Na-MMT, with diffusion parallel-to-compaction being significantly slower than in the normal direction which is consistent with experiments. The computational model, validated against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experimental data, provides insights into the geometric tortuosity and pore size distribution of Na-MMT. Despite its limitations, such as the absence of three-water minima energy profiles and rigid platelet assumptions, the model offers a robust framework for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on refining interlayer energy profiles and incorporating flexible platelet dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy with implications for optimizing materials in environmental, industrial, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling beyond the High-Q Limit and Linewidth Narrowing in a Multi-Exciton Planar Microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate unconventional linewidth narrowing and strong exciton-photon coupling in a planar hybrid microcavity (MC) with a low quality factor Q of around 300. As the broad photonic resonance approaches the heavy- and light-hole exciton transitions in GaAs quantum wells, three well-separated exciton-polariton branches emerge, accompanied by a counter-intuitive fourfold narrowing of the total linewidth. This behavior challenges conventional two-oscillator strong-coupling models and is only partially reproduced by transfer-matrix and Green's-function calculations, suggesting the involvement of frequency-dependent self-energies or correlated dissipation. Our findings demonstrate that strong coupling and coherence enhancement can occur even in highly lossy cavities, questioning the conventional requirement for high-Q microcavities and opening new design possibilities for polaritonic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical behavior of confined electrons under torsion and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of torsion, Aharonov-Bohm flux, and external magnetic fields on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a confined quantum system. The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior. This work highlights the potential of geometric and topological engineering in low-dimensional systems to control and enhance nonlinear optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Making the Virtual Real: Measurement-Powered Tunneling Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling allows electrons to be transferred between two regions separated by an energetically forbidden barrier. Performing a position measurement that finds a particle in the barrier forces the tunneling electrons to transition from having a classically forbidden energy to an energy above the barrier height. We exploit this effect to define quantum tunneling engines that can use the unconditioned detection of virtually occupied states as a resource for power generation and cooling. Leveraging energy exchange with the detector, we show that the device can operate in a hybrid regime, enabling simultaneous cooling and power generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-assisted autonomous refrigeration and "checkpoint" cooling driven purely by a thermal bias, without the need for an applied potential. We also find a "purification-by-noise" effect when the measurement drives the system into a stationary dark state. These results underscore the intriguing dual role of measurement as a thermodynamic resource and a dark state generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much is known about the magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic insulators, yet little is understood about multiferroic metals. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to identify the sliding van der Waals bilayer $1T$-NbTe$_2$ as a multiferroic metal, where in-plane metallicity coexists with out-of-plane polarization and magnetism. It exhibits linear magnetoelectric response, originating from direct spin-charge interactions as a result of external field-modulated Fermi energy, which differs from the spin-charge-lattice or spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in multiferroic insulators. We derive a universal formula for magnetoelectric coupling parameters of multiferroic metals, which highlights the crucial role of interlayer dielectric permittivity in enhancing performance. Our work provides insights for exploring magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and designing functional materials with strong magnetoelectric coupling.</description>

      <title>Switching between Skyrmions and Yoshimori Spin Spirals via Li Absorption in Janus Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures have attracted considerable attention owing to their topological properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. Here, we employ first-principles calculations together with atomic spin dynamics simulations to explore the switching between skyrmions and Yoshimori-type spin spirals induced by Li adsorption in Janus two-dimensional (2D) CrTeSe. We show that selective Li adsorption on either the Se- or Te-terminated surface stabilizes distinct magnetic phases: Li adsorption on the Se side favors a Yoshimori-type spin spiral, whereas adsorption on the Te side stabilizes the skyrmionic state. This contrast originates from site-dependent modifications of exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy (MA), and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition, the response of magnetic textures to out-of-plane magnetic fields differs strongly between the two systems. These results demonstrate that surface adsorption provides an effective strategy for reversible control of chiral magnetic states in 2D magnets, while also offering fundamental insights into the competing interactions that govern the stability of skyrmions and Yoshimori spin spirals. Our findings highlight the potential of Janus 2D materials as a versatile platform for engineering tunable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap - Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of layered, two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moir\'e physics with stacks of twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than in 2D van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after obvious issues of contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In hybrid interfaces between a chemically inert 2D material and an oxide membrane, the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. In all these material systems, the interface morphology is best characterized using cross-sectional imaging and is necessary to corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. When imaging the bicrystal in projection, conventional through-focal imaging is found to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasizes the need for reliable characterization methods.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of the produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing information in a microscopic system using its memory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</description>

Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, we present recent theoretical developments on spin transport phenomena probed by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modulation in two-dimensional systems coupled to magnetic materials. We first address FMR linewidth enhancements induced by spin pumping at interfaces, emphasizing their potential as sensitive probes of superconducting pairing symmetries in two-dimensional superconductors. We then examine FMR modulation due to spin pumping into two-dimensional electron gases formed in semiconductor heterostructures, where the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions enables gate-controlled spin transport and persistent spin textures. Finally, we investigate spin pumping in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, where spin-valley coupling and Berry curvature effects lead to valley-selective spin excitations and a spin-current Hall effect. These developments demonstrate that the spin pumping technique provides a versatile tool for probing spin transport and spin-dependent phenomena in low-dimensional systems, offering a basis for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Promoted current-induced spin polarization in inversion symmetry broken topological insulator thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate current-induced spin polarization in disordered topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry under an applied in-plane electric field. Utilizing the Kubo formalism within the self-consistent Born approximation and incorporating vertex corrections to account for multiple scattering events, we analyze how disorder, chemical potential, the electrostatic potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces, and momentum-dependent hybridization affect the spin susceptibility. Our results reveal that the spin susceptibility exhibits nonzero values within a finite range around a zero gap, and this range broadens as the chemical potential increases. A higher hybridization strength induces asymmetry in the spin response. A stronger potential difference, breaking inversion symmetry, significantly enhances polarization. This enhancement is a trend attributable to band inversion and is further refined by vertex corrections. These findings provide a theoretical framework for tuning spin-charge conversion in topological thin films, with implications for spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below N\'eel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Nanocapacitor Simulations of the Optical Dielectric Constant in Water Ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a combined density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework to compute the capacitance of nanocapacitors and directly extract the dielectric response of a sub-nanometer dielectric under bias. We identify that at the nanoscale conventional capacitance evaluations based on stored charge per unit voltage suffer from an ill-posed partitioning of electrode and dielectric charge. This partitioning directly impacts the geometric definition of capacitance through the capacitor width, which in turn makes the evaluation of dielectric response uncertain. This ambiguous separation further induces spurious interfacial polarizability when analyzed via maximally localized Wannier functions. Focusing on crystalline ice, we develop a robust charge-separation protocol that yields unique capacitance-derived polarizability and dielectric constants, unequivocally demonstrating that confinement neither alters ice's intrinsic electronic response nor its insensitivity to proton order. Our results lay the groundwork for rigorous interpretation of capacitor measurements in low-dimensional dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of Performance-Improved Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction Based on Trap-Assisted Tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as a new approach in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where strong-coupled magnon-photon modes can be achieved using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilization of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its experimental feasibility and wide generality as manifested in hematite.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium, resulting in a ferroelectric rectification of the driving signal.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.</description>

      <title>Electric field induced Berry curvature dipole and non-linear anomalous Hall effect in higher wave symmetric unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.</description>

Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</description>

Abstract: Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.</description>

      <title>P-orbital spin generator with large spin Hall angle and long spin diffusion length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect (SHE) highly limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong SOC results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, it is urgent to discovery new SHE materials with both large spin Hall conductivity and high spin transport ability beyond d-orbital materials. Here, we experimentally report a large charge to spin conversion in a p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). Our first-principles calculations reveal that small gap openings near the Fermi level lead to large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and enhance it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.</description>

      <title>Fast initialization of Bell states with Schr\"odinger cats in multi-mode systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.</description>

      <title>Emerging axion detection in artificial magnetoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak couplings to fermions and Chern-Simons couplings to gauge fields. We propose a novel detection mechanism based on symmetry-breaking magnetoelectric materials with a linear axionic coupling between magnetization and ferroelectric polarization. The focus is on a strain gradient Sr2IrO4 film, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and an out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables a direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field, which amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism is expected to enhance the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and stability of a non-Fermi liquid state near a quantum-critical point of a metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds for observables: Linear responses, Drude weight, and orbital magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bounds among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bounds for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, we demonstrate that bounds hold for all linear responses, which are produced by a QGT extended to many-body states, finite temperature, and general parameter space. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, we establish a bound between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bounds necessarily reflects quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, is discussed. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature, in accordance with previous investigations. An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>General Two-Parameter Model of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagom\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\'{e} QBCP and related materials.</description>
