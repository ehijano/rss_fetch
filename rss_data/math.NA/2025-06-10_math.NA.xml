      <title>Energy-stable Port-Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine energy-stable and port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems to obtain energy-stable port-Hamiltonian (espH) systems. The idea is to extend the known energy-stable systems with an input-output port, which results in a pH formulation. One advantage of the new espH formulation is that it naturally preserves its espH structure throughout discretization (in space and time) and model reduction.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of high-order isospectral symplectic Runge-Kutta schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospectral Runge-Kutta methods are well-suited for the numerical solution of isospectral systems such as the rigid body and the Toda lattice. More recently, these integrators have been applied to geophysical fluid models, where their isospectral property has provided insights into the long-time behavior of such systems. However, higher-order Isospectral Runge-Kutta methods require solving a large number of implicit equations. This makes the implicit midpoint rule the most commonly used due to its relative simplicity and computational efficiency. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that simplifies the implementation of general isospectral Runge-Kutta integrators. Our approach leverages block matrix structures to reduce the number of implicit equations per time step to a single one. This equation can be solved efficiently using fixed-point iteration. We present numerical experiments comparing performance and accuracy of higher-order integrators implemented with our algorithm against the implicit midpoint rule. Results show that, for low-dimensional systems, the higher-order integrators yield improved conservation properties with comparable computational cost. For high-dimensional systems, while our algorithm continues to show better conservation properties, its performance is less competitive, though it can be improved through parallelization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new finite element method for linearized Magnetohydrodynamics. The main novelty is that the proposed scheme is able to handle also non-convex domains and less regular solutions. The method is proved to be pressure robust and quasi-robust with respect to both fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete finite element approximation for the projection method to solve the Chemotaxis-Fluid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a chemotaxis-fluid interaction model governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the classical Keller-Segel chemotaxis system. To numerically solve this coupled system, we develop a pressure-correction projection finite element method based on a projection framework. The proposed scheme employs a backward Euler method for temporal discretization and a mixed finite element method for spatial discretization. Nonlinear terms are treated semi-implicitly to enhance computational stability and efficiency. We further establish rigorous error estimates for the fully discrete scheme, demonstrating the convergence of the numerical method. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the stability, accuracy, and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results confirm the scheme's capability to capture the essential dynamical behaviors and characteristic features of the chemotaxis-fluid system.</description>

      <title>Fourth- and higher-order finite element methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the unconstrained pressure Poisson equation (PPE) formulation [Liu, Liu, \&amp; Pego, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 60 (2007): 1443-1487], we previously proposed the generic projection and unconstrained PPE (GePUP) formulation [Zhang, J. Sci. Comput. 67 (2016): 1134-1180] for numerically solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) with no-slip boundary conditions. In GePUP, the main evolutionary variable does not have to be solenoidal with its divergence controlled by a heat equation. This work presents high-order finite-element solvers for the INSE under the framework of method-of-lines. Continuous Lagrange finite elements of equal order are utilized for the velocity and pressure finite element spaces to discretize the weak form of GePUP in space, while high-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods are then employed to treat the stiff diffusion term implicitly and the other terms explicitly. Due to the implicit treatment of the diffusion term, the time step size is only restricted by convection. The solver is efficient in that advancing the solution at each time step only involves solving a sequence of linear systems either on the velocity or on the pressure with geometric multigrid methods. Furthermore, the solver is enhanced with adaptive mesh refinement so that the multiple length scales and time scales in flows at moderate or high Reynolds numbers can be efficiently resolved. Numerical tests with various Reynolds numbers are performed for the single-vortex test, the lid-driven cavity, and the flow past a cylinder/sphere, demonstrating the high-order accuracy of GePUP-FEM both in time and in space and its capability of accurately and efficiently capturing the right physics. Moreover, our solver offers the flexibility in choosing velocity and pressure finite element spaces and is free of the standard inf-sup condition.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving, second-order-in-time scheme for the von Neumann equation with power nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a structure-preserving, linearly implicit, second-order-in-time scheme for the numerical solution of the von Neumann equation with power nonlinearity (also known as the Alber equation). Fourth order finite differences are used for the spatial discretization. We highlight the importance of the correct initialization of the method in achieving the expected order of convergence in space and time. As illustrative examples, we investigate the bifurcation from Landau damping to modulation instability. In that context, amplification factors in the fully developed modulation instability for this nonlinear equation are computed for the first time.</description>

      <title>Estimation of sparse polynomial approximation error to continuous function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparse polynomial approximation of continuous functions has emerged as a prominent area of interest in function approximation theory in recent years. A key challenge within this domain is the accurate estimation of approximation errors. This paper focuses on continuous functions, characterizing their sampled values as a combination of the values of their best approximation polynomials within a finite-dimensional polynomial space and the associated remainder terms. Consequently, the sampled values of a function can be interpreted as noisy samples of the values of its best approximation polynomial, with the noise equivalent to the remainder term's values at those points. By selecting a uniformly bounded orthonormal polynomial system as the basis for this finite-dimensional space, it becomes feasible to formulate noise constraint inequalities and l1-minimization problems or their weighted l1-minimization variants. This paper provides estimations for the approximation error of the sparse polynomial derived from the l1-minimization method, characterizing the error in terms of the quasi-norm of the sampled function or its best uniform approximation polynomial, the sparsity, and the best approximation error. The analysis reveals that if the sampled function is a sparse polynomial from a finite-dimensional space, it can be reconstructed exactly. Moreover, it is observed that the smoother the sampled function, the fewer degrees of the sparse polynomial are required to attain a given approximation accuracy. The paper also extends this analysis to estimate the L2-norm approximation error for the sparse polynomial obtained via the weighted l1-minimization method, noting that in this context, the orthonormal polynomial system does not need to be uniformly bounded for the conclusions to hold.</description>

      <title>On the randomized SVD in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized methods, such as the randomized SVD (singular value decomposition) and Nystr\"om approximation, are an effective way to compute low-rank approximations of large matrices. Motivated by applications to operator learning, Boull\'e and Townsend (FoCM, 2023) recently proposed an infinite-dimensional extension of the randomized SVD for a Hilbert--Schmidt operator $A$ that invokes randomness through a Gaussian process with a covariance operator $K$. While the non-isotropy introduced by $K$ allows one to incorporate prior information on $A$, an unfortunate choice may lead to unfavorable performance and large constants in the error bounds. In this work, we introduce a novel infinite-dimensional extension of the randomized SVD that does not require such a choice and enjoys error bounds that match those for the finite-dimensional case. Moreover, it reflects the common practice of using the randomized SVD with isotropic random vectors, also when approximating discretized operators. In fact, the theoretical results of this work show how the usual randomized SVD applied to a discretization of $A$ approaches our infinite-dimensional extension as the discretization gets refined, both in terms of error bounds and the Wasserstein distance. We also present and analyze a novel extension of the Nystr\"om approximation for self-adjoint positive semi-definite trace class operators.</description>

      <title>Deep regularization networks for inverse problems with noisy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss. Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data, quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case, the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality in complex environments.</description>

      <title>A novel efficient structure-preserving exponential integrator for Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a linearly implicit structure-preserving numerical method for semilinear Hamiltonian systems with polynomial nonlinearities, combining Kahan's method and exponential integrator. This approach efficiently balances computational cost, accuracy and the preservation of key geometric properties, including symmetry and near-preservation of energy. By requiring only the solution of a single linear system per time step, the proposed method offers significant computational advantages while comparing with the state-of-the-art symmetric energy-preserving exponential integrators. The stability, efficiency and long-term accuracy of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on systems such as the Henon-Heiles system, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system and the two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznestov equation.</description>

      <title>The PML method for calculating the propagating modes of electromagnetic wave in periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the electromagnetic wave is incident on the periodic structures, in addition to the scattering field, some propagating modes that are traveling in the periodic medium could be generated. In the present paper, we study the calculation of propagating modes. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem in an unbounded periodic domain. Then we use perfectly matched layers to truncate the unbounded domain, recast the problem to a quadratic eigenvalue problem, and prove the approximation property of the truncation. Finally, we formulate the quadratic eigenvalue problem to a general eigenvalue problem, use the finite element method to discrete the truncation problem, and show numerical examples to verify theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Computational homogenization of parabolic equations with memory effects for a periodic heterogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In homogenization theory, mathematical models at the macro level are constructed based on the solution of auxiliary cell problems at the micro level within a single periodicity cell. These problems are formulated using asymptotic expansions of the solution with respect to a small parameter, which represents the characteristic size of spatial heterogeneity. When studying diffusion equations with contrasting coefficients, special attention is given to nonlocal models with weakly conducting inclusions. In this case, macro-level processes are described by integro-differential equations, where the difference kernel is determined by the solution of a nonstationary cell problem. The main contribution of this work is the development of a computational framework for the homogenization of nonstationary processes, accounting for memory effects. The effective diffusion tensor is computed using a standard numerical procedure based on finite element discretization in space. The memory kernel is approximated by a sum of exponentials obtained from solving a partial spectral problem on the periodicity cell. The nonlocal macro-level problem is transformed into a local one, where memory effects are incorporated through the solution of auxiliary nonstationary problems. Standard two-level time discretization schemes are employed, and unconditional stability of the discrete solutions is proved in appropriate norms. Key aspects of the proposed computational homogenization technique are illustrated by solving a two-dimensional model problem.</description>

      <title>New highly efficient and accurate numerical scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on a generalized scalar auxiliary variable approach with relaxation (R-GSAV), we construct a class of high-order backward differentiation formula (BDF) schemes with variable time steps for the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman(CHB) system. In theory, it is strictly proved that the designed schemes are unconditionally energy-stable. With the delicate treatment of adaptive strategies, we propose several adaptive time-step algorithms to enhance the robustness of the schemes. More importantly, a novel hybrid-order adaptive time steps algorithm performs outstanding for the coupled system. The hybrid-order algorithm inherits the advantages of some traditional high-order BDF adaptive strategies. A comprehensive comparison with some adaptive time-step algorithms is given, and the advantages of the new adaptive time-step algorithms are emphasized. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the new methods are validated through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient linear energy stable methods for preserving the original energy dissipation law of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive computational framework to construct highly efficient linear energy stable methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, which preserve the original energy dissipation law. By multiplying the convection term by an identity-one term and incorporating a zero stabilization term, we recast the original model as a strongly equivalent system, while ensuring the retention of the original energy dissipation law. Such nonlinear system is then discretized in time based on the Crank-Nicolson schemes and the backward differentiation formulas, resulting in highly efficient time-discrete schemes. The proposed schemes are designed to preserve the original energy dissipation law while requiring only the solutions of three linear Stokes systems and a $2\times 2$ linear system at each time step. The finite difference approximation on a staggered grid is employed for the time-discrete systems to derive fully discrete energy stable schemes, which are proven to preserve the original energy dissipation law and be uniquely solvable. We present the efficient implementation of these methods. Various numerical experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy, efficacy, and advantageous performance of our newly developed methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are examined. Explicit 2N-storage constraints are derived for the first time and used to establish new relations between the entries of the Butcher tableau. An error in the Williamson's formula for converting coefficients between the standard and 2N-storage formats in the special case is pointed out and corrected. The new relations are used to derive a closed-form solution for four- and five-stage 2N-storage methods with the third order of global accuracy. Several new four- and five-stage schemes with rational coefficients are presented and numerically examined for illustration.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation and Analysis of the Inverse Robin Problem Using the Kohn-Vogelius Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we numerically investigate the inverse Robin problem of recovering a piecewise constant Robin coefficient in an elliptic or parabolic problem from the Cauchy data on a part of the boundary, a problem that commonly arises in applications such as non-destructive corrosion detection. We employ a Kohn-Vogelius type variational functional for the regularized reconstruction, and discretize the resulting optimization problem using the Galerkin finite element method on a graded mesh. We establish rigorous error estimates on the recovered Robin coefficient in terms of the mesh size, temporal step size and noise level. This is achieved by combining the approximation error of the direct problem, a priori estimates on the functional, and suitable conditional stability estimates of the continuous inverse problem. We present several numerical experiments to illustrate the approach and to complement the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Multiscale model reduction and two-level Schwarz preconditioner for H(curl) elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the efficient solution of linear systems arising from curl-conforming finite element discretizations of $H(\mathrm{curl})$ elliptic problems with heterogeneous coefficients. We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>The pollution effect for the Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation properties of solutions to the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) in finite element spaces. Special attention is given to how the errors are influenced by coupling the mesh size $h$ and the polynomial degree $p$ of the finite element space to the size of the so-called Ginzburg-Landau material parameter $\kappa$. As observed in previous works, the finite element approximations to the GLE are suffering from a numerical pollution effect, that is, the best-approximation error in the finite element space converges under mild coupling conditions between $h$ and $\kappa$, whereas the actual finite element solutions possess poor accuracy in a large pre-asymptotic regime which depends on $\kappa$. In this paper, we provide a new error analysis that allows us to quantify the pre-asymptotic regime and the corresponding pollution effect in terms of explicit resolution conditions. In particular, we are able to prove that higher polynomial degrees reduce the pollution effect, i.e., the accuracy of the best-approximation is achieved under relaxed conditions for the mesh size. We provide both error estimates in the $H^1$- and the $L^2$-norm and we illustrate our findings with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>IDENT Review: Recent Advances in Identification of Differential Equations from Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations and numerical methods are extensively used to model various real-world phenomena in science and engineering. With modern developments, we aim to find the underlying differential equation from a single observation of time-dependent data. If we assume that the differential equation is a linear combination of various linear and nonlinear differential terms, then the identification problem can be formulated as solving a linear system. The goal then reduces to finding the optimal coefficient vector that best represents the time derivative of the given data. We review some recent works on the identification of differential equations. We find some common themes for the improved accuracy: (i) The formulation of linear system with proper denoising is important, (ii) how to utilize sparsity and model selection to find the correct coefficient support needs careful attention, and (iii) there are ways to improve the coefficient recovery. We present an overview and analysis of these approaches about some recent developments on the topic.</description>

      <title>Data-Informed Mathematical Characterization of Absorption Properties in Artificial and Natural Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we characterize the water absorption properties of selected porous materials through a combined approach that integrates laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling. Specifically, experimental data from imbibition tests on marble, travertine, wackestone and mortar mock-ups are used to inform and validate the mathematical and simulation frameworks. First, a monotonicity-preserving fitting procedure is developed to preprocess the measurements, aiming to reduce noise and mitigate instrumental errors. The imbibition process is then simulated through a partial differential equation model, with parameters calibrated against rough and smoothed data. The proposed procedure appears particularly effective to characterize absorption properties of different materials and it represents a reliable tool for the study and preservation of cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>Minimal Subsampled Rank-1 Lattices for Multivariate Approximation with Optimal Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show error bounds for randomly subsampled rank-1 lattices. We pay particular attention to the ratio of the size of the subset to the size of the initial lattice, which is decisive for the computational complexity. In the special case of Korobov spaces, we achieve the optimal polynomial sampling complexity whilst having the smallest initial lattice possible. We further characterize the frequency index set for which a given lattice is reconstructing by using the reciprocal of the worst-case error achieved using the lattice in question. This connects existing approaches used in proving error bounds for lattices. We make detailed comments on the implementation and test different algorithms using the subsampled lattice in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Spectral Solution of the Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid numerical-quantum method for solving the Poisson equation under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, leveraging the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to enhance computational efficiency and reduce time and space complexity. This approach bypasses the integration-heavy calculations of classical methods, which have to deal with high computational costs for large number of points. The proposed method estimates the coefficients of the series expansion of the solution directly within the quantum framework. Numerical experiments validate its effectiveness and reveal significant improvements in terms of time and space complexity and solution accuracy, demonstrating the capability of quantum-assisted techniques to contribute in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite the inherent challenges of quantum implementation, the present work serves as a starting point for future researches aimed at refining and expanding quantum numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Lengthscale-informed sparse grids for kernel methods in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel interpolation, especially in the context of Gaussian process emulation, is a widely used technique in surrogate modelling, where the goal is to cheaply approximate an input-output map using a limited number of function evaluations. However, in high-dimensional settings, such methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality; the number of required evaluations to achieve a fixed approximation error grows exponentially with the input dimension. To overcome this, a common technique used in high-dimensional approximation methods, such as quasi-Monte Carlo and sparse grids, is to exploit functional anisotropy: the idea that some input dimensions are more 'sensitive' than others. In doing so, such methods can significantly reduce the dimension dependence in the error. In this work, we propose a generalisation of sparse grid methods that incorporates a form of anisotropy encoded by the lengthscale parameter in Mat\'ern kernels. We derive error bounds and perform numerical experiments that show that our approach enables effective emulation over arbitrarily high dimensions for functions exhibiting sufficient anisotropy.</description>

      <title>A Directional-ODE Framework for Discretization of Advection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach that redefines the traditional interpretation of explicit and implicit discretization methods for solving a general class of advection-diffusion equations (ADEs) featuring nonlinear advection, diffusion operators, and potential source terms. By reformulating the discrete ADEs as directional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along temporal or spatial dimensions, we derive analytical solutions that lead to novel update formulas. In essence, the information of discrete ADEs is compressed into these directional ODEs, which we refer to as representative ODEs. The analytical update formulas derived from the representative ODEs significantly enhance stability, computational efficiency, and spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we extend the framework to systems with uncertain parameters and coefficients, showcasing its versatility in addressing complex ADEs encountered in modeling and simulation across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>CIR bridge for modeling of fish migration on sub-hourly scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridges, which are stochastic processes with pinned initial and terminal conditions, have recently been applied to solve various problems. We show that a bridge based on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, called a CIR bridge in this paper, reasonably models the intraday number of migrating fish at an observation point in a river. The studied fish migrates between sunrise and sunset each day, which are considered the initial and terminal times, respectively. The CIR bridge is well-defined as a unique pathwise continuous solution to a stochastic differential equation with unbounded drift and diffusion coefficients and potentially represents the on-off intermittency of the fish count data. Our bridge is theoretically novel in that it admits closed-form time-dependent averages and variances, with which the model parameters can be identified efficiently, and is computable by a recently-developed one-step numerical method. The CIR bridge is applied to the sub-hourly migration data of the diadromous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis in the Nagara River, Japan, from February to June.</description>

      <title>Centrality Change Proneness: an Early Indicator of Microservice Architectural Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the wide adoption of Microservice Architecture has required the identification of various patterns and anti-patterns to prevent Microservice Architectural Degradation. Frequently, the systems are modelled as a network of connected services. Recently, the study of temporal networks has emerged as a way to describe and analyze evolving networks. Previous research has explored how software metrics such as size, complexity, and quality are related to microservice centrality in the architectural network. This study investigates whether temporal centrality metrics can provide insight into the early detection of architectural degradation by correlating or affecting software metrics. We reconstructed the architecture of 7 releases of an OSS microservice project with 42 services. For every service in every release, we computed the software and centrality metrics. From one of the latter, we derived a new metric, Centrality Change Proneness. We then explored the correlation between the metrics. We identified 7 size and 5 complexity metrics that have a consistent correlation with centrality, while Centrality Change Proneness did not affect the software metrics, thus providing yet another perspective and an early indicator of microservice architectural degradation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Riemann Problem Method for the Kapila Model of Compressible Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A second-order accurate and robust numerical scheme is developed for the Kapila model to simulate compressible multiphase flows. The scheme is formulated within the finite volume framework with the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver employed as the cornerstone. Besides Riemann solutions, the GRP solver provides time derivatives of flow variables at cell interfaces, achieving second-order accuracy in time within a single stage. The use of the GRP solver enhances the capability of the resulting scheme to handle the stiffness of the Kapila model in two ways. First, the coupled values, i.e., Riemann solutions and time derivatives, give the cell interface values of flow variables at the new time level, yielding an approximation to the cell average of the velocity divergence at the new time level in a computational step. This allows a semi-implicit time discretization to the stiff source term of the volume fraction equation. Second, the effects of source terms are directly included in the numerical flux via the computation of time derivatives. The resulting numerical flux is able to capture the physics of interactions between phases, and the robustness of the scheme is therefore further improved. Several challenging numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed finite volume scheme. In particular, a test case with a nonlinear smooth solution is designed to verify the numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Approximation Rates for Deep Super ReLU Networks on Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) as a method for approximating functions in Sobolev spaces measured by Sobolev norms $W^{m,p}$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $m\ge 2$ and $1\le p\le +\infty$. Standard ReLU deep neural networks (ReLU DNNs) cannot achieve this goal. DSRNs consist primarily of ReLU DNNs, and several layers of the square of ReLU added at the end to smooth the networks output. This approach retains the advantages of ReLU DNNs, leading to the straightforward training. The paper also proves the optimality of DSRNs by estimating the VC-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs, and obtains the generalization error in Sobolev spaces via an estimate of the pseudo-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Schemes for 3-Wave Kinetic Equations: A Complete Treatment of the Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, numerical schemes for a simplified version of 3-wave kinetic equations, in which only the simple forward-cascade terms of the collision operators are kept, have been successfully designed, especially to capture the long time dynamics of the equation given the multiple blow-up time phenomenon. In this second work in the series, we propose numerical treatments for the complete 3-wave kinetic equations, in which the complete, much more complicated collision operators are fully considered based on a novel conservative form of the equation. We then derive an implicit finite volume scheme to solve the equation. The new discretization uses an adaptive time-stepping method which allows for the simulations to be carried to very long times. Our computed solutions are compared with previously derived long-time asymptotic estimates for the decay rate of total energy of time-dependent solutions of 3-wave kinetic equations and found to be in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>An adaptive finite element multigrid solver using GPU acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive finite elements combined with geometric multigrid solvers are one of the most efficient numerical methods for problems such as the instationary Navier-Stokes equations. Yet despite their efficiency, computations remain expensive and the simulation of, for example, complex flow problems can take many hours or days. GPUs provide an interesting avenue to speed up the calculations due to their very large theoretical performance. However, the large degree of parallelism and non-standard API make the use of GPUs in scientific computing challenging. In this work, we develop a GPU acceleration for the adaptive finite element library Gascoigne and study its effectiveness for different systems of partial differential equations. Our goal is thereby to integrate the GPU acceleration into the existing code with minimal changes, even when this requires a penalty in the GPU acceleration. Through the systematic formulation of all computations as linear algebra operations, we can employ GPU-accelerated linear algebra libraries, which simplifies the implementation and ensures the maintainability of the code while achieving very efficient GPU utilizations. Our results for a transport-diffusion equation, linear elasticity, and the instationary Navier-Stokes equations show substantial speedups of up to 20X compared to multi-core CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>A Random Integration Algorithm for High-dimensional Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16627v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel random integration algorithm that boasts both high convergence order and polynomial tractability for functions characterized by sparse frequencies or rapidly decaying Fourier coefficients. Specifically, for integration in periodic isotropic Sobolev space and the isotropic Sobolev space with compact support, our approach attains a nearly optimal root mean square error (RMSE) bound. In contrast to previous nearly optimal algorithms, our method exhibits polynomial tractability, ensuring that the number of samples does not scale exponentially with increasing dimensions. Our integration algorithm also enjoys nearly optimal bound for weighted Korobov space. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied without the need for prior knowledge of weights, distinguishing it from the component-by-component algorithm. For integration in the Wiener algebra, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the decay rate of Fourier coefficients. The effectiveness of the integration is confirmed through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A normalized gradient flow method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.</description>

      <title>Meshless moment-free quadrature formulas arising from numerical differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a method for simultaneously generating high order quadrature weights for integrals over Lipschitz domains and their boundaries that requires neither meshing nor moment computation. The weights are determined on pre-defined scattered nodes as a minimum norm solution of a sparse underdetermined linear system arising from a discretization of a suitable boundary value problem by either collocation or meshless finite differences. The method is easy to implement independently of the domain's representation, since it only requires as inputs the position of all quadrature nodes and the direction of outward-pointing normals at each node belonging to the boundary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and high accuracy of the method on a number of smooth and piecewise smooth domains in 2D and 3D, including some with reentrant corners and edges. Comparison with quadrature schemes provided by the state-of-the-art open source packages Gmsh and MFEM shows that the new method is competitive in terms of accuracy for a given number of nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational inverse problems, the optimal experimental design (OED) problem seeks the best locations in time and space at which to take measurements. We investigate the nonlinear OED problem in the context of continuously-indexed design space for the measurements. In contrast to traditional approaches that select experiments from a finite measurement set, a continuous design space is often a better reflection of practical experimental options, where there is considerable flexibility concerning where and when to take measurements. The continuously-indexed space introduces computational challenges, and we address them by employing gradient-flow and optimal transport techniques, complemented by an adaptive strategy for bi-level optimization. Numerical results on the Lorenz 63 system and Schrodinger equation demonstrate that our solver identifies good measurement times / locations and achieves improved reconstruction of unknown parameters in inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of HiPPO-LegS ODE for Deep State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In deep learning, the recently introduced state space models utilize HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) memory units to approximate continuous-time trajectories of input functions using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and these techniques have shown empirical success in capturing long-range dependencies in long input sequences. However, the mathematical foundations of these ODEs, particularly the singular HiPPO-LegS (Legendre Scaled) ODE, and their corresponding numerical discretizations remain unsettled. In this work, we fill this gap by establishing that HiPPO-LegS ODE is well-posed despite its singularity, albeit without the freedom of arbitrary initial conditions. Further, we establish convergence of the associated numerical discretization schemes for Riemann integrable input functions.</description>

      <title>Improved adjoint lattice Boltzmann method for topology optimization of laminar convective heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving flow-related inverse problems such as topology optimization problems is intricate but significant in various engineering fields. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the related adjoint method are highly suitable to perform sensitivity analysis in flow-related inverse problems thanks to their strong capability to handle complex structures and excellent parallel scalability. However, the current continuous adjoint LBM shows theoretical inconsistency and poor numerical stability for open flow systems. To solve these issues, the present work develops the fully consistent adjoint boundary conditions from the discrete adjoint LBM. For the first time, the gap between the two adjoint LBMs is unveiled by rigorously deriving both the continuous and discrete adjoint LBMs and comprehensively evaluating their numerical performances in the 2D and 3D pipe bend optimization cases. It is revealed that theoretical inconsistency or singularity exists in the continuous adjoint boundary conditions for open flow systems, corresponding to a much inferior numerical stability of the adjoint solution and an obvious numerical error in sensitivity. Fully consistent adjoint boundary conditions in elegant local form are derived from the discrete adjoint LBM in this work, which can always acquire exact sensitivity results and the theoretically highest numerical stability, with a 10 times higher Reynolds number (Re) achieved while without any increase of computational cost. 3D microchannel heat sinks under various Re are designed, and the esthetic and physically reasonable optimized designs are obtained under various parameter settings, demonstrating the necessity and versatility of the presented discrete adjoint LBM.</description>

      <title>Computing accurate eigenvalues using a mixed-precision Jacobi algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rounding error analysis of a mixed-precision preconditioned Jacobi algorithm, which uses low precision to compute the preconditioner, applies it at high precision (amounting to two matrix-matrix multiplications) and solves the eigenproblem using the Jacobi algorithm at working precision. Our analysis yields meaningfully smaller relative forward error bounds for the computed eigenvalues compared with those of the Jacobi algorithm. We further prove that, after preconditioning, if the off-diagonal entries of the preconditioned matrix are sufficiently small relative to its smallest diagonal entry, the relative forward error bound is independent of the condition number of the original matrix. We present two constructions for the preconditioner that exploit low precision, along with their error analyses. Our numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results and compare the relative forward error of the proposed algorithm with the Jacobi algorithm, a preconditioned Jacobi algorithm, and MATLAB's $\texttt{eig}$ function. Timings using Julia suggest that the dominant cost of obtaining this level of accuracy comes from the high precision matrix-matrix multiplies; if support in software or hardware for this were improved then this would become a negligible cost.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical approach for multicontinuum homogenization in high contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently developed upscaling technique, the multicontinuum homogenization method, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in modeling complex multiscale systems. This method defines multiple continua based on distinct physical properties and solves a series of constrained cell problems to capture localized information for each continuum. However, solving all these cell problems on very fine grids at every macroscopic point is computationally expensive, which is a common limitation of most homogenization approaches for non-periodic problems. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical multicontinuum homogenization framework. The core idea is to define hierarchical macroscopic points and solve the constrained problems on grids of varying resolutions. We assume that the local solutions can be represented as a combination of a linear interpolation of local solutions from preceding levels and an additional correction term. This combination is substituted into the original constrained problems, and the correction term is resolved using finite element (FE) grids of varying sizes, depending on the level of the macropoint. By normalizing the computational cost of fully resolving the local problem to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, we establish that our approach incurs a cost of $\mathcal{O}(L \eta^{(1-L)d})$, highlighting substantial computational savings across hierarchical layers $L$, coarsening factor $\eta$, and spatial dimension $d$. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in media with slowly varying properties, underscoring its potential for efficient multiscale modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MAGPIE (Multilevel-Adaptive-Guided Ptychographic Iterative Engine), a stochastic multigrid solver for the ptychographic phase-retrieval problem. The ptychographic phase-retrieval problem is inherently nonconvex and ill-posed. To address these challenges, we reformulate the original nonlinear and nonconvex inverse problem as the iterative minimization of a quadratic surrogate model that majorizes the original objective. This surrogate not only ensures favorable convergence properties but also generalizes the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE) family of algorithms. By solving the surrogate model using a multigrid method, MAGPIE achieves substantial gains in convergence speed and reconstruction quality over traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>A Budgeted Multi-Level Monte Carlo Method for Full Field Estimates of Multi-PDE Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high-performance budgeted multi-level Monte Carlo method for estimates on the entire spatial domain of multi-PDE problems with random input data. The method is designed to operate optimally within memory and CPU-time constraints and eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the problem's regularity and the algorithm's potential memory demand. To achieve this, we build on the budgeted multi-level Monte Carlo framework and enhance it with a sparse multi-index update algorithm operating on a dynamically assembled parallel data structure to enable estimates of the full field solution. We demonstrate numerically and provide mathematical proof that this update algorithm allows computing the full spatial domain estimates at the same CPU-time cost as a single quantity of interest, and that the maximum memory usage is similar to the memory demands of the deterministic formulation of the problem despite solving the stochastic formulation in parallel. We apply the method to a sequence of interlinked PDE problems, ranging from a stochastic partial differential equation for sampling random fields that serve as the diffusion coefficient in an elliptic subsurface flow problem, to a hyperbolic PDE describing mass transport in the resulting flux field.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Problem for Single Trajectories of Rough Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to develop a general framework for performing statistical inference for discretely observed random rough differential equations, our aim is to construct a geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ whose response $Y$, when driving a rough differential equation, matches the observed trajectory $y$. We call this the \textit{continuous inverse problem} and start by rigorously defining its solution. We then develop a framework where the solution can be constructed as a limit of solutions to appropriately designed \textit{discrete inverse problems}, so that convergence holds in $p$-variation. Our approach is based on calibrating the bounded variation paths whose limit defines the rough path `lift' of path $X$ to rough path ${\bf X}$ to the observed trajectory $y$. Moreover, we develop a general numerical algorithm for constructing the solution to the discrete inverse problem. The core idea of the algorithm is to use the signature representation of the path, iterating between the response and the control, each time correcting according to the required properties.
  We apply our framework to the case where the geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ is defined as the limit of piecewise linear paths in the $p$-variation topology. We express the discrete inverse problem for a fixed observation rate as a solution to a system of equations driven by piecewise linear paths and prove convergence to the solution of the continuous inverse problem for observation time $\delta\to 0$. Finally, we show that, in this context, the numerical algorithm for solving the discrete inverse problem simplifies to an iterative simultaneous update of the local gradients and we prove that it converges in $p$-variation uniformly with respect to $\delta$.</description>

Abstract: Many numerical simulation tools have been developed and are on the market, but there is still a strong need for appropriate tools capable of simulating multi-field problems, especially in aeroacoustics. Therefore, openCFS provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. Since 2000, the software has been developed continuously. The result is openCFS (before 2020, known as CFS++ Coupled Field Simulations written in C++). In this paper, we present pyCFS-data, a data processing framework written in Python to provide a flexible and easy-to-use toolbox to access and manipulate, pre- and postprocess data generated by or for usage with openCFS.</description>

In this context, key challenges include costly repeated evaluations of forward models, multimodality, and inaccessible gradients for the forward model. To address them, we develop a variational inference framework that combines Fisher-Rao natural gradient with specialized quadrature rules to enable derivative free updates of Gaussian mixture variational families. The resulting method, termed Derivative Free Gaussian Mixture Variational Inference (DF-GMVI), guarantees covariance positivity and affine invariance, offering a stable and efficient framework for approximating complex posterior distributions. The effectiveness of DF-GMVI is demonstrated through numerical experiments on challenging scenarios, including distributions with multiple modes, infinitely many modes, and curved modes in spaces with up to 100 dimensions. The method's practicality is further demonstrated in a large-scale application, where it successfully recovers the initial conditions of the Navier-Stokes equations from solution data at positive times.</description>
