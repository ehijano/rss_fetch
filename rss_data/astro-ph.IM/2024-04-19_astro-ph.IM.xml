      <title>Future Perspectives for Gamma-ray Burst Detection from Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their first discovery in the late 1960s, Gamma-ray bursts have attracted an exponentially growing interest from the international community due to their central role in the most highly debated open questions of the modern research of astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. These range from the intimate nuclear composition of high density material within the core of ultra-dense neuron stars, to stellar evolution via the collapse of massive stars, the production and propagation of gravitational waves, as well as the exploration of the early Universe by unveiling first stars and galaxies (assessing also their evolution and cosmic re-ionization). GRBs have stimulated in the past $\sim$50 years the development of cutting-edge technological instruments for observations of high energy celestial sources from space, leading to the launch and successful operations of many different scientific missions (several of them still in data taking mode nowadays). In this review, we provide a brief description of the GRB-dedicated missions from space being designed and developed for the future. The list of these projects, not meant to be exhaustive, shall serve as a reference to interested readers to understand what is likely to come next to lead the further development of GRB research and associated phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Modelling stochastic and quasi-periodic behaviour in stellar time-series: Gaussian process regression versus power-spectrum fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the hunt for an Earth-like exoplanets has intensified in recent years, so has the effort to characterise and model the stellar signals that can hide or mimic small planetary signals. Stellar variability arises from a number of sources, including granulation, supergranulation, oscillations and activity, all of which result in quasi-periodic or stochastic behaviour in photometric and/or radial velocity observations. Traditionally, the characterisation of these signals has mostly been done in the frequency domain. However, the recent development of scalable Gaussian process regression methods makes direct time-domain modelling of stochastic processes a feasible and arguably preferable alternative, obviating the need to estimate the power spectral density of the data before modelling it. In this paper, we compare the two approaches using a series of experiments on simulated data. We show that frequency domain modelling can lead to inaccurate results, especially when the time sampling is irregular. By contrast, Gaussian process regression results are often more precise, and systematically more accurate, in both the regular and irregular time sampling regimes. While this work was motivated by the analysis of radial velocity and photometry observations of main sequence stars in the context of planet searches, we note that our results may also have applications for the study of other types of astrophysical variability such as quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei variability.</description>

      <title>Searching for Free-Floating Planets with TESS: I. Discovery of a First Terrestrial-Mass Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though free-floating planets (FFPs) that have been ejected from their natal star systems may outpopulate their bound counterparts in the terrestrial-mass range, they remain one of the least explored exoplanet demographics. Due to their negligible electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths, the only observational technique able to detect these worlds is gravitational microlensing. Microlensing by terrestrial-mass FFPs induces rare, short-duration magnifications of background stars, requiring high-cadence, wide-field surveys to detect these events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), though designed to detect close-bound exoplanets via the transit technique, boasts a cadence as short as 200 seconds and has monitored hundreds of millions of stars, making it well-suited to search for short-duration microlensing events as well. We have used existing data products from the TESS Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP) to perform a preliminary search for FFP microlensing candidates in 1.3 million light curves from TESS Sector 61. We find one compelling candidate associated with TIC-107150013, a source star at $d_s = 3.194$ kpc. The event has a duration $t_E = 0.074^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ days and shows prominent finite-source features ($\rho = 4.55^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$), making it consistent with an FFP in the terrestrial-mass range. This exciting result indicates that our ongoing search through all TESS sectors has the opportunity to shed new light on this enigmatic population of worlds.</description>

      <title>The Fireball of November 24, 1970, as the Most Probable Source of the Ischgl Meteorite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In June 1976, a pristine meteorite stone weighing approximately 1 kg, fully covered with a fresh black fusion crust, was collected on a mountain road in the high-altitude Alpine environment. The recovery took place while clearing the remnants of a snow avalanche, 2 km northwest of Ischgl in Austria. Subsequent to its retrieval, the specimen remained in the finder's private residence without undergoing any scientific examination or identification until 2008, when it was brought to the University of Innsbruck. The sample was classified as a well-preserved LL6 chondrite, with a W0 weathering grade, implying a relatively short time between the meteorite fall and its retrieval. To investigate the potential connection between the Ischgl meteorite and a recorded fireball event, we have reviewed all documented fireballs ever photographed by German fireball camera stations. This examination led us to identify the fireball EN241170 observed in Germany by ten different European Network stations on the night of November 23/24, 1970, as the most likely candidate. We employed state-of-the-art techniques to reconstruct the fireball's trajectory, and to reproduce both its luminous and dark flight phases in detail. We find that the determined strewn field and the generated heat map closely align with the recovery location of the Ischgl meteorite. Furthermore, the measured radionuclide data reported here indicate that the pre-atmospheric size of the Ischgl meteoroid is consistent with the mass estimate inferred from our deceleration analysis along the trajectory. Our findings strongly support the conclusion that the Ischgl meteorite originated from the EN241170 fireball, effectively establishing it as a confirmed meteorite fall. This discovery enables to determine, along with the physical properties, also the heliocentric orbit and cosmic history of the Ischgl meteorite.</description>

      <title>Star-by-star dynamical evolution of the physical pair of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as an Extrasolar Planet Discovery and Characterization: Interior Structure and Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of radio emission from Jupiter was identified quickly as being due to its planetary-scale magnetic field. Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had large-scale magnetic fields. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the their magnetic fields are generated by dynamo processes within these planets, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. In the case of Jupiter, its magnetic field interacts with the moon Io to result in radio emission as well.
  Extrasolar planets reasonably may be expected to generate large-scale magnetic fields and to sustain an electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may these radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. Since the first edition of the Handbook, there have been a number of advances, albeit there remain no unambigous detection of radio emission from extrasolar planets. New ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the future.</description>

      <title>Prospects of the multi-channel photometric survey telescope in the cosmological application of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a real-time, three-color photometric system designed to capture the color evolution of stars and transients accurately. This telescope system can be crucial in cosmological distance measurements of low-redshift (low-$z$, $z$ $\lesssim 0.1$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). To optimize the capabilities of this instrument, we perform a comprehensive simulation study before its official operation is scheduled to start. By considering the impact of atmospheric extinction, weather conditions, and the lunar phase at the observing site involving the instrumental features, we simulate the light curves of SNe Ia obtained by the Mephisto. The best strategy in the case of SN Ia cosmology is to take the image at an exposure time of 130 s with a cadence of 3 days. In this condition, Mephisto can obtain hundreds of high-quality SNe Ia to achieve a distance measurement better than $4.5\%$. Given the on-time spectral classification and monitoring of the Lijiang 2.4 m Telescope at the same observatory, Mephisto, in the whole operation, can significantly enrich the well-calibrated sample of supernovae at low-$z$ and improve the calibration accuracy of high-$z$ SNe Ia.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exoplanet detection is the most exciting and challenging field of astronomy. The discovery of many exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems and has showed new ways to search for extra terrestrial life. In recent years, some primary methods of exoplanet detection like transit, radial velocity, gravitational microlensing, direct imaging and astrometry have played a important role for the discovery of exoplanets. In this paper we explored detection methodologies with all the implications and analytics of comparison between them. Here we also discussed on different machine learning algorithms for exoplanet detection and visualization. Finally, concluded with the significant discoveries made by some missions and their implications on our understanding for the properties, environmental conditions and importance of exoplanets in the universe.</description>
