      <title>A Universality Theorem for the Quantum Thermodynamics of Near-Extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the one-loop contribution from tensor modes to the thermodynamic entropy of near-extremal black holes is universal. Our proof applies to asymptotically flat, Anti-de-Sitter and de-Sitter black holes; it also covers spherical, axial and planar symmetries. We consider black hole configurations with and without matter sectors and explicitly discuss Abelian gauge fields and neutral scalar fields with arbitrary potential. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, the thermodynamics of near-extremal black holes contains a one-loop contribution from the tensor modes that equals $\frac{3}{2}\log (T_{\rm Hawking}/T_q)$. The proof of this theorem also shows explicitly how the Schwarzian modes appear universally in near-extremal geometries in dimensions four, five and six. We apply this theorem to Kerr-de-Sitter black holes as an explicit example.</description>

      <title>From Multipartite Entanglement to TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At long distances, a gapped phase of matter is described by a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). We conjecture a tight and concrete relationship between the genuine $(d+1)$-partite entanglement -- labelled by a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ -- in the ground state of a $(d-1)+1$-dimensional gapped theory and the partition function of the low energy TQFT on $M$. In particular, the conjecture implies that for $d=3$, the ground state wavefunction can determine the modular tensor category description of the low energy TQFT. We verify our conjecture for general (2+1)-dimensional Levin-Wen string-net models.</description>

      <title>Spectral Spacetime Entropy for Quasifree Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity to UV-regularise entanglement entropy, we present a spectral method for calculating the entropy of quasifree states, for both bosonic and fermionic field theories. This construction is defined in spacetime rather than on a hypersurface, enabling the covariant regularisation of entropies, and its calculation in generic spacetime regions. We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results. We also show a calculation in a causal set in $1+1$ dimensions which makes use of several of the unique and useful features of the formalism. In this last example, we obtain a novel result of a slightly modified entanglement entropy scaling coefficient, giving a possible signature of spacetime discreteness.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry and Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal theories are used to model a broad array of non-equilibrium phenomena found in nature ranging from biological systems like networks of neurons to the behavior of overflowing water fountains. This includes systems broadly classified as active matter systems. We show that the stochastic theories which describe nonreciprocal interactions can be mapped into quantum field theories described by a supersymmetric action with a single supercharge. The theories are generically non-Hermitian. This generalizes the past work of Parisi and Sourlas on reciprocal theories, which model systems with interactions derived from potentials.</description>

      <title>Solution to the Cosmological Constant Problem from Pre-geometric Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel solution to the cosmological constant (CC) problem that requires no fine-tunings nor anthropic reasoning. In pre-geometric gravity (PGG), spacetime emerges from the spontaneous breaking of a fundamental gauge symmetry. This mechanism dynamically generates general relativity while also revealing a deep connection: the topological Gauss-Bonnet coupling of the theory scales precisely as the de Sitter entropy, an enormous number which reflects the information content of our universe. This coupling acts as a gravitational $\theta$-angle parameter, forcing the CC to become quantized into discrete topological sectors. The symmetry-breaking dynamics naturally selects the sector corresponding to the observed vacuum energy. The selected vacuum state is stabilized by the extremely large potential barrier of the pre-geometric Higgs field, which effectively seals it off from quantum tunneling transitions to other topological sectors. The PGG framework thus provides a dynamical explanation for the smallness of the CC, linking gravity, topology and quantum information in a unified picture.</description>

      <title>Further Bounding the Kreuzer-Skarke Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batyrev's construction provides a map from fine, regular, star triangulations (FRSTs) of 4D reflexive polytopes to smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds (CYs). We prove that there are at most $10^{296}$ diffeomorphism classes of CYs produced in this manner, improving [1]'s upper bound of $10^{428}$. To show this, we make use of the fact that any two FRSTs with the same 2-face restrictions give rise to diffeomorphic CYs and bound the number of such '2-face equivalence classes' for all polytopes with Hodge number $h^{1,1} \geq 300$. We also put a lower bound of $10^{276}$ on the number of 2-face equivalence classes, but emphasize that this is not a lower bound on the number of diffeomorphism classes of CYs, as distinct 2-face equivalence classes may give rise to diffeomorphic threefolds.</description>

      <title>Signum-Gordon spectral mass from nonlinear Fourier mode mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of mass in the Signum-Gordon (SG) model, a nonlinear field theory with a non-analytic potential where the perturbative mass is undefined. Using two complementary numerical methods, we map the field's dispersion relation (amplitude vs. wavenumber and frequency). We find the field's evolution depends critically on the product of its amplitude and squared wavenumber, revealing a massless regime at large values and an ultra-massive regime with dominant nonlinear Fourier mode mixing near unity. By comparing the resulting dispersion map to the massive Klein-Gordon equation, we introduce a spectral mass. We demonstrate that a specific input amplitude value induces a spectral mass of unity, effectively characterizing the massive-like behavior arising from the initial wave configuration.</description>

      <title>Tensor extension of the Abelian-Higgs model for a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Abelian-Higgs model of superconductivity to incorporate higher-spin particles. Microscopically, these higher-spin states can be modeled as multi-electron clusters, such as spin-1 Copper pairs or quartets, existing alongside the standard Cooper pairs predicted by BCS theory. To account for these composites, we introduce vector and higher-rank tensor non-gauge fields into the Lagrangian, which serve as sources for higher-rank tensor gauge fields. In this work, we extend the particle spectrum by one rank (including the necessary auxiliary fields) and examine the resulting modifications to the fundamental phenomenological parameters of superconductivity, specifically the penetration depth and the correlation length.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric quantum mechanics from wrapped D4-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a large class of holographic solutions describing D4-branes wrapped on 4-manifolds $\mathcal{M}_4$ with constant curvature leading to gravity duals of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in the IR via twisted compactifications. The manifolds $\mathcal{M}_4$ considered here are four-dimensional spheres and hyperbolic spaces, products of two Riemann surfaces, and Kahler four-cycles. The solutions are obtained from the maximal gauged supergravity in six dimensions with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^4$ gauge groups. These gauged supergravities can be embedded in type IIA theory via consistent truncations on $H^{p,q}\times \mathbb{R}^{5-p-q}$ and $H^{p,q}\times\mathbb{R}^{4-p-q}\times S^1$, respectively. The solutions take the form of $t\times \mathcal{M}_4$-sliced domain walls interpolating between locally flat domain walls and singular geometries in the IR. Upon uplifted to type IIA theory, many solutions admit physical IR singularities and could holographically describe supersymmetric quantum mechanics arising from twisted compactifications of D4-branes on $\mathcal{M}_4$.</description>

      <title>Highest-weight truncation, graded EFT structure, and renormalization of black hole Love numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static tidal Love numbers of four-dimensional black holes vanish identically, unlike their nontrivial dynamical response at finite frequency. Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group flow of $O(N)^3$-invariant general sextic tensor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the beta functions for the $O(N)^3$-invariant general sextic tensor model up to cubic order in the coupling constant, and at leading order in the $1/N$ expansion. Our method is a direct, explicit one, in the sense that we identify the appropriate Feynman graphs, we compute their amplitudes which then allows us to obtain the $\beta$ functions of the model. We perform these computation considering both a long-range and a short-range propagator, within the dimensional regularization framework. We find three fixed points in the short-range case and a line of fixed points, parameterized by the wheel interaction, in the long-range case. This line of fixed points is identical to the one found in the case of the $U(N)^3$-invariant model. Our result proves that the additional $O(N)^3$-invariant interactions do not modify the long-range fixed point structure of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational data in cosmology indicate a small, positive, and nonvanishing cosmological constant that dominates the energy budget of the present universe. The origin of the cosmological constant from a quantum perspective remains unresolved, with a discrepancy of approximately 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and theoretical estimates. Motivated by earlier work of Gibbons, we analyze the cosmological constant problem within a quantum-gravitational framework based on Schwarzian theory and its ensemble averaging. We then derive the phenomenological value of the dark energy density and obtain the corresponding equation of state. In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we evaluate one-loop all-plus gluon amplitudes of $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ fundamental fermions in the presence of a flavour instanton background. Fermion zero modes are regulated with a chiral mass term. This computation is performed by cancelling a twistorial 't Hooft anomaly via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We find that the trace-ordered amplitude has the form of a Parke-Taylor factor multiplied by the Fourier transform of the instanton density evaluated on the total momentum of the gluons. A background flavour instanton modifies the leading soft gluon and photon theorem, generating a level equal to twice the instanton charge in the soft Kac-Moody symmetry. We discuss the implications of our results for amplitudes in the presence of dynamical instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed points of the 2d renormalization group flow are known to correspond to tree level string vacua. We discuss how the renormalization group (or "sigma model") approach can be extended to the string loop level. The central role of the condition of renormalizability of the generating functional for string amplitudes with respect to both "local" and "modular" infinities is emphasized. Several one-loop and two-loop examples of renormalization are considered. It is found that in order to ensure the renormalizability of the generating functional one is to use an "extended" (Schottky-type) parametrization of the moduli space. An approach to resummation of the string perturbative expansion based on operators of insertion of topological fixtures is suggested.</description>

      <title>3D Gravity and Chaos in CFTs with Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure 3d gravity in AdS is believed to admit a holographic description in terms of 2d CFT. We introduce a theory of fermionic 3d gravity where we sum over geometries equipped with spin structure, and propose it is holographically described by fermionic 2d CFT data. We evaluate the leading contributions to the gravity path integral with one and two torus boundaries, extracting both the spectrum and its spectral statistics from the torus wormhole. Strikingly, the theory has fermionic black hole microstates, even in the absence of bulk fermionic matter. We then incorporate subtle bulk topological field theories, classified by appropriate cobordism groups, and evaluate the one and two-boundary torus partition functions. The spectral statistics we derive from gravity are shown, in all cases, to be consistent with the pattern of anomalies expected from classifications of fermionic 2d CFT. We also define a version of RMT$_2$, a random-matrix framework compatible with the symmetries of 2d CFTs, which naturally accommodates fermionic spectra and reproduces our gravitational results across all cases we analyze.</description>

      <title>The State-Operator Clifford Compatibility: A Real Algebraic Framework for Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Pauli-Clifford connection to introduce a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for $N$-qubit quantum computation based on the tensor product structure $C\ell_{2,0}(\mathbb{R})^{\otimes N}$. In this setting the bivector $J = e_{12}$ satisfies $J^{2} = -1$ and supplies the complex structure on a minimal left ideal via right-multiplication, while Pauli operations arise as left actions of suitable Clifford elements. Adopting a canonical stabilizer mapping, the $N$-qubit computational basis state $|0\cdots 0\rangle$ is represented natively by a tensor product of real algebraic idempotents. This structural choice leads to a State-Operator Clifford Compatibility law that is stable under the geometric product for $N$ qubits and aligns symbolic Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution on the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Fan-Wang type regular black holes in Quasi-Topological Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive static spherically symmetric regular black holes as vacuum solutions to purely gravitational theories in four dimensions. To that end, we construct four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities starting from subclasses of two-dimensional Horndeski actions. By construction, these theories possess second-order equations of motion on spherically symmetric backgrounds. We show that a subset of these non-polynomial gravities, referred to as non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities, admit single-function static spherically symmetric solutions whereby the metric function is determined by an algebraic equation. Solutions to these theories include the Hayward regular black-hole spacetime, for which a corresponding gravitational action is stated explicitly.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy spectra and skin effect via boundary conditions in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral properties, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, often influenced by boundary conditions. The modulation of these phenomena by generalized boundary conditions remains unexplored and not understood. Here, we analyze the Hatano-Nelson model with generalized boundary conditions induced by complex hopping amplitudes at the boundary. Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Rescuing Overabundant Dark Matter with a Strongly First Order Phase Transition in the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dark sector consisting of fermionic dark matter (DM) charged under a broken dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry, interacting with the Standard Model through kinetic mixing. In such models, the DM annihilation cross section is typically suppressed by the small kinetic mixing and or a heavy mediator, often leading to an overabundant relic density. We show that the observed DM abundance can be achieved if the dark Higgs undergoes a strong first order phase transition after DM freeze-out. In this scenario, the relic abundance is set by thermal freeze-out in the symmetric phase and subsequently reduced by entropy injection from the phase transition, rather than by annihilation in the broken phase. We find that to reproduce the observed relic abundance, the required phase transition is generically supercooled. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal lies within the sensitivity of future experiments, providing a complementary probe of this framework. Moreover, a strongly supercooled phase transition can potentially account for the NANOGrav signal for DM masses below $O(10)$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: We explore the multimetric theory of gravitation, also known as multigravity. We derive additional new exact solutions for the theory in proportional Kerr-Schild and double Kerr-Schild forms. We extend several solutions from the theory of General Relativity, characterized by a constant Ricci scalar in single and double Kerr-Schild forms, to derive solutions in the multi-gravity context. We also examine and extend the classical double copy relations that can be constructed out from these solutions in multigravity exploring the dynamics of the single copy and zero copy fields.</description>

      <title>The empirical laws for Majorana fields in a curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a sequel to our previous paper (arXiv:2511.12311), where we considered the conceptual problem on the empirical laws for the Klein\textendash Gordon quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), and we will consider the similar problems for the Majorana field on curved spacetime here. A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Decay Rate and Greybody Factors for Regular Black Holes with Scalar Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of asymptotically flat regular black holes supported by a phantom scalar field with a scalar charge $A$. This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Possible existence of super Chandrasekhar mass limit in the matter-curvature coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate white dwarfs in the framework of f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity to explore the Chandrasekhar Limit. We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\,\mathrm{M}_\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\,\mathrm{M}_\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (\rho_c &gt; 10^{10}\, \mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield \Gamma &gt; 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a common local spin equilibrium for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles is incorporated into a thermal model of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. We show that an effective spin polarization tensor leading to a correct description of the longitudinal spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons simultaneously yields a positive alignment of vector mesons ($\phi$ and $K^{*0}$) that grows monotonically with transverse momentum and centrality. Similar trends can be seen in the data, suggesting a possible common mechanism for longitudinal spin polarization and alignment. However, model calculations are insufficient to explain the data in a fully quantitative way. The correlation found between the magnitude of the $\Lambda$ longitudinal polarization and vector meson alignment suggests further more elaborate investigations of this issue.</description>

      <title>Novel (Non-)Accelerating Vacuum Spacetimes from Bertotti--Robinson Black Holes via Harrison and Inversion Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations generated from electrovacuum configurations embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds. Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--Garc\'ia black hole as the seed.</description>

      <title>Planckian bound on the local equilibration time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local equilibration time $\tau_{\rm eq}$ of quantum many-body systems is conjectured to be bounded below by the Planckian time $\hbar /T$. We formalize this conjecture by defining $\tau_{\rm eq}$ as the time scale at which a hydrodynamic description emerges for conserved densities. Drawing on analytic properties of real time thermal correlators, we establish a rigorous lower bound $\tau_{\rm eq} \geq \alpha \hbar /T$ on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a `regulated' thermal two-point function. The dimensionless coefficient $\alpha $ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details. This bound applies universally to local quantum many-body systems, with or without a quasiparticle description, including in the presence of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid for Coulomb interacting generalized Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n&gt;1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational implications of black holes in toroidal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and observational implications for the charged torus-like black holes, a class of solutions distinct from the classical Schwarzschild black holes. We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and R\`{e}nyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their $S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Exact Mutual Information Difference: Scalar vs. Maxwell Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute, for any R\'enyi index $n$, the exact difference between the mutual R\'enyi informations of a pair of free massless scalars and that of a Maxwell field in $d=4$ dimensions. Using the standard dimensional reduction method in polar coordinates, the problem is mapped to that of a single scalar field in $d=2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which in turn can be conveniently related to the algebra of a chiral current on the full line. This latter identification, which maps algebras on an interval to two-interval algebras, yields exact results that clarify the structure of the long-distance OPE perturbative expansion of the mutual information. We find that this series has a finite radius of convergence only for integer $n&gt;1$, while it becomes only asymptotical for $n=1$ and general non-integer values of $n$.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Spectral Curve for $\text{AdS}_3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^1$ strings and the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$ Q-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we put forward and discuss a proposal for a Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) describing the planar spectrum of the holographic CFT dual to strings on AdS$_3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^1$, a theory with global symmetry $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)^{\oplus 2}$. We focus mainly on the case when the radii of the two spheres are the same, i.e. $\alpha = 1/2$, where the symmetry reduces to $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, our proposal is based on two copies of an $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$ Q-system, glued through the branch cuts of the Q-functions in a minimal way. We study in detail the ensuing analytic properties of the Q-functions in this proposal.
  Focusing on purely massive excitations, we consider the large worldsheet limit in which the QSC leads to a set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) equations, yielding strong constraints on the (so-far unfixed) dressing factors of the worldsheet S-matrix.
  In a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric sector, our proposal is consistent with all previous results on the worldsheet S-matrix. However, in the non-symmetric case, we found a subtle incompatibility between the analytic constraints arising from the proposed QSC, the crossing equations present in the literature, and braiding unitarity.
  We discuss possible explanations for this mismatch: either our minimal QSC proposal does not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or the crossing unitarity equations receive a nontrivial correction that needs to be understood.
  Finally, we also propose a generalisation of the Q-system for the case of $\alpha\neq 1/2$, corresponding to the superalgebra $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$. This novel algebraic structure represents a significant step towards understanding the Quantum Spectral Curve of the entire theory.</description>

      <title>Classifying Fibers and Bases in Toric Hypersurface Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a complete analysis of the toric elliptic and genus-one fibrations of all 474 million reflexive polytopes in the Kreuzer-Skarke database. Earlier work with Huang showed that all but 29,223 of these polytopes have such a fibration. We identify 2,264,992,252 distinct fibrations, and determine the fiber and base structure in each case; after accounting for automorphisms of the ambient polytope, these fibrations furnish 2,250,744,657 equivalence classes. We summarize generic features and identify exotic special cases among these fibrations. These fibrations illustrate many features that have been explored in the context of 6D F-theory, including gauge groups hosted on non-toric divisors, automatic enhancement of gauge groups, and implicit non-toric bases and high-rank 6D SCFTs associated with nonflat fibers, as well as novel geometric features such as singular bases for genus-one fibrations with multisections. This analysis illustrates the power of elliptic and genus-one fibrations, and the geometro-physical language of F-theory as a tool for understanding the structure of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops in ABJM theory reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new technique for computing supersymmetric Wilson loops in the ABJM theory via supersymmetric localization, valid for arbitrary values of the rank of the gauge group $N$ and the Chern-Simons level $k$. The approach relies on an operator representation of the Wilson loops within the Fermi gas formalism in terms of the resolvent of a certain integral operator previously encountered in the computation of the ABJM partition function on the round three-sphere. By deriving a set of nontrivial relations for this resolvent, we obtain exact expressions for the generating functions of Wilson loops in terms of the partition function. For large $k$, these expressions reproduce the weak-coupling expansion of the Wilson loops, and in the large-$N$ limit at fixed $k$ they match previously obtained high-precision numerical results. This analysis also resolves the longstanding discrepancy between numerical data and the semiclassical expression for the $1/6$ BPS Wilson loop.</description>

      <title>Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regime of gravity has recently emerged as a fertile framework for exploring holography, non-Lorentzian symmetries, and geometric limit of General Relativity. In this letter, we establish the presence of a non-vanishing torsion within three-dimensional Carrollian gravity by constructing the Carrollian Mielke-Baekler (C-MB) gravity theory in its Chern-Simons formulation, obtained as the ultra-relativistic limit of the relativistic Mielke-Baekler model. The resulting C-MB theory features non-zero temporal torsion and curvature, together with spatial curvature, providing the most general three-dimensional Carrollian gravity model with these properties. Temporal torsion affects non-affinity of null generators and boundary dynamics. Several known ultra-relativistic gravity theories arise as particular limits of this framework, highlighting its unifying character.</description>

      <title>Generalized Virial Identities: Radial Constraints for Solitons, Instantons, and Bounces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $\alpha$ that controls the radial weighting. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $\alpha$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $\alpha$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $\alpha$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $\alpha$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $\alpha$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a large number of exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with heavy matter particles that generalize the construction of Antonini, Sasieta, and Swingle (AS${}^2$), argued to define CFT states dual to a spacetime with a closed baby universe cosmology. Our construction starts with an arbitrary heavy-particle closed universe cosmology of the type constructed in arXiv:2503.12227, and via a gluing procedure adds an arbitrary number of AdS tubes connecting the past and future conformal boundaries of the associated Euclidean wormhole solution. With our construction, it is straightforward to produce examples where the cosmology is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. We describe a necessary condition for the cosmological wormhole saddle to dominate the Euclidean path integral with the specified boundary conditions. We argue that the original AS${}^2$ construction usually does not meet this condition, and describe alternative saddles that are likely to dominate. We discuss various possibilities for how the cosmological saddle might be made to dominate in our generalized construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Hilbert series of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=3$ quiver gauge theories by taking a specific limit of the superconformal index. Our approach introduces auxiliary fugacities associated with symmetries which, while not present in the full theory, arise as effective symmetries on specific branches of the moduli space. By evaluating the index in a limit governed by these parameters, we successfully isolate the Hilbert series of the desired branches. We validate our results against the literature and provide several new extensions. We focus primarily on linear and circular quivers with unitary gauge groups, which originate from Type IIB brane configurations involving generic $(p,q)$ fivebranes. We further generalise this approach to star-shaped and orthosymplectic $\mathcal{N}=3$ quivers. Finally, we investigate the geometric branches of affine Dynkin quivers, demonstrating agreement with known results, while offering new predictions for unexplored cases.</description>

Abstract: Supersymmetric localization reduces the computation of protected observables in ABJM theory to finite-dimensional matrix integrals. Building on the techniques introduced in arXiv:2512.02119, we develop a bootstrap framework for the systematic calculation of instanton corrections to the free energy and to supersymmetric Wilson loops. Exploiting exact functional relations and consistency conditions satisfied by grand-canonical observables, in the Fermi-gas formulation of the ABJM matrix model, we provide analytic derivations of several relations for the free energy that were previously known only conjecturally, either from refined topological string theory or from high-precision numerical studies. We apply the same framework to determine the nonperturbative corrections to $1/2$ and $1/6$ BPS Wilson loops, elucidating their qualitative differences and uncovering novel structural features of the instanton effects. These results further highlight the intricate nonperturbative structure and network of dualities underlying ABJM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Chiral Anomaly in Spin-1 Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral anomaly is a key feature of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories: in presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields, the number of massless Weyl fermions of a given chirality is not conserved. In condensed matter, emergent chiral fermions in Weyl semimetals exhibit the same anomaly, directly tied to the topological charge of the Weyl node, ensuring a quantized anomaly coefficient. However, many condensed matter systems break Lorentz symmetry while retaining topological nodes, raising the question of how chiral anomaly manifests in such settings. In this work, we investigate this question in spin-1 fermionic systems and show that the conventional anomaly equation is modified by an additional nontopological contribution, leading to a nonquantized anomaly coefficient. This surprising result arises because spin-1 fermions can be decomposed into 2-flavor Weyl fermions coupled to a Lorentz-breaking, momentum-dependent non-Abelian background potential. The interplay between this potential and external electromagnetic fields generates the extra term in the anomaly equation. Our framework naturally generalizes to other Lorentz-breaking systems beyond the spin-1 case.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as long period transients after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study, via perturbative methods, the rates of production of $W$ bosons emitted in neutrino decays during the early stages of the Universe. We compute the transition amplitude corresponding to the first order of de Sitter electroweak perturbation theory and study its various limiting cases. The transition rates are derived using minimal subtraction and dimensional regularization. In the end we attempt to obtain the density number of $W$ bosons produced in perturbative transitions in de Sitter spacetime, using the rates obtained in this paper and in previous ones, and analyze the density number with respect to the particle momenta and renormalisation mass $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Moduli of stable supermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by a Deligne-Mumford superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects in an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamic matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a static and time-varying magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Self-regularized entropy: What does black hole entropy predict for tests of Kerr no-hair theorem?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick-wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a in a quantum black hole model whose strong-field exterior is modeled phenomenologically, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static q-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. WKB counting of trapped near-horizon cavity modes shows that, within the perturbative small-deformation regime studied here, a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy becomes finite without an ad hoc cutoff. Adopting the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as external thermodynamic inputs, matching this canonical entropy to that benchmark yields an entropy-motivated deformation scale which, when interpreted phenomenologically in a stationary extension, corresponds to percent-to-tens-of-percent violations of the Kerr multipole relations, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and planned third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Ruffini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 (2025) 8, 081403] pointed out that the repetitive Penrose process cannot drain the entire extractable energy of a Kerr black hole. In this Letter, we alternatively point out the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole cannot drop down to exactly zero via the repetitive electric Penrose process that is terminated after a finite number of iterative steps, indicating a new thermodynamical third-law analog for the repetitive electric Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resolvent Singularities and the Infrared Structure of Linearized Gravit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a sharp geometric threshold governing the infrared spectral behavior of the spatial Lichnerowicz operator on asymptotically flat three--dimensional manifolds. Let $(M,g)$ be asymptotically flat and let $L=\Delta_L$ denote the spatial Lichnerowicz operator acting on symmetric $2$--tensors. Assume \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \lesssim r(x)^{-p} \quad \text{as } r(x)\to\infty . \]
  If $p&gt;3$, curvature is spectrally short--range: $L$ exhibits regular low--energy scattering and zero energy is not singular. At the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-3}, \] dispersion and curvature balance. Zero enters the essential spectrum and the weighted resolvent develops a threshold singularity. For $s\in(1/2,1)$, \[ \|\langle r\rangle^{-s}(L-i\varepsilon)^{-1}\langle r\rangle^{-s}\| \gtrsim \varepsilon^{-(1-s)} \quad \text{as } \varepsilon \downarrow 0 . \] Thus the limiting absorption principle fails at zero energy.
  This singularity provides a spatial spectral mechanism for the infrared sector of linearized gravity. The same inverse--cube scaling governs long--range correlations, irregular low--frequency scattering, and soft gravitational modes. Numerical simulations of a radial model and the full tensor operator confirm that $p=3$ marks a sharp transition between negligible and marginal curvature.
  The associated branch point at zero energy determines late--time relaxation, yielding the universal tail exponent \[ t^{-(2\ell+3)}, \] a spectral consequence of nonzero ADM mass. More generally, in $d$ spatial dimensions the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-d} \] forms a universal boundary for curvature--coupled Laplace--type operators, encoding the infrared structure of gravity in the spectral geometry of a Cauchy slice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs) that incorporate a minimal length through generic momentum-dependent deformation functions. We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Pad\'e expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $\phi^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $\phi^4$ theory, the resulting two point Pad\'e approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Pad\'e appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.</description>
