      <title>HPC-AI Coupling Methodology for Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have fundamentally transformed numerical-based high-performance computing (HPC) applications with data-driven approaches and endeavored to address existing challenges, e.g. high computational intensity, in various scientific domains. In this study, we explore the scenarios of coupling HPC and AI (HPC-AI) in the context of emerging scientific applications, presenting a novel methodology that incorporates three patterns of coupling: surrogate, directive, and coordinate. Each pattern exemplifies a distinct coupling strategy, AI-driven prerequisite, and typical HPC-AI ensembles. Through case studies in materials science, we demonstrate the application and effectiveness of these patterns. The study highlights technical challenges, performance improvements, and implementation details, providing insight into promising perspectives of HPC-AI coupling. The proposed coupling patterns are applicable not only to materials science but also to other scientific domains, offering valuable guidance for future HPC-AI ensembles in scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI in Product Management: A Co-Evolutionary Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores agentic AI's transformative role in product management, proposing a conceptual co-evolutionary framework to guide its integration across the product lifecycle. Agentic AI, characterized by autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and multi-agent collaboration, redefines product managers (PMs) as orchestrators of socio-technical ecosystems. Using systems theory, co-evolutionary theory, and human-AI interaction theory, the framework maps agentic AI capabilities in discovery, scoping, business case development, development, testing, and launch. An integrative review of 70+ sources, including case studies from leading tech firms, highlights PMs' evolving roles in AI orchestration, supervision, and strategic alignment. Findings emphasize mutual adaptation between PMs and AI, requiring skills in AI literacy, governance, and systems thinking. Addressing gaps in traditional frameworks, this study provides a foundation for future research and practical implementation to ensure responsible, effective agentic AI integration in software organizations.</description>

      <title>Spatially Distributed Wettability Characterization in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enhanced geometric algorithm for automated pore-by-pore contact angle measurement from micro-CT images, is presented that achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods through robust fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interface extrapolation. Using this high resolution data, we generate spatially distributed contact angle maps that reveal previously hidden wettability heterogeneity. Our analysis of mixed-wet systems demonstrates the severe limitations of averaged metrics: a sample with a mean contact angle of 64.7 degrees, conventionally classified as uniformly weakly water-wet, exhibits 40% of its pore space in the intermediate-wetting regime (70-110 degrees). This heterogeneity explains the presence of minimal surface interfaces and fundamentally different pore-filling mechanisms operating within the same sample. By providing open-source tools for spatially-resolved wettability characterization, this work enables more accurate predictions of multiphase flow behavior in heterogeneous porous materials, essential for optimizing subsurface energy storage and recovery processes.</description>

      <title>A modified Levenberg-Marquardt method for estimating the elastic material parameters of polymer waveguides using residuals between autocorrelated frequency responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we address the estimation of the frequency-dependent elastic parameters of polymers in the ultrasound range, which is formulated as an inverse problem. This inverse problem is implemented as a nonlinear regression-type optimization problem, in which the simulation signals are fitted to the measurement signals. These signals consist of displacement responses in waveguides, focusing on hollow cylindrical geometries to enhance the simulation efficiency. To accelerate the optimization and reduce the number of model evaluations and wait times, we propose two novel methods. First, we introduce an adaptation of the Levenberg-Marquardt method derived from a geometrical interpretation of the least-squares optimization problem. Second, we introduce an improved objective function based on the autocorrelated envelopes of the measurement and simulation signals. Given that this study primarily relies on simulation data to quantify optimization convergence, we aggregate the expected ranges of realistic material parameters and derive their distributions to ensure the reproducibility of optimizations with proper measurements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our objective function modification and step adaptation for various materials with isotropic material symmetry by comparing them with a state-of-the-art optimization method. In all cases, our method reduces the total number of model evaluations, thereby shortening the time to identify the material parameters.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Constitutive Model Calibration: Leveraging the Power of Full-Field DIC Measurements and In-Situ Load Path Selection for Reliable Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07310v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate material characterization and model calibration are essential for computationally-supported engineering decisions. Current characterization and calibration methods (1) use simplified test specimen geometries and global data, (2) cannot guarantee that sufficient characterization data is collected for a specific model of interest, (3) use deterministic methods that provide best-fit parameter values with no uncertainty quantification, and (4) are sequential, inflexible, and time-consuming. This work brings together several recent advancements into an improved workflow called Interlaced Characterization and Calibration that advances the state-of-the-art in constitutive model calibration. The ICC paradigm (1) efficiently uses full-field data to calibrate a high-fidelity material model, (2) aligns the data needed with the data collected with an optimal experimental design protocol, (3) quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and (4) incorporates these advances into a quasi real-time feedback loop. The ICC framework is demonstrated on the calibration of a material model using simulated full-field data for an aluminum cruciform specimen being deformed bi-axially. The cruciform is actively driven through the myopically optimal load path using Bayesian optimal experimental design, which selects load steps that yield the maximum expected information gain. To aid in numerical stability and preserve computational resources, the full-field data is dimensionally reduced via principal component analysis, and fast surrogate models which approximate the input-output relationships of the expensive finite element model are used. The tools demonstrated here show that high-fidelity constitutive models can be efficiently and reliably calibrated with quantified uncertainty, thus supporting credible decision-making and potentially increasing the agility of solid mechanics modeling.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filter for Data Assimilation coupled with low-resolution computations techniques applied in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Reduced-Order Model (ROM) for merging experimental and simulation data using Data Assimilation (DA) to estimate the "True" state of a fluid dynamics system, leading to more accurate predictions. Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.</description>

      <title>Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02572v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Co-design of magnetic soft robots with large deformation and contacts via material point method and topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic soft robots embedded with hard magnetic particles enable untethered actuation via external magnetic fields, offering remote, rapid, and precise control, which is highly promising for biomedical applications. However, designing such systems is challenging due to the complex interplay of magneto-elastic dynamics, large deformation, solid contacts, time-varying stimuli, and posture-dependent loading. As a result, most existing research relies on heuristics and trial-and-error methods or focuses on the independent design of stimuli or structures under static conditions. We propose a topology optimization framework for magnetic soft robots that simultaneously designs structures, location-specific material magnetization and time-varying magnetic stimuli, accounting for large deformations, dynamic motion, and solid contacts. This is achieved by integrating generalized topology optimization with the magneto-elastic material point method, which supports GPU-accelerated parallel simulations and auto-differentiation for sensitivity analysis. We applied this framework to design magnetic robots for various tasks, including multi-task shape morphing and locomotion, in both 2D and 3D. The method autonomously generates optimized robotic systems to achieve target behaviors without requiring human intervention. Despite the nonlinear physics and large design space, it demonstrates high computational efficiency, completing all cases within minutes. The framework provides a computational foundation for the autonomous co-design of active soft materials in applications such as metasurfaces, drug delivery, and minimally invasive procedures.</description>
