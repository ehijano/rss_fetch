      <title>Body Discovery of Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI), the importance of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly apparent. Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Magnetically and Electrically Powered Metallo-Dielectric Janus Microrobots: Enhanced Motion Control and Operation Beyond Planar Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the integration of hybrid magnetic and electric actuation mechanisms to achieve advanced motion capabilities for Janus particle (JP) microrobots. We demonstrate enhanced in-plane motion control through versatile control strategies and present the concepts of interplanar transitions and 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) trajectories, enabled by magnetic levitation and electrostatic trapping. These innovations expand the mobility of JPs into 3D space, allowing dynamic operation beyond the limitations of traditional surface-bound motion. Key functionalities include obstacle crossing, transitions to elevated surfaces, and discrete surface patterning enabling highly localized interventions. Using this set of tools, we also showcase the controlled out-of-plane transport of both synthetic and biological cargo. Together, these advancements lay the groundwork for novel microrobot-related applications in microfluidic systems and biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.</description>

      <title>Learning Scene-Level Signed Directional Distance Function with Ellipsoidal Priors and Neural Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense geometric environment representations are critical for autonomous mobile robot navigation and exploration. Recent work shows that implicit continuous representations of occupancy, signed distance, or radiance learned using neural networks offer advantages in reconstruction fidelity, efficiency, and differentiability over explicit discrete representations based on meshes, point clouds, and voxels. In this work, we explore a directional formulation of signed distance, called signed directional distance function (SDDF). Unlike signed distance function (SDF) and similar to neural radiance fields (NeRF), SDDF has a position and viewing direction as input. Like SDF and unlike NeRF, SDDF directly provides distance to the observed surface along the direction, rather than integrating along the view ray, allowing efficient view synthesis. To learn and predict scene-level SDDF efficiently, we develop a differentiable hybrid representation that combines explicit ellipsoid priors and implicit neural residuals. This approach allows the model to effectively handle large distance discontinuities around obstacle boundaries while preserving the ability for dense high-fidelity prediction. We show that SDDF is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural implicit scene models in terms of reconstruction accuracy and rendering efficiency, while allowing differentiable view prediction for robot trajectory optimization.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth Allocation for Cloud-Augmented Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) control systems increasingly rely on ML models for tasks such as perception and planning. Current practice is to run these models on the car's local hardware due to real-time latency constraints and reliability concerns, which limits model size and thus accuracy. Prior work has observed that we could augment current systems by running larger models in the cloud, relying on faster cloud runtimes to offset the cellular network latency. However, prior work does not account for an important practical constraint: limited cellular bandwidth. We show that, for typical bandwidth levels, proposed techniques for cloud-augmented AV models take too long to transfer data, thus mostly falling back to the on-car models and resulting in no accuracy improvement.
  In this work, we show that realizing cloud-augmented AV models requires intelligent use of this scarce bandwidth, i.e. carefully allocating bandwidth across tasks and providing multiple data compression and model options. We formulate this as a resource allocation problem to maximize car utility, and present our system \sysname which achieves an increase in average model accuracy by up to 15 percentage points on driving scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset.</description>

      <title>DRPA-MPPI: Dynamic Repulsive Potential Augmented MPPI for Reactive Navigation in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive mobile robot navigation in unstructured environments is challenging when robots encounter unexpected obstacles that invalidate previously planned trajectories. Model predictive path integral control (MPPI) enables reactive planning, but still suffers from limited prediction horizons that lead to local minima traps near obstacles. Current solutions rely on heuristic cost design or scenario-specific pre-training, which often limits their adaptability to new environments. We introduce dynamic repulsive potential augmented MPPI (DRPA-MPPI), which dynamically detects potential entrapments on the predicted trajectories. Upon detecting local minima, DRPA-MPPI automatically switches between standard goal-oriented optimization and a modified cost function that generates repulsive forces away from local minima. Comprehensive testing in simulated obstacle-rich environments confirms DRPA-MPPI's superior navigation performance and safety compared to conventional methods with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Learning Adaptive Dexterous Grasping from Single Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can robots learn dexterous grasping skills efficiently and apply them adaptively based on user instructions? This work tackles two key challenges: efficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and context-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that learns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill and selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To improve sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides reinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while allowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration, we employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations to enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill based on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level intent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings, showing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables learning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a real-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects, significantly outperforming the baseline.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Fencing Framework for Safe and Efficient Collaborative Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative robots (cobots) increasingly operate alongside humans, demanding robust real-time safeguarding. Current safety standards (e.g., ISO 10218, ANSI/RIA 15.06, ISO/TS 15066) require risk assessments but offer limited guidance for real-time responses. We propose a virtual fencing approach that detects and predicts human motion, ensuring safe cobot operation. Safety and performance tradeoffs are modeled as an optimization problem and solved via sequential quadratic programming. Experimental validation shows that our method minimizes operational pauses while maintaining safety, providing a modular solution for human-robot collaboration.</description>

      <title>LGR: LLM-Guided Ranking of Frontiers for Object Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (OGN) is a fundamental task for robots and AI, with key applications such as mobile robot image databases (MRID). In particular, mapless OGN is essential in scenarios involving unknown or dynamic environments. This study aims to enhance recent modular mapless OGN systems by leveraging the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we address the challenge of determining the visiting order in frontier-based exploration by framing it as a frontier ranking problem. Our approach is grounded in recent findings that, while LLMs cannot determine the absolute value of a frontier, they excel at evaluating the relative value between multiple frontiers viewed within a single image using the view image as context. We dynamically manage the frontier list by adding and removing elements, using an LLM as a ranking model. The ranking results are represented as reciprocal rank vectors, which are ideal for multi-view, multi-query information fusion. We validate the effectiveness of our method through evaluations in Habitat-Sim.</description>

      <title>Turning Circle-based Control Barrier Function for Efficient Collision Avoidance of Nonholonomic Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new control barrier function (CBF) designed to improve the efficiency of collision avoidance for nonholonomic vehicles. Traditional CBFs typically rely on the shortest Euclidean distance to obstacles, overlooking the limited heading change ability of nonholonomic vehicles. This often leads to abrupt maneuvers and excessive speed reductions, which is not desirable and reduces the efficiency of collision avoidance. Our approach addresses these limitations by incorporating the distance to the turning circle, considering the vehicle's limited maneuverability imposed by its nonholonomic constraints. The proposed CBF is integrated with model predictive control (MPC) to generate more efficient trajectories compared to existing methods that rely solely on Euclidean distance-based CBFs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on unicycle vehicles and experiments with underactuated surface vehicles.</description>

      <title>CTS-CBS: A New Approach for Multi-Agent Collaborative Task Sequencing and Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a generalization problem of Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), called Collaborative Task Sequencing - Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CTS-MAPF), where agents must plan collision-free paths and visit a series of intermediate task locations in a specific order before reaching their final destinations. To address this problem, we propose a new approach, Collaborative Task Sequencing - Conflict-Based Search (CTS-CBS), which conducts a two-level search. In the high level, it generates a search forest, where each tree corresponds to a joint task sequence derived from the jTSP solution. In the low level, CTS-CBS performs constrained single-agent path planning to generate paths for each agent while adhering to high-level constraints. We also provide heoretical guarantees of its completeness and optimality (or sub-optimality with a bounded parameter). To evaluate the performance of CTS-CBS, we create two datasets, CTS-MAPF and MG-MAPF, and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results show that CTS-CBS adaptations for MG-MAPF outperform baseline algorithms in terms of success rate (up to 20 times larger) and runtime (up to 100 times faster), with less than a 10% sacrifice in solution quality. Furthermore, CTS-CBS offers flexibility by allowing users to adjust the sub-optimality bound omega to balance between solution quality and efficiency. Finally, practical robot tests demonstrate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MoLe-VLA: Dynamic Layer-skipping Vision Language Action Model via Mixture-of-Layers for Efficient Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</description>

      <title>Decremental Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most, if not all, robot navigation systems employ a decomposed planning framework that includes global and local planning. To trade-off onboard computation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics considerations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely simplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without dynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based on either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between the two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may not be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained obstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel paradigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints into the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics modeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning progresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three different planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We also develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in the simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical experiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers multi-goal motion planning in unstructured, obstacle-rich environments where a robot is required to reach multiple regions while avoiding collisions. The planned motions must also satisfy the differential constraints imposed by the robot dynamics. To find solutions efficiently, this paper leverages machine learning, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and sampling-based motion planning. The approach expands a motion tree by adding collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories as branches. A TSP solver is used to compute a tour for each node to determine the order in which to reach the remaining goals by utilizing a cost matrix. An important aspect of the approach is that it leverages machine learning to construct the cost matrix by combining runtime and distance predictions to single-goal motion-planning problems. During the motion-tree expansion, priority is given to nodes associated with low-cost tours. Experiments with a vehicle model operating in obstacle-rich environments demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the approach.</description>

      <title>Safety integrity framework for automated driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the comprehensive safety framework that underpinned the development, release process, and regulatory approval of BMW's first SAE Level 3 Automated Driving System. The framework combines established qualitative and quantitative methods from the fields of Systems Engineering, Engineering Risk Analysis, Bayesian Data Analysis, Design of Experiments, and Statistical Learning in a novel manner. The approach systematically minimizes the risks associated with hardware and software faults, performance limitations, and insufficient specifications to an acceptable level that achieves a Positive Risk Balance. At the core of the framework is the systematic identification and quantification of uncertainties associated with hazard scenarios and the redundantly designed system based on designed experiments, field data, and expert knowledge. The residual risk of the system is then estimated through Stochastic Simulation and evaluated by Sensitivity Analysis. By integrating these advanced analytical techniques into the V-Model, the framework fulfills, unifies, and complements existing automotive safety standards. It therefore provides a comprehensive, rigorous, and transparent safety assurance process for the development and deployment of Automated Driving Systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Flower Cluster Matching Using The Unscented Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring flowers over time is essential for precision robotic pollination in agriculture. To accomplish this, a continuous spatial-temporal observation of plant growth can be done using stationary RGB-D cameras. However, image registration becomes a serious challenge due to changes in the visual appearance of the plant caused by the pollination process and occlusions from growth and camera angles. Plants flower in a manner that produces distinct clusters on branches. This paper presents a method for matching flower clusters using descriptors generated from RGB-D data and considers allowing for spatial uncertainty within the cluster. The proposed approach leverages the Unscented Transform to efficiently estimate plant descriptor uncertainty tolerances, enabling a robust image-registration process despite temporal changes. The Unscented Transform is used to handle the nonlinear transformations by propagating the uncertainty of flower positions to determine the variations in the descriptor domain. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the Unscented Transform results, confirming our method's effectiveness for flower cluster matching. Therefore, it can facilitate improved robotics pollination in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Toward Dynamic Control of Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots using Clarke Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic model and control framework for tendon-driven continuum robots with multiple segments and an arbitrary number of tendons per segment. Our approach leverages the Clarke transform, the Euler-Lagrange formalism, and the piecewise constant curvature assumption to formulate a dynamic model on a two-dimensional manifold embedded in the joint space that inherently satisfies tendon constraints. We present linear controllers that operate directly on this manifold, along with practical methods for preventing negative tendon forces without compromising control fidelity. We validate these approaches in simulation and on a physical prototype with one segment and five tendons, demonstrating accurate dynamic behavior and robust trajectory tracking under real-time conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Visuals: Investigating Force Feedback in Extended Reality for Robot Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores how force feedback affects various aspects of robot data collection within the Extended Reality (XR) setting. Force feedback has been proved to enhance the user experience in Extended Reality (XR) by providing contact-rich information. However, its impact on robot data collection has not received much attention in the robotics community. This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting an extensive user study on the effects of force feedback during data collection in XR. We extended two XR-based robot control interfaces, Kinesthetic Teaching and Motion Controllers, with haptic feedback features. The user study is conducted using manipulation tasks ranging from simple pick-place to complex peg assemble, requiring precise operations. The evaluations show that force feedback enhances task performance and user experience, particularly in tasks requiring high-precision manipulation. These improvements vary depending on the robot control interface and task complexity. This paper provides new insights into how different factors influence the impact of force feedback.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Coordination Under Physical Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is fundamental to various applications, including autonomous exploration, search and rescue, and cooperative transportation. This paper presents an optimal consensus framework for multi-robot systems (MRSs) that ensures efficient rendezvous while minimizing energy consumption and addressing actuator constraints. A critical challenge in real-world deployments is actuator limitations, particularly wheel velocity saturation, which can significantly degrade control performance. To address this issue, we incorporate Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) into the control design, facilitating constrained optimization while ensuring system stability and feasibility. The resulting optimal control policy effectively balances coordination efficiency and energy consumption, even in the presence of actuation constraints. The proposed framework is validated through extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments conducted using a team of Robotarium mobile robots. The experimental results confirm that our control strategies achieve reliable and efficient coordinated rendezvous while addressing real-world challenges such as communication delays, sensor noise, and packet loss.</description>

      <title>Flying Vines: Design, Modeling, and Control of a Soft Aerial Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial robotic arms aim to enable inspection and environment interaction in otherwise hard-to-reach areas from the air. However, many aerial manipulators feature bulky or heavy robot manipulators mounted to large, high-payload aerial vehicles. Instead, we propose an aerial robotic arm with low mass and a small stowed configuration called a "flying vine". The flying vine consists of a small, maneuverable quadrotor equipped with a soft, growing, inflated beam as the arm. This soft robot arm is underactuated, and positioning of the end effector is achieved by controlling the coupled quadrotor-vine dynamics. In this work, we present the flying vine design and a modeling and control framework for tracking desired end effector trajectories. The dynamic model leverages data-driven modeling methods and introduces bilinear interpolation to account for time-varying dynamic parameters. We use trajectory optimization to plan quadrotor controls that produce desired end effector motions. Experimental results on a physical prototype demonstrate that our framework enables the flying vine to perform high-speed end effector tracking, laying a foundation for performing dynamic maneuvers with soft aerial manipulators.</description>

      <title>Hyperdimensional Uncertainty Quantification for Multimodal Uncertainty Fusion in Autonomous Vehicles Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models deployed in real-world autonomous systems. However, existing approaches typically quantify task-level output prediction uncertainty without considering epistemic uncertainty at the multimodal feature fusion level, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Additionally, popular uncertainty quantification methods, e.g., Bayesian approximations, remain challenging to deploy in practice due to high computational costs in training and inference. In this paper, we propose HyperDUM, a novel deterministic uncertainty method (DUM) that efficiently quantifies feature-level epistemic uncertainty by leveraging hyperdimensional computing. Our method captures the channel and spatial uncertainties through channel and patch -wise projection and bundling techniques respectively. Multimodal sensor features are then adaptively weighted to mitigate uncertainty propagation and improve feature fusion. Our evaluations show that HyperDUM on average outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms by up to 2.01%/1.27% in 3D Object Detection and up to 1.29% improvement over baselines in semantic segmentation tasks under various types of uncertainties. Notably, HyperDUM requires 2.36x less Floating Point Operations and up to 38.30x less parameters than SOTA methods, providing an efficient solution for real-world autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Extendable Long-Horizon Planning via Hierarchical Multiscale Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles a novel problem, extendable long-horizon planning-enabling agents to plan trajectories longer than those in training data without compounding errors. To tackle this, we propose the Hierarchical Multiscale Diffuser (HM-Diffuser) and Progressive Trajectory Extension (PTE), an augmentation method that iteratively generates longer trajectories by stitching shorter ones. HM-Diffuser trains on these extended trajectories using a hierarchical structure, efficiently handling tasks across multiple temporal scales. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive Plan Pondering and the Recursive HM-Diffuser, which consolidate hierarchical layers into a single model to process temporal scales recursively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing diffusion-based planners for scalable long-horizon planning.</description>

      <title>Direct Post-Training Preference Alignment for Multi-Agent Motion Generation Models Using Implicit Feedback from Pre-training Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have revolutionized motion generation models in embodied applications. While LLM-type auto-regressive motion generation models benefit from training scalability, there remains a discrepancy between their token prediction objectives and human preferences. As a result, models pre-trained solely with token-prediction objectives often generate behaviors that deviate from what humans would prefer, making post-training preference alignment crucial for producing human-preferred motions. Unfortunately, post-training alignment requires extensive preference rankings of motions generated by the pre-trained model, which are costly to annotate, especially in multi-agent settings. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging pre-training demonstrations to scalably generate preference data for post-training alignment. However, these methods often adopt an adversarial assumption, treating all pre-trained model-generated samples as unpreferred examples. This adversarial approach overlooks the valuable signal provided by preference rankings among the model's own generations, ultimately reducing alignment effectiveness and potentially leading to misaligned behaviors. In this work, instead of treating all generated samples as equally bad, we leverage implicit preferences encoded in pre-training demonstrations to construct preference rankings among the pre-trained model's generations, offering more nuanced preference alignment guidance with zero human cost. We apply our approach to large-scale traffic simulation and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the realism of pre-trained model's generated behaviors, making a lightweight 1M motion generation model comparable to SOTA large imitation-based models by relying solely on implicit feedback from pre-training demonstrations, without additional post-training human preference annotations or high computational costs.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with Discrete Diffusion Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skills have been introduced to offline reinforcement learning (RL) as temporal abstractions to tackle complex, long-horizon tasks, promoting consistent behavior and enabling meaningful exploration. While skills in offline RL are predominantly modeled within a continuous latent space, the potential of discrete skill spaces remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a compact discrete skill space for offline RL tasks supported by state-of-the-art transformer-based encoder and diffusion-based decoder. Coupled with a high-level policy trained via offline RL techniques, our method establishes a hierarchical RL framework where the trained diffusion decoder plays a pivotal role. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm, Discrete Diffusion Skill (DDS), is a powerful offline RL method. DDS performs competitively on Locomotion and Kitchen tasks and excels on long-horizon tasks, achieving at least a 12 percent improvement on AntMaze-v2 benchmarks compared to existing offline RL approaches. Furthermore, DDS offers improved interpretability, training stability, and online exploration compared to previous skill-based methods.</description>

      <title>SARGes: Semantically Aligned Reliable Gesture Generation via Intent Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation enhances human-computer interaction realism through speech-synchronized gesture synthesis. However, generating semantically meaningful gestures remains a challenging problem. We propose SARGes, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse speech content and generate reliable semantic gesture labels, which subsequently guide the synthesis of meaningful co-speech gestures.First, we constructed a comprehensive co-speech gesture ethogram and developed an LLM-based intent chain reasoning mechanism that systematically parses and decomposes gesture semantics into structured inference steps following ethogram criteria, effectively guiding LLMs to generate context-aware gesture labels. Subsequently, we constructed an intent chain-annotated text-to-gesture label dataset and trained a lightweight gesture label generation model, which then guides the generation of credible and semantically coherent co-speech gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that SARGes achieves highly semantically-aligned gesture labeling (50.2% accuracy) with efficient single-pass inference (0.4 seconds). The proposed method provides an interpretable intent reasoning pathway for semantic gesture synthesis.</description>

      <title>Reasoning and Learning a Perceptual Metric for Self-Training of Reflective Objects in Bin-Picking with a Low-cost Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bin-picking of metal objects using low-cost RGB-D cameras often suffers from sparse depth information and reflective surface textures, leading to errors and the need for manual labeling. To reduce human intervention, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of a metric learning stage and a self-training stage. Specifically, to automatically process data captured by a low-cost camera (LC), we introduce a Multi-object Pose Reasoning (MoPR) algorithm that optimizes pose hypotheses under depth, collision, and boundary constraints. To further refine pose candidates, we adopt a Symmetry-aware Lie-group based Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (SaL-BGMM), integrated with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, for symmetry-aware filtering. Additionally, we propose a Weighted Ranking Information Noise Contrastive Estimation (WR-InfoNCE) loss to enable the LC to learn a perceptual metric from reconstructed data, supporting self-training on untrained or even unseen objects. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on both the ROBI dataset and our newly introduced Self-ROBI dataset.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-to-Real Self-supervised Robust Depth Estimation via Learning with Motion and Structure Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised depth estimation from monocular cameras in diverse outdoor conditions, such as daytime, rain, and nighttime, is challenging due to the difficulty of learning universal representations and the severe lack of labeled real-world adverse data. Previous methods either rely on synthetic inputs and pseudo-depth labels or directly apply daytime strategies to adverse conditions, resulting in suboptimal results. In this paper, we present the first synthetic-to-real robust depth estimation framework, incorporating motion and structure priors to capture real-world knowledge effectively. In the synthetic adaptation, we transfer motion-structure knowledge inside cost volumes for better robust representation, using a frozen daytime model to train a depth estimator in synthetic adverse conditions. In the innovative real adaptation, which targets to fix synthetic-real gaps, models trained earlier identify the weather-insensitive regions with a designed consistency-reweighting strategy to emphasize valid pseudo-labels. We introduce a new regularization by gathering explicit depth distributions to constrain the model when facing real-world data. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art across diverse conditions in multi-frame and single-frame evaluations. We achieve improvements of 7.5% and 4.3% in AbsRel and RMSE on average for nuScenes and Robotcar datasets (daytime, nighttime, rain). In zero-shot evaluation of DrivingStereo (rain, fog), our method generalizes better than the previous ones.</description>

      <title>Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Robotic Embodiment and Empathetic Tone of LLMs on Empathy Elicitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the elicitation of empathy toward a third party through interaction with social agents. Participants engaged with either a physical robot or a voice-enabled chatbot, both driven by a large language model (LLM) programmed to exhibit either an empathetic tone or remain neutral. The interaction is focused on a fictional character, Katie Banks, who is in a challenging situation and in need of financial donations. The willingness to help Katie, measured by the number of hours participants were willing to volunteer, along with their perceptions of the agent, were assessed for 60 participants. Results indicate that neither robotic embodiment nor empathetic tone significantly influenced participants' willingness to volunteer. While the LLM effectively simulated human empathy, fostering genuine empathetic responses in participants proved challenging.</description>

      <title>GAIA-2: A Controllable Multi-View Generative World Model for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models offer a scalable and flexible paradigm for simulating complex environments, yet current approaches fall short in addressing the domain-specific requirements of autonomous driving - such as multi-agent interactions, fine-grained control, and multi-camera consistency. We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems. Videos are available at https://wayve.ai/thinking/gaia-2.</description>

      <title>Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search-Based Testing of Autonomous Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing autonomous robotic systems, such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles, is challenging due to their interaction with highly unpredictable environments. A common practice is to first conduct simulation-based testing, which, despite reducing real-world risks, remains time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the vast space of possible test scenarios. A number of search-based approaches were proposed to generate test scenarios more efficiently. A key aspect of any search-based test generation approach is the choice of representation used during the search process. However, existing methods for improving test scenario representation remain limited. We propose RILaST (Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search-Based Testing) approach, which enhances test representation by mapping it to the latent space of a variational autoencoder. We evaluate RILaST on two use cases, including autonomous drone and autonomous lane-keeping assist system. The obtained results show that RILaST allows finding between 3 to 4.6 times more failures than baseline approaches, achieving a high level of test diversity.</description>

      <title>Immersive and Wearable Thermal Rendering for Augmented Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In augmented reality (AR), where digital content is overlaid onto the real world, realistic thermal feedback has been shown to enhance immersion. Yet current thermal feedback devices, heavily influenced by the needs of virtual reality, often hinder physical interactions and are ineffective for immersion in AR. To bridge this gap, we have identified three design considerations relevant for AR thermal feedback: indirect feedback to maintain dexterity, thermal passthrough to preserve real-world temperature perception, and spatiotemporal rendering for dynamic sensations. We then created a unique and innovative thermal feedback device that satisfies these criteria. Human subject experiments assessing perceptual sensitivity, object temperature matching, spatial pattern recognition, and moving thermal stimuli demonstrated the impact of our design, enabling realistic temperature discrimination, virtual object perception, and enhanced immersion. These findings demonstrate that carefully designed thermal feedback systems can bridge the sensory gap between physical and virtual interactions, enhancing AR realism and usability.</description>

      <title>Vision-based Multi-future Trajectory Prediction: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based trajectory prediction is an important task that supports safe and intelligent behaviours in autonomous systems. Many advanced approaches have been proposed over the years with improved spatial and temporal feature extraction. However, human behaviour is naturally diverse and uncertain. Given the past trajectory and surrounding environment information, an agent can have multiple plausible trajectories in the future. To tackle this problem, an essential task named multi-future trajectory prediction (MTP) has recently been studied. This task aims to generate a diverse, acceptable and explainable distribution of future predictions for each agent. In this paper, we present the first survey for MTP with our unique taxonomies and a comprehensive analysis of frameworks, datasets and evaluation metrics. We also compare models on existing MTP datasets and conduct experiments on the ForkingPath dataset. Finally, we discuss multiple future directions that can help researchers develop novel multi-future trajectory prediction systems and other diverse learning tasks similar to MTP.</description>

      <title>AO-Grasp: Articulated Object Grasp Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AO-Grasp, a grasp proposal method that generates 6 DoF grasps that enable robots to interact with articulated objects, such as opening and closing cabinets and appliances. AO-Grasp consists of two main contributions: the AO-Grasp Model and the AO-Grasp Dataset. Given a segmented partial point cloud of a single articulated object, the AO-Grasp Model predicts the best grasp points on the object with an Actionable Grasp Point Predictor. Then, it finds corresponding grasp orientations for each of these points, resulting in stable and actionable grasp proposals. We train the AO-Grasp Model on our new AO-Grasp Dataset, which contains 78K actionable parallel-jaw grasps on synthetic articulated objects. In simulation, AO-Grasp achieves a 45.0 % grasp success rate, whereas the highest performing baseline achieves a 35.0% success rate. Additionally, we evaluate AO-Grasp on 120 real-world scenes of objects with varied geometries, articulation axes, and joint states, where AO-Grasp produces successful grasps on 67.5% of scenes, while the baseline only produces successful grasps on 33.3% of scenes. To the best of our knowledge, AO-Grasp is the first method for generating 6 DoF grasps on articulated objects directly from partial point clouds without requiring part detection or hand-designed grasp heuristics.

      <description>arXiv:2406.00312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can we localize a robot on a map only using monocular vision? This study presents NuRF, an adaptive and nudged particle filter framework in radiance fields for 6-DoF robot visual localization. NuRF leverages recent advancements in radiance fields and visual place recognition. Conventional visual place recognition meets the challenges of data sparsity and artifact-induced inaccuracies. By utilizing radiance field-generated novel views, NuRF enhances visual localization performance and combines coarse global localization with the fine-grained pose tracking of a particle filter, ensuring continuous and precise localization. Experimentally, our method converges 7 times faster than existing Monte Carlo-based methods and achieves localization accuracy within 1 meter, offering an efficient and resilient solution for indoor visual localization.</description>

      <title>ManiCM: Real-time 3D Diffusion Policy via Consistency Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been verified to be effective in generating complex distributions from natural images to motion trajectories. Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</description>

      <title>Distributed Motion Control of Multiple Mobile Manipulators for Reducing Interaction Wrench in Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world cooperative manipulation of objects, multiple mobile manipulator systems may suffer from disturbances and asynchrony, leading to excessive interaction wrenches and potentially causing object damage or emergency stops. Existing methods often rely on torque control and dynamic models, which are uncommon in many industrial robots and settings. Additionally, dynamic models often neglect joint friction forces and are not accurate. These methods are challenging to implement and validate in physical systems. To address the problems, this paper presents a novel distributed motion control approach aimed at reducing these unnecessary interaction wrenches. The control law is only based on local information and joint velocity control to enhance practical applicability. The communication delays within the distributed architecture are considered. The stability of the control law is rigorously proven by the Lyapunov theorem. In the simulations, the effectiveness is shown, and the impact of communication graph connectivity and communication delays has been studied. A comparison with other methods shows the advantages of the proposed control law in terms of convergence speed and robustness. Finally, the control law has been validated in physical experiments. It does not require dynamic modeling or torque control, and thus is more user-friendly for physical robots.</description>

      <title>General-purpose Clothes Manipulation with Semantic Keypoints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clothes manipulation is a critical capability for household robots; yet, existing methods are often confined to specific tasks, such as folding or flattening, due to the complex high-dimensional geometry of deformable fabric. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP) for general-purpose clothes manipulation, which enables the robot to perform diverse manipulation tasks over different types of clothes. The key idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., "right shoulder", "left sleeve", etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be effectively extracted from depth images and are sufficient to represent a broad range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP leverages semantic keypoints to bridge LLM-powered task planning and low-level action execution in a two-level hierarchy. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms baseline methods across diverse clothes types in both seen and unseen tasks. Further, experiments with a Kinova dual-arm system on four distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's performance on a real robot.</description>

Abstract: Shortest-path roadmaps, also known as reduced visibility graphs, provides a highly efficient multi-query method for computing optimal paths in two-dimensional environments. Combined with Minkowski sum computations, shortest-path roadmaps can compute optimal paths for a translating robot in 2D. In this study, we explore the intuitive idea of stacking up a set of reduced visibility graphs at different orientations for a polygonal holonomic robot to support the fast computation of near-optimal paths, allowing simultaneous 2D translation and rotation. The resulting algorithm, rotation-stacked visibility graph (RVG), is shown to be resolution-complete and asymptotically optimal. Extensive computational experiments show RVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-query sampling-based methods on both computation time and solution optimality fronts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LiDAR point cloud maps are extensively utilized on roads for robot navigation due to their high consistency. However, dense point clouds face challenges of high memory consumption and reduced maintainability for long-term operations. In this study, we introduce SLIM, a scalable and lightweight mapping system for long-term LiDAR mapping in urban environments. The system begins by parameterizing structural point clouds into lines and planes. These lightweight and structural representations meet the requirements of map merging, pose graph optimization, and bundle adjustment, ensuring incremental management and local consistency. For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, HeLiPR and M2DGR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization. Finally, with multi-session LiDAR data, the SLIM system provides a globally consistent map with low memory consumption (~130 KB/km on KITTI).</description>

      <title>Reactive Collision Avoidance for Safe Agile Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reactive collision avoidance is essential for agile robots navigating complex and dynamic environments, enabling real-time obstacle response. However, this task is inherently challenging because it requires a tight integration of perception, planning, and control, which traditional methods often handle separately, resulting in compounded errors and delays. This paper introduces a novel approach that unifies these tasks into a single reactive framework using solely onboard sensing and computing. Our method combines nonlinear model predictive control with adaptive control barrier functions, directly linking perception-driven constraints to real-time planning and control. Constraints are determined by using a neural network to refine noisy RGB-D data, enhancing depth accuracy, and selecting points with the minimum time-to-collision to prioritize the most immediate threats. To maintain a balance between safety and agility, a heuristic dynamically adjusts the optimization process, preventing overconstraints in real time. Extensive experiments with an agile quadrotor demonstrate effective collision avoidance across diverse indoor and outdoor environments, without requiring environment-specific tuning or explicit mapping.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Self-Supervised Terrain Awareness for Off-Road Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrain awareness is an essential milestone to enable truly autonomous off-road navigation. Accurately predicting terrain characteristics allows optimizing a vehicle's path against potential hazards. Recent methods use deep neural networks to predict traversability-related terrain properties in a self-supervised manner, relying on proprioception as a training signal. However, onboard cameras are inherently limited by their point-of-view relative to the ground, suffering from occlusions and vanishing pixel density with distance. This paper introduces a novel approach for self-supervised terrain characterization using an aerial perspective from a hovering drone. We capture terrain-aligned images while sampling the environment with a ground vehicle, effectively training a simple predictor for vibrations, bumpiness, and energy consumption. Our dataset includes 2.8 km of off-road data collected in forest environment, comprising 13 484 ground-based images and 12 935 aerial images. Our findings show that drone imagery improves terrain property prediction by 21.37 % on the whole dataset and 37.35 % in high vegetation, compared to ground robot images. We conduct ablation studies to identify the main causes of these performance improvements. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach by scouting an unseen area with a drone, planning and executing an optimized path on the ground.</description>

      <title>FoAM: Foresight-Augmented Multi-Task Imitation Policy for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task imitation learning (MTIL) has shown significant potential in robotic manipulation by enabling agents to perform various tasks using a single policy. This simplifies the policy deployment and enhances the agent's adaptability across different scenarios. However, key challenges remain, such as maintaining action reliability (e.g., avoiding abnormal action sequences that deviate from nominal task trajectories) and generalizing to unseen tasks with a few expert demonstrations. To address these challenges, we introduce the Foresight-Augmented Manipulation Policy (FoAM), a novel MTIL policy that pioneers the use of multi-modal goal condition as input and introduces a foresight augmentation in addition to the general action reconstruction. FoAM enables the agent to reason about the visual consequences (states) of its actions and learn more expressive embedding that captures nuanced task variations. Extensive experiments on over 100 tasks in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that FoAM significantly enhances MTIL policy performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 41% in success rate. Meanwhile, we released our simulation suites, including a total of 10 scenarios and over 80 challenging tasks designed for manipulation policy training and evaluation.

Abstract: Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</description>

      <title>Perception of Emotions in Human and Robot Faces: Is the Eye Region Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increased interest in developing next-gen social robots has raised questions about the factors affecting the perception of robot emotions. This study investigates the impact of robot appearances (humanlike, mechanical) and face regions (full-face, eye-region) on human perception of robot emotions. A between-subjects user study (N = 305) was conducted where participants were asked to identify the emotions being displayed in videos of robot faces, as well as a human baseline. Our findings reveal three important insights for effective social robot face design in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI): Firstly, robots equipped with a back-projected, fully animated face - regardless of whether they are more human-like or more mechanical-looking - demonstrate a capacity for emotional expression comparable to that of humans. Secondly, the recognition accuracy of emotional expressions in both humans and robots declines when only the eye region is visible. Lastly, within the constraint of only the eye region being visible, robots with more human-like features significantly enhance emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Physics-ML Modeling for Marine Vehicle Maneuvering Motions in the Presence of Environmental Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid physics-machine learning modeling framework is proposed for the surface vehicles' maneuvering motions to address the modeling capability and stability in the presence of environmental disturbances. From a deep learning perspective, the framework is based on a variant version of residual networks with additional feature extraction. Initially, an imperfect physical model is derived and identified to capture the fundamental hydrodynamic characteristics of marine vehicles. This model is then integrated with a feedforward network through a residual block. Additionally, feature extraction from trigonometric transformations is employed in the machine learning component to account for the periodic influence of currents and waves. The proposed method is evaluated using real navigational data from the 'JH7500' unmanned surface vehicle. The results demonstrate the robust generalizability and accurate long-term prediction capabilities of the nonlinear dynamic model in specific environmental conditions. This approach has the potential to be extended and applied to develop a comprehensive high-fidelity simulator.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Policy Steering through Human Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative policies trained with human demonstrations can autonomously accomplish multimodal, long-horizon tasks. However, during inference, humans are often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guide a pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape among multiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To better align policy output with human intent without inducing out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS) framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift.

      <title>DexHandDiff: Interaction-aware Diffusion Planning for Adaptive Dexterous Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simple manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, object relocation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexHandDiff's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves an average of 70.7% success rate on goal adaptive dexterous tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>OTTER: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Text-Aware Visual Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to predict robotic actions based on visual observations and language instructions. Existing approaches require fine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language features are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the pre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture that leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual feature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER selectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are semantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer. This allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen. Thereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned from large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly outperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization to novel objects and environments.

      <title>The Morphology-Control Trade-Off: Insights into Soft Robotic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robotics holds transformative potential for enabling adaptive and adaptable systems in dynamic environments. However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.</description>

      <title>LaMOuR: Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

      <title>TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, such as concurrent actions between two agents when there are no conflicting conditions, without significant modification and definition to existing PDDL domains. A human expert aware of such constraints can decompose a goal into subgoals, each reachable through single agent planning, to take advantage of simultaneous actions. In contrast to classical planning, large language models (LLMs) directly used for inferring plan steps rarely guarantee execution success, but are capable of leveraging commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of both classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone, as well as most multiagent plans, while guaranteeing execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals result in similar multi-agent execution lengths to those specified by human experts.

      <title>Socratic Planner: Self-QA-Based Zero-Shot Planning for Embodied Instruction Following</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is the task of executing natural language instructions by navigating and interacting with objects in interactive environments. A key challenge in EIF is compositional task planning, typically addressed through supervised learning or few-shot in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, a self-QA-based zero-shot planning method that infers an appropriate plan without any further training. The Socratic Planner first facilitates self-questioning and answering by the Large Language Model (LLM), which in turn helps generate a sequence of subgoals. While executing the subgoals, an embodied agent may encounter unexpected situations, such as unforeseen obstacles. The Socratic Planner then adjusts plans based on dense visual feedback through a visually-grounded re-planning mechanism. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, outperforming current state-of-the-art planning models on the ALFRED benchmark across all metrics, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks that demand complex inference. We further demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on a physical robot for long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>TopV-Nav: Unlocking the Top-View Spatial Reasoning Potential of MLLM for Zero-shot Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON) task requires embodied agents to find a previously unseen object by navigating in unfamiliar environments. Such a goal-oriented exploration heavily relies on the ability to perceive, understand, and reason based on the spatial information of the environment. However, current LLM-based approaches convert visual observations to language descriptions and reason in the linguistic space, leading to the loss of spatial information. In this paper, we introduce TopV-Nav, an MLLM-based method that directly reasons on the top-view map with sufficient spatial information. To fully unlock the MLLM's spatial reasoning potential in top-view perspective, we propose the Adaptive Visual Prompt Generation (AVPG) method to adaptively construct semantically-rich top-view map. It enables the agent to directly utilize spatial information contained in the top-view map to conduct thorough reasoning. Besides, we design a Dynamic Map Scaling (DMS) mechanism to dynamically zoom top-view map at preferred scales, enhancing local fine-grained reasoning. Additionally, we devise a Potential Target Driven (PTD) mechanism to predict and to utilize target locations, facilitating global and human-like exploration. Experiments on MP3D and HM3D datasets demonstrate the superiority of our TopV-Nav.</description>

      <title>RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>Contractive Dynamical Imitation Policies for Efficient Out-of-Sample Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a data-driven approach to learning policies from expert behavior, but it is prone to unreliable outcomes in out-of-sample (OOS) regions. While previous research relying on stable dynamical systems guarantees convergence to a desired state, it often overlooks transient behavior. We propose a framework for learning policies modeled by contractive dynamical systems, ensuring that all policy rollouts converge regardless of perturbations, and in turn, enable efficient OOS recovery. By leveraging recurrent equilibrium networks and coupling layers, the policy structure guarantees contractivity for any parameter choice, which facilitates unconstrained optimization. We also provide theoretical upper bounds for worst-case and expected loss to rigorously establish the reliability of our method in deployment. Empirically, we demonstrate substantial OOS performance improvements for simulated robotic manipulation and navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n = 30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming. Video available at https://youtu.be/83kWr8zUFIQ.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for quantifying uncertainty and information gained within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) through P-Optimality. While 3D-GS has proven to be a useful world model with high-quality rasterizations, it does not natively quantify uncertainty or information, posing a challenge for real-world applications such as 3D-GS SLAM. We propose to quantify information gain in 3D-GS by reformulating the problem through the lens of optimal experimental design, which is a classical solution widely used in literature. By restructuring information quantification of 3D-GS through optimal experimental design, we arrive at multiple solutions, of which T-Optimality and D-Optimality perform the best quantitatively and qualitatively as measured on two popular datasets. Additionally, we propose a block diagonal covariance approximation which provides a measure of correlation at the expense of a greater computation cost.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the latest research on feasible space monitoring of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) as well as polytopic collision avoidance, this paper studies the Polytope Volume Monitoring (PVM) problem, whose goal is to design a control law for inputs of nonlinear systems to prevent the volume of some state-dependent polytope from decreasing to zero. Recent studies have explored the idea of applying Chebyshev ball method in optimization theory to solve the case study of PVM; however, the underlying difficulties caused by nonsmoothness have not been addressed. This paper continues the study on this topic, where our main contribution is to establish the relationship between nonsmooth CBF and parametric optimization theory through directional derivatives for the first time, so as to solve PVM problems more conveniently. In detail, inspired by Chebyshev ball approach, a parametric linear program (PLP) based nonsmooth barrier function candidate is established for PVM, and then, sufficient conditions for it to be a nonsmooth CBF are proposed, based on which a quadratic program (QP) based safety filter with guaranteed feasibility is proposed to address PVM problems. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed safety filter.</description>
