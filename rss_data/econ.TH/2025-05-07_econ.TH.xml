      <title>Allocation of Heterogeneous Resources in General Lotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allocation of resources plays an important role in the completion of system objectives and tasks, especially in the presence of strategic adversaries. Optimal allocation strategies are becoming increasingly more complex, given that multiple heterogeneous types of resources are at a system planner's disposal. In this paper, we focus on deriving optimal strategies for the allocation of heterogeneous resources in a well-known competitive resource allocation model known as the General Lotto game. In standard formulations, outcomes are determined solely by the players' allocation strategies of a common, single type of resource across multiple contests. In particular, a player wins a contest if it sends more resources than the opponent. Here, we propose a multi-resource extension where the winner of a contest is now determined not only by the amount of resources allocated, but also by the composition of resource types that are allocated. We completely characterize the equilibrium payoffs and strategies for two distinct formulations. The first consists of a weakest-link/best-shot winning rule, and the second considers a winning rule based on a weighted linear combination of the allocated resources. We then consider a scenario where the resource types are costly to purchase, and derive the players' equilibrium investments in each of the resource types.</description>

      <title>Collective decisions under uncertainty: efficiency, ex-ante fairness, and normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies preference aggregation under uncertainty in the multi-profile framework introduced by Sprumont (2018, 2019) and characterizes a new class of aggregation rules that can address classical concerns about Harsanyi's (1955) utilitarian rules. Our class of aggregation rules, which we call relative fair aggregation rules, is grounded in three key ideas: utilitarianism, egalitarianism, and the 0--1 normalization. These rules are parameterized by a set of weights over individuals. Each ambiguous alternative is evaluated by computing the minimum weighted sum of the 0--1 normalized utility levels within that weight set. For the characterization, we propose two novel key axioms -- weak preference for mixing and restricted certainty independence -- developed using a new method of objectively randomizing outcomes even within the fully uncertain Savagean framework. Furthermore, we show that relative utilitarian aggregation rules can be identified from the above class by imposing an axiom stronger than restricted certainty independence, and that the Rawlsian maximin version can be derived by considering strong preference for mixing instead.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous All-Pay Auctions with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The all-pay auction, a classic competitive model, is widely applied in scenarios such as political elections, sports competitions, and research and development, where all participants pay their bids regardless of winning or losing. However, in the traditional all-pay auction, players have no budget constraints, whereas in real-world scenarios, players typically face budget constraints. This paper studies the Nash equilibrium of two players with budget constraints across multiple heterogeneous items in a complete-information framework. The main contributions are as follows: (1) a comprehensive characterization of the Nash equilibrium in single-item auctions with asymmetric budgets and valuations; (2) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the two-item scenario; and (3) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the three-item scenario. Unlike the unconstrained all-pay auction, which always has a Nash equilibrium, a Nash equilibrium may not exist when players have budget constraints. Our findings highlight the intricate effects of budget constraints on bidding strategies, providing new perspectives and methodologies for theoretical analysis and practical applications of all-pay auctions.</description>

      <title>Strategic formation of production networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a strategic model of the formation of production networks that subsumes the standard general equilibrium approach. The objective of firms in our setting is to choose their supply relationships so as to maximize their profit at the general equilibrium that unfolds. We show that this objective is equivalent to the maximization by the firms of their eigenvector centrality in the production network. As is common in network formation games based on centrality, there are multiple Nash equilibria in our setting. We have investigated the characteristics and the social efficiency of these equilibria in a stylized version of our model representing international trade networks. We show that the impact of network structure on social welfare is firstly determined by a trade-off between costs of increasing process complexity and positive spillovers on productivity induced by the diversification of the input mix. We further analyze a variant of our model that accounts for the risks of disruption of supply relationships. In this setting, we characterize how social welfare depends on the structure of the production network, the spatial distribution of risks, and the process of shock aggregation in supply chains. We finally show that simple trade policies characterized by sets of links that are either prevented or catalyzed can be a powerful equilibrium selection device.</description>

      <title>Information About Other Players in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of mechanism design settings where the planner has an interest in agents receiving noisy signals about the types of other agents. When the planner is interested only in partial implementation, any social choice rule that is incentive-compatible after agents receive additional information about other agents is incentive-compatible without this information. However, additional information about other agents can eliminate undesired equilibria, making it helpful to a planner interested in full implementation. We provide a sufficient condition under which a social choice rule that is not fully implementable when agents have no information about types of other agents can become fully implementable if agents have additional information.</description>

      <title>On the Oscillations in Cournot Games with Best Response Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model, which involves multiple firms producing homogeneous products. To explore the oscillation under the updates of best response strategies, we focus on the linear price functions. In this setting, we establish the existence of oscillations. In particular, we show that for the scenario of different costs among firms, the best response converges to either a unique equilibrium or a two-period oscillation. We further characterize the oscillations and propose linear-time algorithms for finding all types of two-period oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first step toward fully analyzing the periodic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model.</description>
