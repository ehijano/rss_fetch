      <title>On the Coderivative of the Projection Operator onto the Positive Cone in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized differentiability of the metric projection operator onto the positive cone in Hilbert spaces. We first establish the formula for exactly computing the regular coderivative and the Mordukhovich coderivative of the metric projection operator onto the positive cone in Euclidean spaces. Then, these results are also established for the projection operator onto the positive cone in the real Hilbert space $l_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate superdensity and the density degree of sets with respect to a Radon measure on ${\mathbf R}^n$. Some applications are provided. In particular we prove a result on the approximability of a set by closed subsets of small density degree and a generalization of Schwarz's theorem on cross derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal H$ be a Hilbert space of distributions on $\mathbf R^d$ which contains at least one non-zero element in $\mathscr D '(\mathbf R^d)$. If there is a constant $C_0&gt;0$ such that $$ \nm {e^{i\scal \cdo \xi}f(\cdo -x)}{\mathcal H}\le C_0\nm f{\mathcal H}, \qquad f\in \mathcal H ,\ x,\xi \in \mathbf R^d, $$ then we prove that $\maclH = L^2(\mathbf R^d)$, with equivalent norms.</description>

      <title>Linear matrix pencils and noncommutative convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermitian linear matrix pencils are ubiquitous in control theory, operator systems, semidefinite optimization, and real algebraic geometry. This survey reviews the fundamental features of the matricial solution set of a linear matrix inequality, the free spectrahedron, from the perspective of free real algebraic geometry. Namely, among matricial solution sets of noncommutative polynomial inequalities, free spectrahedra are precisely the convex ones. Furthermore, a procedure for detecting free spectrahedra and producing their representing linear matrix pencils is discussed. Finally, free spectrahedra admit a perfect Positivstellensatz, leading to a semidefinite programming formulation of eigenvalue optimization over convex matricial sets constrained by noncommutative polynomial inequalities.</description>

      <title>Linear algebra of quadratic forms and polynomial identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_1=\{p_1,p_2,\cdots, p_l\}\subset\cc[z_1,z_2\cdots,z_n]$ be a set of quadratic forms such that $p_i=q_i^2$ where $\{q_i\}_{i=1}^l$ are linear forms. For $1\leq k\leq l$, let $S_k=\{p_{i_1}p_{i_2}\cdots p_{i_k}|1\leq i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k\leq l\}$ be the set of $k$-products of distinct polynomials in $S_1$. We show somehow unexpectedly that linear independence of $S_1$ is equivalent to that of $S_k$ for $k=2$ and $3$ under certain rank conditions. Among technical treatments in the proof, of independent conceptual interest is a novel polynomial identity which elegantly incorporates quadratic forms and matrix determinants.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Valuations on Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all continuous valuations on the space of finite convex functions with values in the same space which are dually epi-translation-invariant and equi- resp. contravariant with respect to volume-preserving linear maps. We thereby identify the valuation-theoretic functional analogues of the difference body map and show that there does not exist a generalization of the projection body map in this setting. This non-existence result is shown to also hold true for valuations with values in the space of convex functions that are finite in a neighborhood of the origin.</description>

      <title>A geometrical approach to the sharp Hardy inequality in Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a partial negative answer to a question left open in a previous work by Brasco and the first and third-named authors concerning the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality on convex sets. Our approach has a geometrical flavor and equivalently reformulates the sharp constant in the limit case $p=1$ as the Cheeger constant for the fractional perimeter and the Lebesgue measure with a suitable weight. As a by-product, we obtain new lower bounds on the sharp constant in the $1$-dimensional case, even for non-convex sets, some of which optimal in the case $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of some non-commuting double ergodic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ and $T$ be measure-preserving transformations of a probability space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$. Let $f$ be a bounded measurable functions, and consider the integrals of the corresponding `double' ergodic averages: \[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int f(S^ix)f(T^ix)\ d\mu(x) \qquad (n\ge 1).\] We provide a new construction of diverse examples for which these integrals do not converge as $n\to\infty$. These include examples in which $S$ and $T$ are rigid, and hence have entropy zero, answering a question of Frantzikinakis and Host. We begin with a corresponding construction of pairs of unitary operators on a complex Hilbert space, and then construct transformations of a Gaussian measure space from them.</description>

      <title>The logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the logarithmic analogue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces. This operator is intrinsically defined with spectral properties analogous to those of elliptic pseudo-differential operators on Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, its heat semigroup consists of compact operators which are trace-class after some critical point in time. Moreover, its domain is a Banach module over the Dini continuous functions and every H\"older continuous function is a smooth vector. Finally, the operator is compatible, in the sense of noncommutative geometry, with the action of a large class of non-isometric homeomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hille's theorem is a powerful classical result in vector measure theory. It asserts that the application of a closed, unbounded linear operator commutes with strong/Bochner integration of functions taking values in a Banach space. This note shows that Hille's theorem also holds in the setting of complete locally convex spaces.</description>

      <title>Coordinate systems in Banach spaces and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using methods of descriptive set theory, in particular, the determinacy of infinite games of perfect information, we answer several questions from the literature regarding different notions of bases in Banach spaces and lattices. For the case of Banach lattices, our results follow from a general theorem stating that (under the assumption of analytic determinacy), every $\sigma$-order basis $(e_n)$ for a Banach lattice $X=[e_n]$ is a uniform basis, and every uniform basis is Schauder. Moreover, the notions of order and $\sigma$-order bases coincide when $X=[e_n].$ Regarding Banach spaces, we address two problems concerning filter Schauder bases for Banach spaces, i.e., in which the norm convergence of partial sums is replaced by norm convergence along some appropriate filter on $\mathbb N$. We first provide an example of a Banach space admitting such a filter Schauder basis, but no ordinary Schauder basis. Secondly, we show that every filter Schauder basis with respect to an analytic filter is also a filter Schauder basis with respect to a Borel filter.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundaries of Representations and Coideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$, a (left) coideal is a (left) $\mathbb{G}$-invariant von Neumann subalgebra of $L^\infty(\mathbb{G})$. We introduce and analyze various generalizations of amenability and coamenability to coideals of discrete and compact quantum groups. We focus on a particular class of coideals found in the category of compact quantum groups, which are associated with a compact quasi-subgroup. This class includes all coideals of the quotient type. We also introduce the notion of a Furstenberg-Hamana boundary for representations of discrete quantum groups and use it to study amenability and coamenability properties of coideals. We then prove that a coideal of a compact quantum group that is associated with a compact quasi-subgroup is coamenable if and only if its codual coideal is $\mathbb{G}$-injective. If $\mathbb{G}$ is a unimodular or an exact discrete quantum group, we can replace $\mathbb{G}$-injectivity in the latter statement with the weaker condition of relative amenability. This result leads to a complete characterization of the unique trace property. Specifically, a unimodular discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ has the unique trace property if and only if the action of $\mathbb{G}$ on its noncommutative Furstenberg boundary is faithful. We also demonstrated that if a unimodular discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ is $C^*$-simple then it has the unique trace property. These findings are the quantum analogs of the groundbreaking results of Breuillard, Kalantar, Kennedy, and Ozawa and they provide answers to questions posted by Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of an Extremal Function for the Delsarte Extremal Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the general setting of a locally compact Abelian group $G$, the Delsarte extremal problem asks for the supremum of integrals over the collection of continuous positive definite functions $f: G \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(0) = 1$ and having $\mathrm{supp} f_{+} \subset \Omega$ for some measurable subset $\Omega$ of finite measure. In this paper, we consider the question of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In particular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte problem when $\Omega$ is closed, extending previously known existence results to a larger class of functions.</description>
