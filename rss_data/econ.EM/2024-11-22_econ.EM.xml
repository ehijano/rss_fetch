      <title>Dynamic spatial interaction models for a leader's resource allocation and followers' multiple activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spatial interaction model to explore the decision-making processes of two types of agents-a leader and followers-with central and local governments serving as empirical representations. The model accounts for three key features: (i) resource allocations from the leader to the followers and the resulting strategic interactions, (ii) followers' choices across multiple activities, and (iii) interactions among these activities. We develop a network game to examine the micro-foundations of these processes. In this game, followers engage in multiple activities, while the leader allocates resources by monitoring the externalities arising from followers' interactions. The game's unique NE is the foundation for our econometric framework, providing equilibrium measures to understand the short-term impacts of changes in followers' characteristics and their long-term consequences. To estimate the agent payoff parameters, we employ the QML estimation method and examine the asymptotic properties of the QML estimator to ensure robust statistical inferences. Empirically, we investigate interactions among U.S. states in public welfare expenditures (PWE) and housing and community development expenditures (HCDE), focusing on how federal grants influence these expenditures and the interactions among state governments. Our findings reveal positive spillovers in states' PWEs, complementarity between the two expenditures within states, and negative cross-variable spillovers between them. Additionally, we observe positive effects of federal grants on both expenditures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that federal interventions lead to a 6.46% increase in social welfare by increasing the states' efforts on PWE and HCDE. However, due to the limited flexibility in federal grants, their magnitudes are smaller than the proportion of federal grants within the states' total revenues.</description>

      <title>Does regional variation in wage levels identify the effects of a national minimum wage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the validity of estimators that exploit regional differences in wage levels to identify the labor market effects of a national minimum wage. Specifically, it examines variations of the ``fraction affected'' and ``effective minimum wage'' designs. The study finds that these estimators are prone to biases from correlated measurement errors and functional form misspecification, even when identification assumptions from previous literature are met. Additionally, minor deviations from these assumptions can introduce significant biases. Through a series of simulation exercises and a detailed case study of Brazil's federal minimum wage increase starting in 1995, the paper documents the practical relevance of these biases and evaluates the effectiveness of potential solutions and diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Demystifying and avoiding the OLS "weighting problem": Unmodeled heterogeneity and straightforward solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have long run regressions of an outcome variable (Y) on a treatment (D) and covariates (X) to estimate treatment effects. Even absent unobserved confounding, the regression coefficient on D in this setup reports a conditional variance weighted average of strata-wise average effects, not generally equal to the average treatment effect (ATE). Numerous proposals have been offered to cope with this "weighting problem", including interpretational tools to help characterize the weights and diagnostic aids to help researchers assess the potential severity of this problem. We make two contributions that together suggest an alternative direction for researchers and this literature. Our first contribution is conceptual, demystifying these weights. Simply put, under heterogeneous treatment effects (and varying probability of treatment), the linear regression of Y on D and X will be misspecified. The "weights" of regression offer one characterization for the coefficient from regression that helps to clarify how it will depart from the ATE. We also derive a more general expression for the weights than what is usually referenced. Our second contribution is practical: as these weights simply characterize misspecification bias, we suggest simply avoiding them through an approach that tolerate heterogeneous effects. A wide range of longstanding alternatives (regression-imputation/g-computation, interacted regression, and balancing weights) relax specification assumptions to allow heterogeneous effects. We make explicit the assumption of "separate linearity", under which each potential outcome is separately linear in X. This relaxation of conventional linearity offers a common justification for all of these methods and avoids the weighting problem, at an efficiency cost that will be small when there are few covariates relative to sample size.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Guided Active Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new framework for active experimentation, the Prediction-Guided Active Experiment (PGAE), which leverages predictions from an existing machine learning model to guide sampling and experimentation. Specifically, at each time step, an experimental unit is sampled according to a designated sampling distribution, and the actual outcome is observed based on an experimental probability. Otherwise, only a prediction for the outcome is available. We begin by analyzing the non-adaptive case, where full information on the joint distribution of the predictor and the actual outcome is assumed. For this scenario, we derive an optimal experimentation strategy by minimizing the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the class of regular estimators. We then introduce an estimator that meets this efficiency bound, achieving asymptotic optimality. Next, we move to the adaptive case, where the predictor is continuously updated with newly sampled data. We show that the adaptive version of the estimator remains efficient and attains the same semi-parametric bound under certain regularity assumptions. Finally, we validate PGAE's performance through simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment using data from the US Census Bureau. The results underscore the PGAE framework's effectiveness and superiority compared to other existing methods.</description>
