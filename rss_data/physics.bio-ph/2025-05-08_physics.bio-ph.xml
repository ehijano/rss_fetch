      <title>A micro-to-macroscale and multi-method investigation of human sweating dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sweat secretion and evaporation from the skin dictate the human ability to thermoregulate and thermal comfort in hot environments and impact skin interactions with cosmetics, textiles, and wearable electronics or sensors. However, sweating has mostly been investigated using macroscopic physiological methods, leaving micro-to-macroscale sweating dynamics unexplored. We explore these processes by employing a coupled microscale imaging and transport measurement approach used in engineering studies of phase change processes. Specifically, we employed a comprehensive set of macroscale physiological measurements (ventilated capsule sweat rate, galvanic skin conductance, and dielectric epidermis hydration) complemented by three microscale imaging techniques (visible light, midwave infrared, and optical coherence tomography imaging). Inspired by industrial jet cooling devices, we also explore an air jet (vs. cylindrical) capsule for measuring sweat rate. To enable near simultaneous application of these methods, we studied forehead sweating dynamics of six supine subjects undergoing passive heating, cooling, and secondary heating. The relative dynamics of the physiological measurements agree with prior observations and can be explained using imaged microscale sweating dynamics. This comprehensive study provides new insights into the biophysical dynamics of sweating onset and following cyclic porewise, transition, and filmwise sweating modes, and highlights the roles of stratum corneum hydration, salt deposits, and microscale hair.</description>

      <title>Clot Treatment via Compression- and Shear-Induced Densification of Fibrin Network Microstructure: A Combined in Vitro and In Silico Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood clots, consisting of red blood cells (RBCs) entrapped within a fibrin network, can cause life-threatening conditions such as stroke and heart attack. The recently developed milli-spinner thrombectomy device presents a promising mechanical approach to removing clots by substantially modifying the microstructure of the blood clot, resulting in up to 95% volume reduction through combined compressive and shear forces. To better understand the mechanism and optimize this approach, it is important to quantitatively understand of how compression and shear loadings alter the clot structure. In this study, we combine in vitro experiments with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations to investigate the effectiveness of clot debulking under integrated compression and shear. Controlled experiments quantify clot volume changes, while simulations offer microscopic insight into fibrin network densification and RBC release. This integrated approach enables a systematic evaluation of mechanical response and microstructure change of different clot types, providing fundamental knowledge to guide the rational design of next-generation mechanical thrombectomy technologies.</description>

      <title>SmartTrap: Automated Precision Experiments with Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a trend in research towards more automation using smart systems powered by artificial
  intelligence. While experiments are often challenging to automate, they can greatly benefit from
  automation by reducing labor and increasing reproducibility. For example, optical tweezers are
  widely employed in single-molecule biophysics, cell biomechanics, and soft matter physics, but they
  still require a human operator, resulting in low throughput and limited repeatability. Here, we
  present a smart optical tweezers platform, which we name SmartTrap, capable of performing complex
  experiments completely autonomously. SmartTrap integrates real-time 3D particle tracking using
  deep learning, custom electronics for precise feedback control, and a microfluidic setup for particle
  handling. We demonstrate the ability of SmartTrap to operate continuously, acquiring high-precision
  data over extended periods of time, through a series of experiments. By bridging the gap between
  manual experimentation and autonomous operation, SmartTrap establishes a robust and open source
  framework for the next generation of optical tweezers research, capable of performing large-scale
  studies in single-molecule biophysics, cell mechanics, and colloidal science with reduced experimental
  overhead and operator bias.</description>

      <title>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</description>

      <title>Statistical method for A-RNA and B-DNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids have been regarded as stiff polymers with long-range flexibility and generally modeled using elastic rod models of polymer physics. Notwithstanding, investigations carried out over the past few years on single fragments of order $\sim 100$ base pairs have revealed remarkable flexibility properties at short scales and called for theoretical approaches that emphasize the role of the bending fluctuations at single sites along the molecule stack. Here, we review a three dimensional mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which assumes a discrete representation of the double stranded (ds) molecules at the level of the nucleotides. The model captures the fundamental local interactions between adjacent sugar-phosphate groups and the pairwise interactions between complementary base pair mates. A statistical method based on the path integral formalism sets the ensemble of the base pair breathing fluctuations which are included in the partition function and permits to derive the thermodynamics and the elastic response of single molecules to external forces. We apply the model to the computation of the twist-stretch relations for fragments of ds-DNA and ds-RNA, showing that the obtained opposite pattern (DNA overtwists whereas RNA untwists versus force) follows from the different structural features of the two helices. Moreover, we focus on the DNA stretching due to the confinement in nano-pores and, finally, on the computation of the cyclization probability of open ends molecules of $\sim 100$ base pairs under physiological conditions. The mesoscopic model shows a distinct advantage over the elastic rod model in estimating the molecule bendability at short length scale.</description>

      <title>Structure determination from single-molecule X-ray scattering images using stochastic gradient ascent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments using ultrashort X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses have opened a new path for structure determination of a wide variety of specimens, including nano-crystals and entire viruses, approaching atomistic spatial and femtoseconds time resolution. However, random and unknown sample orientations as well as low signal to noise ratios have so far prevented a successful application to smaller specimens like single biomolecules. We here present resolution-annealed stochastic gradient ascent (RASTA), a new approach for direct atomistic electron density determination, which utilizes our recently developed rigorous Bayesian treatment of single-particle X-ray scattering. We demonstrate electron density determination at 2\r{A} resolution of various small proteins from synthetic scattering images with as low as 15 photons per image.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Law of Polymer Chains into Flexible Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium partitioning of linear polymer chains into flexible polymer networks is governed by intricate entropic constraints arising from configurational degrees of freedom of both chains and network, yet a quantitative understanding remains elusive. Using model hydrogels with precisely defined network structures, we experimentally reveal a universal law governing linear polymer partitioning into flexible polymer networks. We establish a novel label-free, contactless method to measure partition ratio, based on the increase in osmotic pressure induced by external polymer chains partitioning into the network. Moreover, we find a universal law in which the partition constant is solely determined by the squared ratio $(R_g / l_\mathrm{cycle})^2$, where $R_g$ is the gyration radius of the polymer chain and $l_\mathrm{cycle}$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network, as defined by the cycle length.</description>

      <title>Emergent Complexity in a Light-Driven Self-Oscillatory Crystal: A Molecular Perspective on Autonomous Behavior and Stimulus-Modulated Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living organisms are molecular systems with self-sustained dynamics via energy conversion through molecular cooperation, resulting in highly complex macroscopic behaviors. Construction of such autonomous macroscopic dynamics at a molecular system level remains one of the central challenges in the field of chemistry. Looking further ahead, constructing motile systems that can receive external information and adapt their autonomous behavior represents the next frontier towards newly functional molecular devices such as microrobots. In this study, we focused on a light-driven self-oscillatory crystal that exhibits continuous flipping motion under constant light irradiation. We experimentally evaluated the oscillation frequency of the crystal under polarized light and confirmed the validity of our previously proposed mechanism, and clarified the requirements for self-oscillation. Based on this mechanism, we constructed a mathematical model that demonstrates the motion of the crystal itself. The model revealed that diverse oscillatory behaviors at the macroscopic level can emerge due to small differences in conditions even when the underlying molecular-level processes are identical. Furthermore, we found that the oscillatory behavior depended on the state generated by the previously applied light. This suggests that a memory effect contributes to the complex motion of the crystal.</description>
