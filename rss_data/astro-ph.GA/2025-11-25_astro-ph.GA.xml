      <title>The odd primordial halo of the Milky Way implied by Gaia. A shallow core, but a steep decline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial dark matter halos are well understood from cold dark matter-only simulations. Since they can contract significantly as baryons settle into their centers, direct comparisons with observed galaxies are complicated. We present an approach to reversing the halo contraction by numerically calculating the halo response to baryonic infall and iterating the initial condition. This allowed us to derive spherically averaged primordial dark matter halos for observed galaxies. We applied this approach to the Milky Way and found that the latest Gaia measurements for the rotation velocities imply an odd primordial Galactic halo: Its concentration and total mass differ by more than 3$\sigma$ from the predictions, and the density profile presents an inner core that is too shallow and an outer decline that is too steep to be compatible with the cold dark matter paradigm.</description>

      <title>PROJECT-J: the shocking H2 outflow from HH46</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow. We used NIRSpec and MIRI spectral maps (1.6-27.9 microns) to trace the structure and physical conditions of the outflow. By fitting the H2 rotational diagrams with a multi-temperature gas model, we derived key physical parameters including temperature, extinction, column densities, and the ortho-to-para ratio. This information is combined with a detailed kinematical analysis and comparison with irradiated shock models.
  We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary.
  The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.</description>

      <title>JADES: Low Surface Brightness Galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 in GOODS-S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are an important class of galaxies that allow us to broaden our understanding of galaxy formation and test various cosmological models. We present a survey of low surface brightness galaxies at $0.4 &lt; z_{\rm phot} &lt; 0.8$ in the GOODS-S field using JADES data. We model LSB surface brightness profiles, identifying those with $\bar{\mu}_{\rm eff} &gt; 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the F200W JWST/NIRCam filter. We study the spatial distribution, number density, S\'{e}rsic profile parameters, and rest-frame colours of these LSBs. We compare the photometrically-derived star formation histories, mass-weighted ages, and dust attenuations of these galaxies with a high surface brightness (HSB) sample at similar redshift and a lower redshift ($z_{\rm phot} &lt; 0.4$) LSB sample, all of which have stellar masses $\lesssim 10^8 M_{\odot}$. We find that both the high and the low redshift LSB samples have low star formation (SFR$_{100} \lesssim 0.01$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared with the HSB sample (SFR$_{100} \gtrsim 0.01$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The star formation histories show that the LSBs and HSBs possibly come from the same progenitors at $z \gtrsim 2$, though the histories are not well constrained for the LSB samples. The LSBs appear to have minimal dust, with most of our LSB samples showing $A_V &lt; 1$ mag. JWST has pushed our understanding of LSBs beyond the local Universe.</description>

      <title>An Overabundance of Radio-AGN in the SPT2349-56 Protocluster: Preheating the Intra-Cluster Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the detection of a radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56, we have obtained additional observations with MeerKAT in S-band (2.4 GHz) with the aim of further characterizing radio emission from amongst the ~30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We newly identify three of the protocluster SMGs individually at 2.4GHz as having a radio-excess, two of which are now known to be X-ray luminous AGN. Two additional members are also detected with radio emission consistent with their star formation rate (SFR). Archival MeerKAT UHF (816 MHz) observations further constrain luminosities and radio spectral indices of these five galaxies. The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is used to detect and resolve the central two sources at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz finding elongated, jet-like morphologies. The excess radio luminosities range from L1.4,rest = (1-20)x10^25 W/Hz, ~10-100x higher than expected from the SFRs, assuming the usual far-infrared-radio correlation. Of the known cluster members, only the SMG `N1' shows signs of AGN in any other diagnostics, namely a large and compact excess in CO(11-10) line emission. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs. The overdensity of radio-loud AGN in the compact core region of the cluster may be providing significant heating to the recently discovered nascent intra-cluster medium (ICM) in SPT2349-56.</description>

      <title>ACES: The Magnetic Field in Large Filaments in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center (GC) is an extreme region of the Milky Way that is host to a complex set of thermal and non-thermal structures. In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary "bones" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Tracing Quenching in Nearby Galaxies Through Inner Surface Mass Density and Cold Gas Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc, Sigma1, has emerged as a suitable proxy for bulge growth and galaxy quenching. However, the dependence of cold gas content on Sigma1 has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we examine the relationship between Sigma1, as well as the mass-relative parameter delSigma1, and the atomic (fHI) and molecular (fH2) cold gas fractions in massive, nearby galaxies. We utilize a sample of 341 galaxies with HI data and 201 galaxies with H2 data from the xGASS and xCOLDGASS surveys, spanning 0.02 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.05 and a stellar mass range of 10^10 &lt;= M_*/M_odot &lt;= 10^11.5. While we observe that a decline in both fHI and fH2 is associated with increasing Sigma1, we find that fH2 shows a sharper decline above a threshold value of delSigma1 = 0. In addition, the fraction of galaxies with AGN activity (Seyferts and LINERs) increases with delSigma1, with the greatest increase occurring between 0 &lt;= delSigma1 &lt;= 0.2 dex. We propose an evolutionary track in the plane of fH2-delSigma1, whereby molecular gas depletion at fixed mass coincides with a rise in AGN activity. Our results suggest that central bulge growth is more tightly coupled to the depletion of molecular gas rather than atomic gas, with AGN feedback possibly contributing to this process. Our work highlights the utility of Sigma1 and delSigma1 as tracers of quenching in massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Deep X-ray observation of NGC 3221: everything everywhere all at once</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 475 ks (438 ks unpublished &amp; 37 ks archival) XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn observation of a nearby, highly inclined, star-forming, luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3221 through spatial, temporal, and spectral information. We confirm the presence of a low-luminosity (presumably Compton-thick) AGN. The 0.4$-$12 keV luminosity and the hardness ratio of the six ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) previously identified in Chandra data exhibit diverse variability on day-scale. The collective emission from unresolved sources exhibits a different day-scale variability. We have also discovered two new predominantly soft ($&lt;1$ keV) sources. One of these has an enigmatic spectral shape featuring a soft component, which we interpret as a superbubble in NGC 3221, and a variable hard component from a compact object, which is unresolved from the superbubble. We do not confidently detect any X-ray emission from SN 1961L. The hot gas in the ISM (out to $\pm$6 kpc from the disk plane) and the extraplanar region (6$-$12 kpc) both require two thermal phases at $\sim 0.15$ keV and $\sim 0.55$ keV. The $\sim 0.55$ keV component is fainter in the ISM than the $\sim 0.15$ keV component, but the emission from the latter falls off more steeply with disk height than the former. This makes the extraplanar region hotter and less dense than the ISM. The proximity of NGC 3221 and the occurrence of the underluminous AGN offer a unique observing opportunity to study the hot diffuse medium in conjunction with nuclear and disk-wide point sources.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Galactic Atomic Hydrogen Position-Position-Velocity Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 3D Galactic HI filaments over 1/3 of the sky using Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) data. The 3D filaments are defined to be linear HI features that are continuous in position-position-velocity (PPV) and are found with fil3d, an algorithm that expands on the 2D FilFinder. The catalog contains 3333 HI filaments between +/- 50 km/s at a range of Galactic positions. 1542 of the PPV filaments are identified as local at the distance of the wall of the Local Bubble, and 209 are likely at the disk-halo interface of our Galaxy. The catalog and properties of the PPV filaments are obtained after an unsharp mask (USM) is applied to the data. The widths of the filaments are consistently ~12' (0.34 pc at 100 pc), and constrained by the 4' resolution. The local filaments have median properties of N_HI = $6 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, M_HI = 0.17 M_sun, FWHM = 3.2 km/s, and length of 6.4 pc. The disk-halo population has similar column densities, but the median FWHM = 7.7 km/s, consistent with them being higher z-height, warmer structures. The L $\propto$ M$^{0.5}$ relationship found for the HI filaments and their bundling on the sky are consistent with a hierarchical structure, and is likely related to turbulence playing a role in their formation.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. Bracketing the critical curve with sparse lensed image pairs of compact continuum sources may not be sufficient as additional information available throughout the extended arc is not used. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of nebular emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" ($1\sigma$). This reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\alpha$ line at SNR $\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty may improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve where it crosses the giant arc, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs in extragalactic lensing fields and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.</description>

      <title>Revealing the magnetization of the intracluster medium of Abell 3581 using background Faraday rotation measures from the POSSUM survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The line-of-sight magnetic field of galaxy clusters can be probed using Faraday rotation measure (RM) data. However, our understanding of cluster magnetism is limited due to the scarcity of polarized background radio sources, with most previous studies being constrained to $\sim 10$ sources per cluster. Leveraging the increased source density of the POlarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), we probe the magnetic field properties of the galaxy cluster Abell 3581 {(A3581)} with 111 RMs. We find that the standard deviation in the RM declines monotonically with increasing radius up to 0.75 Mpc{, agreeing with a radially declining magnetic field and electron density profile modeled as Gaussian and lognormal random fields, respectively. {We compare our observations of the inner 0.75 Mpc of A3581 to various semi-analytic models of the magnetic field and electron density, and obtain several best-fit models.} For the first time, we compare the observed RMs in a cluster to full magnetohydrodynamic simulated clusters from TNG-Cluster and find that the non-monotonic trend in RM standard deviation past 0.75 Mpc in A3581 is likely caused by past or present merger activity. We identify a possible candidate for a merger to be the galaxy group [DZ2015b] 276, which would be the first group detected in RMs that is not strongly emitting in X-rays. We find a possible merger axis of A3581 with this group at a position angle of $\theta = 52\pm 4$ deg.</description>

      <title>From Simulations to Surveys: Domain Adaptation for Galaxy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large photometric surveys will image billions of galaxies, but we currently lack quick, reliable automated ways to infer their physical properties like morphology, stellar mass, and star formation rates. Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based "top_$k$ soft matching" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\sim$46% ($\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\sim$87% ($\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.</description>

      <title>The Plane Quasar Survey: An Ionized Extension of the Magellanic Stream on the Northern Side of the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Stream (MS) is a vast gaseous structure in the Milky Way halo, containing most of its mass in ionized form and tracing the interaction between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. Using HST/COS G160M spectra from the Plane Quasar Survey, we detect C IV absorbers likely associated with the MS, extending to the northern side of the Galactic plane, approximately 60$^\circ$ beyond its previously known ionized extent. These absorbers exhibit position and kinematic alignment and show consistent ionization trends with previously studied MS sight lines. The non-detection of low ions such as Al II and Si II, and the detection of C IV (and Si IV in some sightlines), indicates a highly ionized gas phase. The observed Si IV/C IV column density ratios suggest a gas temperature of $T \sim 10^{5.3}$~K and favor collisional ionization over photoionization. We estimate the newly detected extension increases the previous ionized gas mass of the MS, and its coherent kinematics suggest that it was stripped within the past few hundred Myr and has not yet mixed with the Milky Way halo. The existence of highly-ionized MS gas at a location above the Galactic Plane may constrain the orbital direction of the Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>Milky Way galaxy-analogs and isolated galaxies with bars: environmental density in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| &lt;= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 &lt; 0.02) and high (z0 &gt;= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma &lt; 0.05), filament (0.05 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 0.5), group (0.5 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 2.0), and cluster (Sigma &gt;= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z &lt; 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D &lt; 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z &gt; 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.</description>

      <title>The dawn is quiet II: Gaia XP constraints on the Milky Way's proto-Galaxy from very metal-poor MDF tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earliest phase of the Milky Way's evolution involved a transition from a dispersion-supported proto-galaxy to a rotationally supported disk. A key chemical signature of this transition is the moderate rise in [$\alpha$/Fe] near $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\approx-1.3$, which we previously interpreted as evidence for $\alpha$-enhanced gas accretion fueling early disk formation. However, this trend alone does not uniquely constrain the trade-off between initial gas mass, inflow rate, and star formation efficiency (SFE), leaving the physical condition of the proto-Milky Way uncertain. To break this degeneracy, we analyze the metal-poor tail ($-3&lt;\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&lt;-2$) of the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function (MDF) using Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) metallicities from ten catalogs. After applying recommended quality cuts, all catalogs exhibit a single-slope exponential tail with slopes $k\simeq0.5$--2.0. Comparison with one-zone galactic chemical-evolution (GCE) models that replicated the [$\alpha$/Fe]-rise from Paper I shows that shallow tails ($k\simeq0.6$) require a massive initial cold gas reservoir ($\gtrsim10^9\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$), while steeper tails ($k\gtrsim1$) arise from small reservoirs that built up over time with weak inflow. MDFs with $k \simeq 1.0$ are best reproduced under our GCE framework, which favor a proto-Galaxy with a moderate gas reservoir ($10^{8}$--$10^{9}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) sustained through weak continuous inflow ($\sim 2 \ \mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$) and SFE comparable to today's value (a few $\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) during the first Gyr. This scenario is reinforced by MDFs of 30 Milky Way analogs in the Auriga simulations, which exhibit similar slopes ($k\approx1.2$). The metal-poor MDF tail thus provides a quantitative constraint on the Milky Way's early gas accretion and star formation history.</description>

      <title>Inclinations and Position Angles for Disc Galaxies in the SGA sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for determining the inclination and position angle (PA) of disc galaxies using a Fourier-Laguerre basis decomposition of imaging data. We define a dimensionless metric, $\eta$, that characterises the ratio of the quadrupole and monopole coefficients in the Fourier-Laguerre basis function expansion. This metric serves as a robust measure which is related to the inclination of a galaxy. We find an empirical relationship between $\eta$ and inclination which is agnostic to the galaxy morphology. The PA is derived directly from the phase of the quadrupolar Fourier-Laguerre functions. Across a benchmark sample of galaxies, the method reproduces published inclination and PA values to within a median of 10$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$, respectively, while also demonstrating essentially zero catastrophic failures. Applying this pipeline to galaxies from the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA), we report measurements of $\eta$, scale length and PA for three different bands of 133,942 disc galaxies. Our computationally inexpensive technique automates parametrisation analysis and returns reproducible results for large surveys. We release a Python package ready for application to next generation surveys.</description>

      <title>The Optical Evolution of the Tycho Supernova Remnant over Three Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a series of images of the Tycho supernova remnant at eight epochs extending over thirty years: 1986-2016. In addition to our H{\alpha} images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho.</description>

      <title>Outflow Interaction in Cep-E: Numerical Simulation and Observational Manifestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is clear observational evidence that the main Class 0/I stages of the star formation process are associated with powerful collimated outflows (jets), which sometimes propagate up to distances as large as $10^{4-5}$ au scales in molecular clouds. Additionally, intermediate high-mass and low-mass protostars have often been observed to form in crowded clusters, where the typical separation distance between any two cluster members is of the same order or smaller than the scale of the outflow length. Therefore, there must be an interaction between the molecular outflows of different protostars within the protostellar association. A good example of this is the case of Cepheus E-mm, which is a protostellar outflow extending over a few dozen au. At its core is a binary system consisting of two protostars, Cep E-A and Cep E-B, separated by about 1000 au. Both protostars eject molecular jets at velocities of ~100 km/s. The interaction between these molecular outflows provides an opportunity to study the effects of jet collisions in a clustered star-forming environment, as they may leave detectable imprints on the morphology of the main envelope of the system. Our work aims to study the effects of the collision of molecular jets associated with the components of the binary system Cep-A and Cep-E, analyzing the disruption or reduction of molecular emission in the main envelope of the system, which the molecular outflow { launched} by Cep-A presumably pushes. If we characterize the collision in this system, we can provide insights into the expected morphology and molecular emissions in collisions of molecular outflows { associated to star forming process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We announce a recently detected outburst that is currently only a few months old, and probably of FU Orionis type. The progenitor to the outburst was an emission-line, flat-spectrum SED young stellar object located in the W5 region, though somewhat outside the main star formation action. We present optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared lightcurves that illustrate the quiescent state of [KAG2008] 13656 and its subsequent$\Delta r \approx -4$ mag and $\Delta J\approx -3$ mag outburst over $\sim$75 days in late-2025. Follow-up optical and near-infrared spectroscopy confirms the expected features from an FU Ori disk and outflow.</description>

      <title>Constraining linear form of $f(\mathcal{R,G,T})$ gravity from astrophysical observations of the Pulsar U1724</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine the internal structure of compact stars within an extended gravitational framework described by the function $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})$. Throughout this work, the quantity $\mathcal{R}$ refers to the curvature scalar formed from the Ricci tensor. The term $\mathcal{G}$ denotes the Gauss--Bonnet curvature invariant, while $\mathcal{T}$ corresponds to the trace obtained by contracting the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis is directed toward massive radio pulsars with masses above $1.8\,M_{\odot}$, which provide an exceptional testing ground for gravity under conditions inaccessible to laboratory experiments. Adopting the linear form $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha\,\mathcal{G}+\beta\,\mathcal{T}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters of suitable dimensionality,\footnote{$\alpha$ has dimensions of $[L^{2}]$ and $\beta$ carries units of $[N^{-1}]$.} we obtain an exact analytic solution for static anisotropic stellar matter in hydrostatic equilibrium. This solution allows all physical quantities to be expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameters $ \alpha_{1}=\alpha/R^{2},\qquad \beta_{1}=\beta/\kappa^{2}$ together with the compactness $C=2GM/(Rc^{2})$. We constraint the two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by matching the model with the mass and radius of pulsar \textit{U1724} requires restricting these parameters to $\alpha_{1}=\pm0.023$ and $\beta_{1}=\pm0.001$, where $\kappa^{2}=8\pi G/c^{4}$ is the standard Einstein coupling. The resulting stellar configuration satisfies the causal bound on the radial sound speed, $c_{s}^{2}&lt;c^{2}/3$, distinguishing it from the corresponding behaviour in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spin Estimation with Time-variable Image of M87 During the Flaring State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\rm g}$ with $t_{\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\rm g}$.</description>

      <title>Insights into jet-NLR energetics in PMN J0948+0022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of the optical spectra of PMN J0948+0022 showed significant variations in the spectral lines that, when combined with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray light curve and radio observations reported by other authors, were interpreted as the result of interactions between the relativistic jet and the narrow-line region (NLR). In this work, we present order-of-magnitude calculations of the energetics associated with this proposed jet-NLR interaction. We demonstrate that the observed outflows are capable of absorbing a fraction of the jet energy and converting it into kinetic energy. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the optical spectral variability recorded with the X-shooter and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instruments. Our results support the scenario in which feedback from the relativistic jet can dynamically influence the circumnuclear gas, offering new insights into the coupling between jets and the NLR in $\gamma$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts from White Dwarf Binary Mergers: Isolated and Triple-Induced Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \approx 2\times10^4~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability.</description>

      <title>Spectrophotometric evidence for a metal-bearing, carbonaceous, and pristine interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19112</link>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is only the second confirmed cometary object known to enter the Solar System from interstellar space. Cosmogonic considerations suggest that this body may possess relatively high tensile strength and a substantial metal fraction. We present photometric observations along its inbound trajectory toward perihelion, together with a spectroscopic comparison to pristine carbonaceous chondrites from the NASA Antarctic collection. The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets.</description>

      <title>The Non-universal Pseudo Phase-Space Density Profiles of Symphony Host Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations have long suggested that the pseudo phase-space density (PPSD), $\rho/\sigma^3$, of cold dark matter halos follows the universal relation $\rho/\sigma^3 \propto r^{\chi}$, with $\chi \approx -1.875$, as predicted by spherical secondary-infall similarity solutions. This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $\rho(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $\sigma(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M_\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone.</description>

      <title>Diverse reddening distributions in sight lines to type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening. The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\times 10^{-2}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.</description>

      <title>The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star formation and temperate mass-loaded outflows in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>JADES and BlackTHUNDER: rest-frame Balmer-line absorption and the local environment in a Little Red Dot at z = 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a broad-line AGN at z=5.077, observed with both NIRSpec/MSA and NIRSpec/IFU by the JADES and BlackTHUNDER surveys. The target exhibits all the hallmark features of a 'Little Red Dot' (LRD) AGN. The combination of spatially resolved and high-resolution spectroscopy offers deeper insight into its nature. The H$\alpha$ line has multiple components, including two broad Gaussians, yielding a black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=7.65$, while the narrow [O III]$\lambda$5007 gives a galaxy dynamical mass of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot)=9.1$ suggesting a dynamically overmassive black hole relative to the host galaxy. The target is immersed in a 7-kpc wide pool of ionized gas and has three neighbours: a satellite galaxy, a possible satellite/gas cloud and a tentatively detected spatially detached outflow. H$\alpha$ shows strong absorption, deeper than the continuum, thus ruling out a stellar origin, and with velocity and velocity dispersion of v=-13 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma$=120 km s$^{-1}$. There is tentative evidence (2.6 $\sigma$) of temporal variability in the EW of the H$\alpha$ absorber over two rest-frame months. If confirmed, this would suggest a highly dynamic environment. Notably, while the H$\alpha$ absorber is clearly visible and even dominant in the high-resolution G395H observations, it is not detected in the medium-resolution G395M data of the same epoch. This implies that the current incidence rate of absorbers in LRDs - and especially of rest-frame absorbers - may be severely underestimated, because most LRDs rely on lower-resolution spectroscopy. In this context, the high incidence rate of rest-frame absorbers in LRDs may indicate a configuration that is either intrinsically stationary, such as a rotating disc, or that exhibits time-averaged stability, such as an oscillatory 'breathing mode' accretion of cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas around the SMBH.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational, statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, using two samples of 2,170 and 1,329 systems with $M &gt; 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, selected from two publicly available group catalogs (\citet{2017A&amp;A...602A.100T} and \citet{2012ApJ...752...41Y}) constructed with two different algorithms and but both based primarily on SDSS galaxies. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find compelling statistical evidence for coherent rotation, as the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution departs markedly from the randomized controls, exhibiting pronounced deviations near $380\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim360~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim693~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Stellar Feedback Effects on the Mass Distribution of Clouds and Cloud Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback, particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff densities of $10,\ 10^{1.5},\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe, stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for clouds with $n&gt;100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution for complexes with $n&gt;10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence, suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and, in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature.

      <title>HST Confirms Sub-5 kpc Dual Quasar Pairs at Cosmic Noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During cosmic noon ($z\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained challenging due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z&gt;1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\pm0.1)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Head-tail molecular clouds falling onto the Milky Way disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at $l=331.6^{\circ}$ and $b=0^{\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO $J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \pm 0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses of $4.8\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$ and $3.5\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$, respectively, and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar medium are discussed.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Hunting for luminous z &gt; 6 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Fields -- forecasts and first bright detections</title>

Abstract: The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z &gt; 6, its bright end (MUV &lt; -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z &gt; 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z &gt; 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering &gt;76% of input z &gt; 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination &lt;10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z &gt; 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect &gt;100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and &gt;100 at z &gt; 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z &gt; 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV &lt; -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z &gt; 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Characterizing the Three-dimensional Structure of Two Protocluster Complexes at $z = 3.1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the 3D morphology of two extended associations of multiple protoclusters at $z=3.1$. These protocluster 'complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\log(M/M_\odot) \gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of fuzzy-dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be potentially sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.2\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$ at $2\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>A method for statistical research on binary stars using radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are fundamental to astrophysics, providing critical insights into stellar evolution, galactic dynamics, and fundamental physics. However, the high dimensionality of orbital parameters and observational constraints present significant challenges in statistically characterizing their properties. In this study, we propose and implement a novel algorithm, the Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution (DVCD), to analyze binary star systems using radial velocity data. The DVCD method demonstrates superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, reducing computation time by factors of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ under comparable conditions.
  We applied the DVCD algorithm to red giant samples from APOGEE DR16, dividing the dataset into 16 subsets based on $\log g$ and M/H. Our findings reveal that the binary fraction decreases with decreasing surface gravity and increasing metallicity, offering valuable constraints on the evolutionary processes of binary stars. This study underscores the potential of the DVCD method for large-scale statistical analyzes of binary systems.</description>

      <title>MUSE IFU observations of galaxies hosting of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z&lt;0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z&lt;0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and &gt;45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with 17 years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.9 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $&lt; 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Where Galaxies Point: First Measurement of the Large-Scale Axial Intrinsic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying a new estimator to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 weak lensing shape catalog, we map the galaxies' orientation field and report the first detection of a large-scale axial intrinsic alignment (LAIA) on dipolar angular scales. Ellipticals' semi-major axes and spirals' semi-minor axes coherently point toward a common direction, (RA,Dec)=$(306^{+6}_{-4},52^{+3}_{-3})^\circ$ and $(296^{+10}_{-18},50^{+6}_{-2})^\circ$, respectively, with amplitudes in the expected tidal-torquing hierarchy. This pattern could be produced by a horizon-scale tidal field imprinted by primordial inhomogeneities during galaxy assembly and, if confirmed, would signal a statistically significant preferred direction in the Universe, thereby probing deviations from statistical isotropy. The signal persists across spatial and redshift splits and is difficult to attribute to survey systematics. LAIA offers a new sky-wide compass linking galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>A new estimate of the zero-point shift of the Gaia DR3 parallaxes obtained from a comparison with VLBI measurements of masers and radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most complete sample of radio stars and masers with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method, common with the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR3 catalogs, has been compiled using literature data. The sample contains 151 stars. An analysis of the differences in parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia-VLBI stars has been performed. A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $\Delta\pi=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas. The obtained estimates of the relative rotation rates confirm the absence of a significant rotation of the Gaia\,DR3 system relative to the extragalactic coordinate system, which in this case is represented by VLBI measurements.</description>
