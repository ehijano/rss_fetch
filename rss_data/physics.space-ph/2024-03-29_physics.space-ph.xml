      <title>Turbulence properties and kinetic signatures of electron in Kelvin-Helmholtz waves during a geomagnetic storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft encounter with KHI during a geomagnetic storm, focusing on elucidating key turbulence properties and reconnection signatures observed at the edges of KH vortices. The spectral slope for electric field stays approximately constant for frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency and exhibits a break around the lower hybrid frequency, indicating wave activity. Furthermore, MMS observes a current sheet accompanied by intense electron jets and features consistent with strong guide-field asymmetric reconnection across the magnetopause. Substantial agyrotropy (by a factor of 10) in electron distribution functions is observed in the reconnecting current sheet and at the edges of KH. Our observation presents a multi-scale view into KH turbulence under strongly driven conditions and into the dynamics occurring at electron dissipation scales.</description>

      <title>Preliminary mapping of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) over Ecuador using global positioning system (GPS) data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionosphere affects radio signals by altering their speed, direction, and trajectory, causing a temporary delay known as ionospheric delay, which is directly related to the total electron content (TEC). Although research in other equatorial locations has explored TEC implications, qualitative research is required to predict its behavior in the ionosphere. This study aims to depict TEC intensity evolution through color maps using data from 14 GPS receivers placed across Ecuador. For this purpose, pseudorange observables collected from the stations were used to present a calculation method for the TEC and its evolution during January 2022. The results revealed an oscillatory behavior in the evolution of the TEC, with intensity peaks that, on some occasions, approach and even exceed 100 T ECU (TEC units), while its local minimums never reach zero values.</description>
