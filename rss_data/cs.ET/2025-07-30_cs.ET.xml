      <title>Toward Intelligent Electronic-Photonic Design Automation for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits: from Device Inverse Design to Physical Layout Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) offer tremendous advantages in bandwidth, parallelism, and energy efficiency, making them essential for emerging applications in artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), sensing, and communications. However, the design of modern PICs, which now integrate hundreds to thousands of components, remains largely manual, resulting in inefficiency, poor scalability, and susceptibility to errors. To address these challenges, we propose PoLaRIS, a comprehensive Intelligent Electronic-Photonic Design Automation (EPDA) framework that spans both device-level synthesis and system-level physical layout. PoLaRIS combines a robust, fabrication-aware inverse design engine with a routing-informed placement and curvy-aware detailed router, enabling the automated generation of design rule violation (DRV)-free and performance-optimized layouts. By unifying physics-driven optimization with machine learning and domain-specific algorithms, PoLaRIS significantly accelerates PIC development, lowers design barriers, and lays the groundwork for scalable photonic system design automation.</description>

      <title>Green Wave as an Integral Part for the Optimization of Traffic Efficiency and Safety: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green Wave provides practical and advanced solutions to improve traffic efficiency and safety through network coordination. Nevertheless, the complete potential of Green Wave systems has yet to be explored. Utilizing emerging technologies and advanced algorithms, such as AI or V2X, would aid in achieving more robust traffic management strategies, especially when integrated with Green Wave. This work comprehensively surveys existing traffic control strategies that enable Green Waves and analyzes their impact on future traffic management systems and urban infrastructure. Understanding previous research on traffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps explore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for effective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages of using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety issues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the existing challenges and research gaps in building robust and successful Green Wave systems are discussed to articulate explicitly the future requirement of sustainable urban transport.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive benchmark of an Ising machine on the Max-Cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QUBO formulations of combinatorial optimization problems allow for solving them using various quantum heuristics. While large-scale quantum computations are currently still out of reach, we can already numerically test such QUBO formulations on a perhaps surprisingly large scale. In this work, we benchmark Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, which captures the main complexity of the QUBO problem. We make a comprehensive benchmark against leading other heuristic algorithms on graphs with up to 53,000 variables by focusing on the wall-clock time. Moreover, we compare the DA performance against published performance results of the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical annealer and the recently proposed QIS3 heuristic. Based on performance statistics for over 2,000 graphs from the MQLib, we find that the DA yields competitive results. We hope that this benchmark demonstrates the extent to which large QUBO instances can be heuristically solved today, yielding consistent results across different solvers.</description>

      <title>Efficient handover based on Near-field and Far-field RIS for seamless connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is becoming a transformative technology for the upcoming 6G communication networks, providing a way for smartly maneuvering the electromagnetic waves to enhance coverage and connectivity. This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme leveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility management. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the considered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and derive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF region to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE) trajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories like hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing (RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed algorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the minimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain connectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the requirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO. By restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method improves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in crowded cellular networks. Numerical results highlight significant reductions in HO rates and signaling load, ensuring seamless connectivity and improved quality of service (QoS) in 6G systems.</description>

      <title>A Customized Memory-aware Architecture for Biological Sequence Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence alignment is a fundamental process in computational biology which identifies regions of similarity in biological sequences. With the exponential growth in the volume of data in bioinformatics databases, the time, processing power, and memory bandwidth for comparing a query sequence with the available databases grows proportionally. The sequence alignment algorithms often involve simple arithmetic operations and feature high degrees of inherent fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism. These features can be potentially exploited by a massive parallel processor, such as a GPU, to increase throughput. In this paper, we show that the excessive memory bandwidth demand of the sequence alignment algorithms prevents exploiting the maximum achievable throughput on conventional parallel machines. We then propose a memory-aware architecture to reduce the bandwidth demand of the sequence alignment algorithms, effectively pushing the memory wall to extract higher throughput. The design is integrated at the logic layer of an emerging 3D DRAM as a processing-in-memory architecture to further increase the available bandwidth. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture results in up to 2.4x speedup over a GPU-based design. Moreover, by moving the computation closer to the memory, power consumption is reduced by 37%, on average.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-Inspired Computing with Oscillatory Neural Networks for Inverse Matrix Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a thermodynamic-inspired computing paradigm based on oscillatory neural networks (ONNs). While ONNs have been widely studied as Ising machines for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems, this work investigates their feasibility in solving linear algebra problems, specifically the inverse matrix. Grounded in thermodynamic principles, we analytically demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation has the highest accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Expressibility for Ansatz Selection in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), selecting an appropriate ansatz is crucial for efficient problem-solving. Hamiltonian expressibility has been introduced as a metric to quantify a circuit's ability to uniformly explore the energy landscape associated with a Hamiltonian ground state search problem. However, its influence on solution quality remains largely unexplored. In this work, we estimate the Hamiltonian expressibility of a well-defined set of circuits applied to various Hamiltonians using a Monte Carlo-based approach. We analyze how ansatz depth influences expressibility and identify the most and least expressive circuits across different problem types. We then train each ansatz using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and analyze the correlation between solution quality and expressibility.Our results indicate that, under ideal or low-noise conditions and particularly for small-scale problems, ans\"atze with high Hamiltonian expressibility yield better performance for problems with non-diagonal Hamiltonians and superposition-state solutions. Conversely, circuits with low expressibility are more effective for problems whose solutions are basis states, including those defined by diagonal Hamiltonians. Under noisy conditions, low-expressibility circuits remain preferable for basis-state problems, while intermediate expressibility yields better results for some problems involving superposition-state solutions.</description>

      <title>VRISE: A Virtual Reality Platfrom for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling, and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles. Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe and engaging setting.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Processing of Constant-Depth Time Evolution Circuits in Control Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter, specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols, which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits, specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Grover-Based Quantum Algorithm for Solving Perfect Mazes via Fitness-Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states, and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like or acyclic graphs.</description>
