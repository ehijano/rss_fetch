      <title>Hopf-type theorems for convex surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study variations of the Hopf theorem concerning continuous maps $f$ of a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We investigate the case when $M$ is a closed convex $n$-dimensional surface and prove that the Hopf theorem (as well its quantitative generalization) is still valid but with the replacement of geodesic to quasigeodesic in the sense of Alexandrov (and Petrunin). Besides, we study a discrete version of the Hopf theorem. We say that a pair of points $a$ and $b$ are $f$-neighbors if $f(a) = f(b)$. We prove that if $(P,d)$ is a triangulation of a convex polyhedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$, with a metric $d$, compatable with topology of $P$, and $f \colon P \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is a simplicial map of general position, then there exists a polygonal path in the space of $f$-neighbors that connects a pair of `antipodal' points with a pair of identical points. Finally, we prove that the set of $f$-neighbors realizing a given distance $\delta &gt; 0$ (in a specific interval), has non-trivial first Steenrod homology with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>New geodesic lines in the Gromov-Hausdorff class lying in the cloud of the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we prove that, for arbitrary unbounded subset $A\subset R$ and an arbitrary bounded metric space~$X$, a curve $A\times_{\ell^1} (tX)$, $t\in[0,\,\infty)$ is a geodesic line in the Gromov--Hausdorff class. We also show that, for abitrary $\lambda &gt; 1$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the following inequality holds: $d_{GH}\bigl(\mathbb{Z}^n,\,\lambda\mathbb{Z}^n\bigr)\ge\frac{1}{2}$. We conclude that a curve $t\mathbb{Z}^n$, $t\in(0,\,\infty)$ is not continuous with respect to the Gromov--Hausdorff distance, and, therefore, is not a gedesic line. Moreover, it follows that multiplication of all metric spaces lying on the finite Gromov--Hausdorff distance from $\mathbb{R}^n$ on some~$\lambda &gt; 0$ is also discontinous with respect to the Gromov--Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Flexible polyhedral nets in isotropic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study flexible polyhedral nets in isotropic geometry. This geometry has a degenerate metric, but there is a natural notion of flexibility. We study infinitesimal and finite flexibility, and classify all finitely flexible polyhedral nets of arbitrary size. We show that there are just two classes, in contrast to Izmestiev's rather involved classification in Euclidean geometry, for size 3x3 only. Using these nets to initialize the optimization algorithms, we turn them into approximate Euclidean mechanisms. We also explore the smooth versions of these classes.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation in metric spaces: Achieving Exponential Concentration with a Fr\'echet Median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in developing statistical estimators that achieve exponential concentration around a population target even when the data distribution has heavier than exponential tails. More recent activity has focused on extending such ideas beyond Euclidean spaces to Hilbert spaces and Riemannian manifolds. In this work, we show that such exponential concentration in presence of heavy tails can be achieved over a broader class of parameter spaces called CAT($\kappa$) spaces, a very general metric space equipped with the minimal essential geometric structure for our purpose, while being sufficiently broad to encompass most typical examples encountered in statistics and machine learning. The key technique is to develop and exploit a general concentration bound for the Fr\'echet median in CAT($\kappa$) spaces. We illustrate our theory through a number of examples, and provide empirical support through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Some questions related to free-by-cyclic groups and tubular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a CAT(0) free-by-cyclic tubular group with one vertex is virtually special, but many of them cannot virtually act freely and cocompactly on CAT(0) cube complexes. This partially confirms a question of Brady--Soroko \cite[Section 9: Question 1]{BS} and answers a question of Lyman \cite[Question 1]{Ly} in the negative. Furthermore, we provide examples of free-by-cyclic groups amalgamated along cyclic subgroups that are not virtually free-by-cyclic. This answers negatively a question of Hagen--Wise \cite[Remark 3.6]{hw}. Lastly, we exhibit an example of a cyclic-subgroup-separable tubular group that does not have the property (VRC) (i.e. every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract). This answers a question of Minasyan \cite[Question 11.6]{min} in the negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the topological results of Lytchak-Nagano and Lytchak-Nagano-Stadler for CAT(0) spaces to the setting of Busemann spaces of nonpositive curvature, i.e., BNPC spaces. We give a characterization of locally BNPC topological manifolds in terms of their links and show that the singular set of a locally BNPC homology manifold is discrete. We also prove that any (globally) BNPC topological 4-manifold is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. Applications include a topological stability theorem for locally BNPC G-spaces. Our arguments also apply to spaces admitting convex geodesic bicombings.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to circle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a finite simplicial complex triangulating a disc, its Euclidean circle packings can be found by solving a system of polynomial equations. We also present a similar system of equations for unbranched circle packings. The variables in these equations are associated to corners of triangles in the complex, with one equation for each interior vertex, interior edge, and face. The vertex equations are generalisations of the Descartes circle theorem, of higher degree but more symmetric than those previously found by the authors. We also provide some connections between the spinorial approach of previous work of the authors, and classical Euclidean geometry.</description>

      <title>A universal threshold for geometric embeddings of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is geometrically embeddable into a normed space $X$ when there is a mapping $\zeta: V\to X$ such that $\|\zeta(v)-\zeta(w)\|_X\leqslant 1$ if and only if $\{v,w\}\in E$, for all distinct $v,w\in V$. Our result is the following universal threshold for the embeddability of trees. Let $\Delta \geqslant 3$, and let $N$ be sufficiently large in terms of $\Delta$. Every $N$--vertex tree of maximal degree at most $\Delta$ is embeddable into any normed space of dimension at least $64\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$, and complete trees are non-embeddable into any normed space of dimension less than $\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\log N}{\log\log N}$. In striking contrast, spectral expanders and random graphs are known to be non-embeddable in sublogarithmic dimension. Our result is based on a randomized embedding whose analysis utilizes the recent breakthroughs on Bourgain's slicing problem.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'{e} ball model for taxicab hyperbolic geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taxicab space is a modification of Euclidean space that uses an alternative notion of distance. Similarly, the Poincar\'{e} ball is a model of hyperbolic geometry that consists of a subset of Euclidean space with an alternative notion of distance. In this paper, we merge these two variations to create a taxicab version of the Poincar\'{e} ball. We determine the isometry group for this new space and show that this space is hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov.</description>

      <title>Local Blaschke--Kakutani ellipsoid characterization and Banach's isometric subspaces problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following local version of Blaschke--Kakutani's characterization of ellipsoids: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space, $B\subset V$ a convex body with 0 in its interior, and ${2\le k&lt;\dim V}$ an integer. Suppose that the body $B$ is contained in a cylinder based on the cross-section $B \cap X$ for every $k$-plane $X$ from a connected open set of linear $k$-planes in $V$. Then in the region of $V$ swept by these $k$-planes $B$ coincides with either an ellipsoid, or a cylinder over an ellipsoid, or a cylinder over a $k$-dimensional base.
  For $k=2$ and $k=3$ we obtain as a corollary a local solution to Banach's isometric subspaces problem: If all cross-sections of $B$ by $k$-planes from a connected open set are linearly equivalent, then the same conclusion as above holds.</description>

      <title>Cyclic hyperbolicity in CAT(0) cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that a cocompact special group $G$ does not contain $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ if and only if it is hyperbolic; and it does not contain $\mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$ if and only if it is toric relatively hyperbolic. Pursuing in this direction, we show that $G$ does not contain $\mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{F}_2$ if and only if it is weakly hyperbolic relative to cyclic subgroups, or cyclically hyperbolic for short. This observation motivates the study of cyclically hyperbolic groups, which we initiate in the class of groups acting geometrically on CAT(0) cube complexes. Given such a group $G$, we first prove a structure theorem: $G$ virtually splits as the direct sum of a free abelian group and an acylindrically hyperbolic cubulable group. Next, we prove a strong Tits alternative: every subgroup $H \leq G$ either is virtually abelian or it admits a series $H=H_0 \rhd H_1 \rhd \cdots \rhd H_k$ where $H_k$ is acylindrically hyperbolic and where $H_i/H_{i+1}$ is finite or free abelian. As a consequence, $G$ is SQ-universal and it cannot contain subgroups such that products of free groups and virtually simple groups.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Isoperimetric Bubbles on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-bubble isoperimetric conjecture in $n$-dimensional Euclidean and spherical spaces from the 1990's asserts that standard bubbles uniquely minimize total perimeter among all $q-1$ bubbles enclosing prescribed volume, for any $q \leq n+2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^3$ was confirmed in 2000 by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritor\'e-Ros, and is nowadays fully resolved for all $n \geq 2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and triple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^2$ have also been resolved, but all other cases are in general open. We confirm the conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on $\mathbb{S}^n$ for all $q \leq \min(5,n+1)$, namely: the double-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 2$, the triple-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 3$ and the quadruple-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 4$. In fact, we show that for all $q \leq n+1$, a minimizing cluster necessarily has spherical interfaces, and after stereographic projection to $\mathbb{S}^n$, its cells are obtained as the Voronoi cells of $q$ affine-functions, or equivalently, as the intersection with $\mathbb{S}^n$ of convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Moreover, the cells (including the unbounded one) are necessarily connected and intersect a common hyperplane of symmetry, resolving a conjecture of Heppes. We also show for all $q \leq n+1$ that a minimizer with non-empty interfaces between all pairs of cells is necessarily a standard bubble. The proof makes crucial use of considering $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ in tandem and of M\"obius geometry and conformal Killing fields; it does not rely on establishing a PDI for the isoperimetric profile as in the Gaussian setting, which seems out of reach in the present one.</description>

      <title>Realizing trees of configurations in thin sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a continuous function, smooth away from the diagonal, such that, for some $\alpha&gt;0$, the associated generalized Radon transforms \begin{equation} \label{Radon} R_t^{\phi}f(x)=\int_{\phi(x,y)=t} f(y) \psi(y) d\sigma_{x,t}(y) \end{equation} map $L^2({\mathbb R}^d) \to L^2_{\alpha}({\mathbb R}^d)$ for all $t&gt;0$. Let $E$ be a compact subset of ${\mathbb R}^d$ for some $d \ge 2$, and suppose that the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $&gt;d-\alpha$. We show that any tree graph $T$ on $k+1$ ($k \ge 1$) vertices is \new{stably} realizable in $E$, in the sense that \new{for each $t$ in some open interval} there exist distinct $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1} \in E$ %and $t&gt;0$ such that the $\phi$-distance $\phi(x^i, x^j)=t$ for all pairs $(i,j)$ corresponding to the edges of $T$.
  We extend this result to trees whose edges are prescribed by more complicated point configurations, such as congruence classes of triangles.
