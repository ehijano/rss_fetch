      <title>On the number and sizes of double cosets of Sylow subgroups of the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_n$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. We investigate the number and sizes of the $P_n\setminus S_n\ /\ P_n$ double cosets, showing that most double cosets have maximal size when $p$ is odd, or equivalently, that $P_n\cap P_n^x=1$ for most $x\in S_n$ when $n$ is large. We also find that all possible sizes of such double cosets occur, modulo a list of small exceptions.</description>

      <title>An addendum on the Mathieu Conjecture for $SU(N)$, $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we sharpen results obtained by the author in 2023. The new results reduce the Mathieu Conjecture on $SU(N)$ (formulated for all compact connected Lie groups by O. Mathieu in 1997) to a conjecture involving only functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times (S^1)^m$ with $n,m$ non-negative integers instead of involving functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times (S^1\setminus\{1\})^m$. The proofs rely on a more recent work of the author (2024) and a specific $KAK$ decomposition. Finally, with these results we can also improve the results on the groups $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$ in the latter paper, since they relied on the construction introduced in the 2023 paper.</description>

      <title>A result on certain sums of element orders in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ of order $p^nm$, where $p$ is a prime and $p\nmid m$, we denote by $\psi_p(G)$ the sum of orders of $p$-parts of elements in $G$. In the current note, we prove that $\psi_p(G)\leq\psi_p(C_{p^nm})$, where $C_{p^nm}$ is the cyclic group of order $p^nm$, and the equality holds if and only if $G$ is $p$-nilpotent of a particular type. A generalization of this result is also presented.</description>

      <title>Projections from Furstenberg boundaries onto maximal flats and barycenter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple connected Lie group of non-compact type with finite center. Let $K&lt;G$ be a maximal compact subgroup and $P&lt;G$ be a minimal parabolic subgroup. For any pair $(F,x)$, where $F$ is a maximal flat in $G/K$ and $x \in G/P$ is opposite to the Weyl chambers determined by $F$, we define a projection $\Phi(F, x) \in F$ which is continuous and $G$-equivariant. Furthermore, if $q \geq 3$, we exhibit a $G$-equivariant continuous map defined on an open subset of full measure of the space of $q$-tuples of $(G/P)^q$ with image in $G/K$. When $G$ is the orientation preserving isometries of real hyperbolic space and $q = 3$, we recover the geometric barycenter of the corresponding ideal triangle. All our proofs are constructive.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Disconnected Character Degree Graphs Satisfying P\'alfy's Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite solvable group with disconnected character degree graph $\Delta(G)$. Under these conditions, it follows from a result of P\'alfy that $\Delta(G)$ consists of two connected components. Another result of P\'alfy's gives an inequality relating the sizes of these two connected components. In this paper, we calculate the number of possible component size pairs that satisfy P\'alfy's inequality. Additionally, for a fixed positive integer $n$, the number of distinct graph orders for which exactly $n$ component size pairs satisfy P\'alfy's inequality is shown.</description>

      <title>The Poisson boundary of Thompson's group $T$ is not the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate probability measure with finite entropy on a countable group $G \leq \mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle acting proximally, minimally and topologically nonfreely on $S^1$. We prove that the circle $S^1$ endowed with its unique $\mu$-stationary probability measure is not the Poisson boundary of $(G,\mu)$. When $G$ is Thompson's group $T$ and $\mu$ is finitely supported, this answers a question posed by B. Deroin [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 2013] and A. Navas [Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, 2018].</description>

      <title>Embedding Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees into the Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isomorphism problem of regular Higman-Thompson groups was solved in arXiv:1006.1759, via embedding it into the Leavitt algebra. In this paper, we will expand these results to embed the Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees of directed graphs into the Leavitt path algebra. This embedding allows us to show that any isomorphism of rooted Leavitt path algebras induces an isomorphism between Higman-Thompson groups.</description>

      <title>Zariski-Closures of Linear Reflection Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear reflection group in the sense of Vinberg to be Zariski-dense in the ambient projective general linear group. As an application, we show that every irreducible right-angled Coxeter group of rank $N \geq 3$ virtually embeds Zariski-densely in $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for all $n \geq N$. This allows us to settle the existence of Zariski-dense surface subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for all $n \geq 3$. Among the other applications are examples of Zariski-dense one-ended finitely generated subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ that are not finitely presented for all $n \geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Some obstructions on the subgroups of the Brin-Thompson groups and a selection of twisted Brin-Thompson groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Burillo, Cleary and Roever's summary on obstructions of subgroups of Thompson's group $V,$ we explored the higher dimensional version of the groups, Brin-Thompson groups $nV$ and $SV,$ a class of infinite dimensional Brin-Thompson groups and an easy class of the twisted version of the Brin-Thompson groups $SV_G$ with some certain condition. We found that they have similar obstructions as Thompson's group $V$ on the torsion subgroups and a selection of the interesting Baumslag-Solitor groups are excluded as the subgroups of $SV$ and $SV_G.$ We also discuss a little on the group $\mathscr{S}V,$ an even larger class relaxing some of the "finiteness condition" and observe that some of the restrictions on subgroups disappear.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of mapping class groups mod powers of twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quotients of mapping class groups of punctured spheres by suitable large powers of Dehn twists, showing an analogue of Ivanov's theorem for the automorphisms of the corresponding quotients of curve graphs. Then we use this result to prove quasi-isometric rigidity of these quotients, answering a question of Behrstock, Hagen, Martin, and Sisto in the case of punctured spheres. Finally, we show that the automorphism groups of our quotients of mapping class groups are "small", as are their abstract commensurators. This is again an analogue of a theorem of Ivanov about the automorphism group of the mapping class group. In the process we develop techniques to extract combinatorial data from a quasi-isometry of a hierarchically hyperbolic space, and use them to give a different proof of a result of Bowditch about quasi-isometric rigidity of pants graphs of punctured spheres.</description>

      <title>Structure of quasiconvex virtual joins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a relatively hyperbolic group and let $Q$ and $R$ be relatively quasiconvex subgroups. It is known that there are many pairs of finite index subgroups $Q' \leqslant_f Q$ and $R' \leqslant_f R$ such that the subgroup join $\langle Q', R' \rangle$ is also relatively quasiconvex, given suitable assumptions on the profinite topology of $G$. We show that the intersections of such joins with maximal parabolic subgroups of $G$ are themselves joins of intersections of the factor subgroups $Q'$ and $R'$ with maximal parabolic subgroups of $G$. As a consequence, we show that quasiconvex subgroups whose parabolic subgroups are almost compatible have finite index subgroups whose parabolic subgroups are compatible, and provide a combination theorem for such subgroups.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all $2$-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which significantly cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched).</description>

      <title>A character approach to the ISR property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a character approach to study the invariant von Neumann subalgebras rigidity property (abbreviated as the ISR property) introduced in Amrutam-Jiang's work. First, we introduce the non-factorizable regular character property for groups and show that this implies the ISR property for any infinite ICC groups with trivial amenable radical.Various examples are shown to have this property. Second, we apply known classification results on indecomposable characters to show approximately finite groups have the ISR property. Based on this approach, we also construct non-amenable groups with the ISR property while having non-trivial amenable radical or without the non-factorizable regular character property.</description>

      <title>Homology of Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homological invariants of the Steinberg algebra $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ of an ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ over a commutative ring $k$. For $\mathcal{G}$ principal or Hausdorff with ${\mathcal{G}}^{\rm{Iso}}\setminus{\mathcal{G}}^{(0)}$ discrete, we compute Hochschild and cyclic homology of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of groupoid homology. For any ample Hausdorff groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we find that $H_*(\mathcal{G})$ is a direct summand of $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$; using this and the Dennis trace we obtain a map $\overline{D}_*:K_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))\to H_n(\mathcal{G},k)$. We study this map when $\mathcal{G}$ is the (twisted) Exel-Pardo groupoid associated to a self-similar action of a group $G$ on a graph, and compute $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$ and $H_*(\mathcal{G},k)$ in terms of the homology of $G$, and the $K$-theory of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of that of $k[G]$.</description>
