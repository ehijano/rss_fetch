      <title>A New Perspective to Fish Trajectory Imputation: A Methodology for Spatiotemporal Modeling of Acoustically Tagged Fish Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</description>

      <title>Air-HOLP: Adaptive Regularized Feature Screening for High Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling high-dimensional datasets presents substantial computational challenges, particularly when the number of features far exceeds the number of observations and when features are highly correlated. A modern approach to mitigate these issues is feature screening. In this work, the High-dimensional Ordinary Least-squares Projection (HOLP) feature screening method is advanced by employing adaptive ridge regularization. The impact of the ridge penalty on the Ridge-HOLP method is examined and Air-HOLP is proposed, a data-adaptive advance to Ridge-HOLP where the ridge-regularization parameter is selected iteratively and optimally for better feature screening performance. The proposed method addresses the challenges of penalty selection in high dimensions by offering a computationally efficient and stable alternative to traditional methods like bootstrapping and cross-validation. Air-HOLP is evaluated using simulated data and a prostate cancer genetic dataset. The empirical results demonstrate that Air-HOLP has improved performance over a large range of simulation settings. We provide R codes implementing the Air-HOLP feature screening method and integrating it into existing feature screening methods that utilize the HOLP formula.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Unadjusted Langevin in High Dimensions: Delocalization of Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is commonly used to sample probability distributions in extremely high-dimensional settings. However, existing analyses of the algorithm for strongly log-concave distributions suggest that, as the dimension $d$ of the problem increases, the number of iterations required to ensure convergence within a desired error in the $W_2$ metric scales in proportion to $d$ or $\sqrt{d}$. In this paper, we argue that, despite this poor scaling of the $W_2$ error for the full set of variables, the behavior for a small number of variables can be significantly better: a number of iterations proportional to $K$, up to logarithmic terms in $d$, often suffices for the algorithm to converge to within a desired $W_2$ error for all $K$-marginals. We refer to this effect as delocalization of bias. We show that the delocalization effect does not hold universally and prove its validity for Gaussian distributions and strongly log-concave distributions with certain sparse interactions. Our analysis relies on a novel $W_{2,\ell^\infty}$ metric to measure convergence. A key technical challenge we address is the lack of a one-step contraction property in this metric. Finally, we use asymptotic arguments to explore potential generalizations of the delocalization effect beyond the Gaussian and sparse interactions setting.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Multilevel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen data sets. We test our method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons to Stan as a gold-standard method where possible. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-COM and SIMO-SEN) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal rate-distortion (R-D) region and explore several inner (IB) and outer (OB) bounds. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: \textit{i}) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method, and \textit{ii}) a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <title>Disclosure risk assessment with Bayesian non-parametric hierarchical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro and survey datasets often contain private information about individuals, like their health status, income or political preferences. Previous studies have shown that, even after data anonymization, a malicious intruder could still be able to identify individuals in the dataset by matching their variables to external information. Disclosure risk measures are statistical measures meant to quantify how big such a risk is for a specific dataset. One of the most common measures is the number of sample unique values that are also population-unique. \cite{Man12} have shown how mixed membership models can provide very accurate estimates of this measure. A limitation of that approach is that the number of extreme profiles has to be chosen by the modeller. In this article, we propose a non-parametric version of the model, based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). The proposed approach does not require any tuning parameter or model selection step and provides accurate estimates of the disclosure risk measure, even with samples as small as 1$\%$ of the population size. Moreover, a data augmentation scheme to address the presence of structural zeros is presented. The proposed methodology is tested on a real dataset from the New York census.</description>
