      <title>Roots in the semiring of finite deterministic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite discrete-time dynamical systems (FDDS) model phenomena that evolve deterministically in discrete time. It is possible to define sum and product operations on these systems (disjoint union and direct product, respectively) giving a commutative semiring. This algebraic structure led to several works employing polynomial equations to model hypotheses on phenomena modelled using FDDS. To solve these equations, algorithms for performing the division and computing $k$-th roots are needed. In this paper, we propose two polynomial algorithms for these tasks, under the condition that the result is a connected FDDS. This ultimately leads to an efficient solution to equations of the type $AX^k=B$ for connected $X$. These results are some of the important final steps for solving more general polynomial equations on FDDS.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov complexity as a combinatorial tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov complexity is often used as a convenient language for counting and/or probabilistic existence proofs. However, there are some applications where Kolmogorov complexity is used in a more subtle way. We provide one (somehow) surprising example where an existence of a winning strategy in a natural combinatorial game is proven (and no direct proof is known).</description>

      <title>Counting overlapping pairs of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A correlation is a binary vector that encodes all possible positions of overlaps of two words, where an overlap for an ordered pair of words (u,v) occurs if a suffix of word u matches a prefix of word v. As multiple pairs can have the same correlation, it is relevant to count how many pairs of words share the same correlation depending on the alphabet size and word length n. We exhibit recurrences to compute the number of such pairs -- which is termed population size -- for any correlation; for this, we exploit a relationship between overlaps of two words and self-overlap of one word. This theorem allows us to compute the number of pairs with a longest overlap of a given length and to show that the expected length of the longest border of two words asymptotically diverges, which solves two open questions raised by Gabric in 2022. Finally, we also provide bounds for the asymptotic of the population ratio of any correlation. Given the importance of word overlaps in areas like word combinatorics, bioinformatics, and digital communication, our results may ease analyses of algorithms for string processing, code design, or genome assembly.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-Difference (Degeneracy) and Signed Tree Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dense counterpart of graph degeneracy, which extends the recently-proposed invariant symmetric difference. We say that a graph has sd-degeneracy (for symmetric-difference degeneracy) at most $d$ if it admits an elimination order of its vertices where a vertex $u$ can be removed whenever it has a $d$-twin, i.e., another vertex $v$ such that at most $d$ vertices outside $\{u,v\}$ are neighbors of exactly one of $u, v$. The family of graph classes of bounded sd-degeneracy is a superset of that of graph classes of bounded degeneracy or of bounded flip-width, and more generally, of bounded symmetric difference. Unlike most graph parameters, sd-degeneracy is not hereditary: it may be strictly smaller on a graph than on some of its induced subgraphs. In particular, every $n$-vertex graph is an induced subgraph of some $O(n^2)$-vertex graph of sd-degeneracy 1. In spite of this and the breadth of classes of bounded sd-degeneracy, we devise $\tilde{O}(\sqrt n)$-bit adjacency labeling schemes for them, which are optimal up to the hidden polylogarithmic factor. This is attained on some even more general classes, consisting of graphs $G$ whose vertices bijectively map to the leaves of a tree $T$, where transversal edges and anti-edges added to $T$ define the edge set of $G$. We call such graph representations signed tree models as they extend the so-called tree models (or twin-decompositions) developed in the context of twin-width, by adding transversal anti-edges. While computing the degeneracy of an input graph can be done in linear time, we show that deciding whether its symmetric difference is at most 8 is co-NP-complete, and whether its sd-degeneracy is at most 1 is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>First order distinguishability of sparse random graphs</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of distinguishing between two independent samples $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ of a binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ by first order (FO) sentences. Shelah and Spencer proved that, for a constant $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $G(n,n^{-\alpha})$ obeys FO zero-one law if and only if $\alpha$ is irrational. Therefore, for irrational $\alpha\in(0,1)$, any fixed FO sentence does not distinguish between $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ with asymptotical probability 1 (w.h.p.) as $n\to\infty$. We show that the minimum quantifier depth $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}$ of a FO sentence $\varphi=\varphi(\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2)$ distinguishing between $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ depends on how closely $\alpha$ can be approximated by rationals: (1) for all non-Liouville $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}=\Omega(\ln\ln\ln n)$ w.h.p.; (2) there are irrational $\alpha\in(0,1)$ with $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}$ that grow arbitrarily slowly w.h.p.; (3) $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}=O_p(\frac{\ln n}{\ln\ln n})$ for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The main ingredients in our proofs are a novel randomized algorithm that generates asymmetric strictly balanced graphs as well as a new method to study symmetry groups of randomly perturbed graphs.</description>

      <title>Constrained Flows in Networks</title>

Abstract: The support of a flow $x$ in a network is the subdigraph induced by the arcs $uv$ for which $x(uv)&gt;0$. We discuss a number of results on flows in networks where we put certain restrictions on structure of the support of the flow. Many of these problems are NP-hard because they generalize linkage problems for digraphs. For example deciding whether a network ${\cal N}=(D,s,t,c)$ has a maximum flow $x$ such that the maximum out-degree of the support $D_x$ of $x$ is at most 2 is NP-complete as it contains the 2-linkage problem as a very special case. Another problem which is NP-complete for the same reason is that of computing the maximum flow we can send from $s$ to $t$ along $p$ paths (called a maximum {\bf $p$-path-flow}) in ${\cal N}$. Baier et al. (2005) gave a polynomial time algorithm which finds a $p$-path-flow $x$ whose value is at least $\frac{2}{3}$ of the value of a optimum $p$-path-flow when $p\in \{2,3\}$, and at least $\frac{1}{2}$ when $p\geq 4$. When $p=2$, they show that this is best possible unless P=NP. We show for each $p\geq 2$ that the value of a maximum $p$-path-flow cannot be approximated by any ratio larger than $\frac{9}{11}$, unless P=NP. We also consider a variant of the problem where the $p$ paths must be disjoint. For this problem, we give an algorithm which gets within a factor $\frac{1}{H(p)}$ of the optimum solution, where $H(p)$ is the $p$'th harmonic number ($H(p) \sim \ln(p)$). We show that in the case where the network is acyclic, we can find such a maximum $p$-path-flow in polynomial time for every $p$. We determine the complexity of a number of related problems concerning the structure of flows. For the special case of acyclic digraphs, some of the results we obtain are in some sense best possible.</description>

      <title>Sequential Sweeps and High Dimensional Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the spectral gap of the down-up walk over an $n$-partite simplicial complex (also known as Glauber dynamics) cannot be better than $O(1/n)$ due to natural obstructions such as coboundaries. We study an alternative random walk over partite simplicial complexes known as the sequential sweep or the systematic scan Glauber dynamics: Whereas the down-up walk at each step selects a random coordinate and updates it based on the remaining coordinates, the sequential sweep goes through each of the coordinates one by one in a deterministic order and applies the same update operation. It is natural, thus, to compare $n$-steps of the down-up walk with a single step of the sequential sweep. Interestingly, while the spectral gap of the $n$-th power of the down-up walk is still bounded from above by a constant, under a strong enough local spectral assumption (in the sense of Gur, Lifschitz, Liu, STOC 2022) we can show that the spectral gap of this walk can be arbitrarily close to 1. We also study other isoperimetric inequalities for these walks, and show that under the assumptions of local entropy contraction (related to the considerations of Gur, Lifschitz, Liu), these walks satisfy an entropy contraction inequality.</description>

      <title>The Identity Problem in the special affine group of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09502v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider semigroup algorithmic problems in the Special Affine group $\mathsf{SA}(2, \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$, which is the group of affine transformations of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that preserve orientation. Our paper focuses on two decision problems introduced by Choffrut and Karhum\"{a}ki (2005): the Identity Problem (does a semigroup contain a neutral element?) and the Group Problem (is a semigroup a group?) for finitely generated sub-semigroups of $\mathsf{SA}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. We show that both problems are decidable and NP-complete. Since $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z}) \leq \mathsf{SA}(2, \mathbb{Z}) \leq \mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$, our result extends that of Bell, Hirvensalo and Potapov (2017) on the NP-completeness of both problems in $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$, and contributes a first step towards the open problems in $\mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>On the Paley RIP and Paley graph extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing explicit RIP matrices is an open problem in compressed sensing theory. In particular, it is quite challenging to construct explicit RIP matrices that break the square-root bottleneck. On the other hand, providing explicit $2$-source extractors is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, cryptography and combinatorics. Nowadays, there are only a few known constructions for explicit $2$-source extractors (with negligible errors) that break the half barrier for min-entropy.
  In this paper, we establish a new connection between RIP matrices breaking the square-root bottleneck and $2$-source extractors breaking the half barrier for min-entropy. Here we focus on an RIP matrix (called the Paley ETF) and a $2$-source extractor (called the Paley graph extractor), where both are defined from quadratic residues over the finite field of odd prime order $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. As a main result, we prove that if the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, then the Paley graph extractor breaks the half barrier for min-entropy as well. Since it is widely believed that the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, our result accordingly provides a new affirmative intuition on the conjecture for the Paley graph extractor by Benny Chor and Oded Goldreich.</description>
