      <title>The bulge globular cluster Terzan 6 as seen from multi-conjugate adaptive optics and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work consists of the first detailed photometric study of Terzan 6, one of the least known globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. Through the analysis of high angular resolution and multi-wavelength data obtained from adaptive optics corrected and space observations, we built deep, optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams reaching $\approx 4$ magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff. Taking advantage of 4 different epochs of observations, we measured precise relative proper motions for a large sample of stars, from which cluster members have been solidly distinguished from Galactic field interlopers. A non-canonical reddening law (with $R_V=2.85$) and high-resolution differential reddening map, with color excess variations up to $\delta E(B-V) \approx 0.8 $ mag, have been derived in the direction of the system. According to these findings, new values of the extinction and distance modulus have been obtained: respectively, $E(B-V)=2.36\pm0.05$ and $(m-M)_0=14.46 \pm 0.10$ (corresponding to $d=7.8 \pm 0.3$ kpc). We also provide the first determinations of the cluster center and projected density profile from resolved star counts. The center is offset by more than $7$ arcsec to the east from the literature value, and the structural parameters obtained from the King model fitting to the density profile indicate that Terzan 6 is in an advanced stage of its dynamical evolution. We also determined the absolute age of the system, finding $t=13\pm 1 $ Gyr, in agreement with the old ages found for the globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. From the re-determination of the absolute magnitude of the red giant branch bump and the recent estimate of the cluster global metallicity, we find that Terzan 6 nicely matches the tight relation between these two parameters drawn by the Galactic globular cluster population.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Galactic Interaction in the Small Magellanic Cloud Probed by Gaia Selected Massive Star Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present identifications and kinematic analysis of 7,426 massive ($\mathrm{\geq}8M_{\odot}$) stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using Gaia DR3 data. We used Gaia ($G_\mathrm{BP}-G_\mathrm{RP}$, $G$) color-magnitude diagram to select the population of massive stars, and parallax to omit foreground objects. The spatial distribution of the 7,426 massive star candidates is generally consistent with the spatial distribution of the interstellar medium, such as H$\alpha$ and H i emission. The identified massive stars show inhomogeneous distributions over the galaxy, showing several superstructures formed by massive stars with several hundred parsecs scale. The stellar superstructures defined by the surface density have opposite mean proper motions in the east and west, moving away from each other. Similarly, the mean line-of-sight velocities of the superstructures are larger to the southeast and smaller to the northwest. The different east-west properties of the superstructures' proper motion, line-of-sight velocity indicate that the SMC is being stretched by tidal forces and/or ram pressure from the Large Magellanic Cloud to the southeast, thereby rejecting the presence of galaxy rotation in the SMC.</description>

      <title>The life cycle of giant molecular clouds in simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we trace the complete life cycle of individual GMCs in high-resolution Milky Way-mass galaxy simulations to determine how different stellar feedback mechanisms and galactic-scale processes govern cloud lifetimes, mass evolution, and local star formation efficiency (SFE). We identify GMCs in simulated galaxies and track their evolution using cloud evolution trees. Via cloud evolution trees, we quantify the lifetimes and SFE of GMCs. We further apply our diagnostics on a suite of simulations with varying star formation and stellar feedback subgrid models and explore their impact together with galactic environments to the GMC life cycles. Our analysis reveals that GMCs undergo dynamic evolution, characterized by continuous gas accretion, gravitational collapse, and star formation, followed by disruption due to stellar feedback. The accretion process sustains the gas content throughout most of the GMC life cycles, resulting in a positive correlation between GMC lifetimes and their maximum masses. The GMC lifetimes range from a few to several tens of Myr, with two distinct dynamical modes: (1) GMCs near the galactic center experience strong tidal disturbances, prolonging their lifetimes when they remain marginally unbound; (2) those in the outer regions are less affected by tides, remain gravitationally bound, and evolve more rapidly. In all model variations, we observe that GMC-scale SFE correlates with the baryonic surface density of GMCs, consistent with previous studies of isolated GMCs. Additionally, we emphasize the critical role of galactic shear in regulating GMC-scale star formation and refine the correlation between local SFE and surface density by including its effects. These findings demonstrate how stellar feedback and galactic-scale dynamics jointly shape GMC-scale star formation in realistic galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on the Faraday rotation towards eight fast radio bursts using dense grids of polarized radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 2-4 GHz observations of polarized radio galaxies towards eight fast radio bursts (FRBs), producing grids of Faraday rotation measure (RM) sources with sky densities of 9-28 polarized sources per square degree. Using a Bayesian interpolation framework, we constrain Galactic RM fluctuations below ~ 1 degree squared angular scales around the FRB positions. Despite the positions of all eight FRBs far from the Galactic plane, we constrain previously unresolved small-scale Galactic RM structures around six of the eight FRBs. In two of these fields, we find potential changes in the sign of the Galactic RM that are not captured by previous, sparsely sampled RM grid observations. Our Galactic RM estimate towards the FRBs differs between a few rad m^-2 up to ~ 40 rad m^-2 from the all-sky Galactic RM map of Hutschenreuter et al. (2022). Extrapolating our results to the known population of polarized FRB sources, we may be incorrectly interpreting the host galaxy RM for ~ 30% of the FRB source population with current RM grid observations. Measuring small-scale Galactic RM variations is crucial for identifying FRBs in low density and weakly magnetized environments, which in turn could serve as potent probes of cosmic magnetism. This framework of reconstructing continuous Galactic RM structure from RM grid observations can be readily applied to FRBs that fall in the sky coverage of upcoming large-sky radio polarization surveys of radio galaxies, such as the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM).</description>

      <title>Dominant Role of Coplanar Inflows in Driving Disk Evolution Revealed by Gas-Phase Metallicity Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the MaNGA sample, we investigate the parameters influencing the radial gradients of gas-phase metallicity ($\nabla\log(\mathrm{O/H})$), to determine whether disk formation is primarily driven by coplanar gas inflow or by the independent evolution of distinct regions within the disk. Our results show that $\nabla \log(\mathrm{O/H})$ strongly correlates with local gas-phase metallicity at a given stellar mass, with steeper gradients observed in metal-poorer disks. This trend supports the coplanar gas inflow scenario, wherein the gas is progressively enriched by in situ star formation as it flows inward. In contrast, the radial gradient of stellar mass surface density shows very weak correlations with $\nabla \log(\mathrm{O/H})$, which is inconsistent with the independent evolution mode, where gas inflow, star formation, and metal enrichment occur independently within each annulus of the disk. Furthermore, we find that $\nabla \log(\mathrm{O/H})$ is also closely correlated with an indicator of local gas turbulence $\sigma_{\mathrm{gas}}/R_{\mathrm{e}}$, highlighting the competing roles of turbulence and coplanar inflow in shaping metallicity gradients. Our results provide indirect observational evidence supporting coplanar gas inflow as the driving mechanism for disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Observations: Insights into Star Formation Efficiency and Dust Attenuation in $z &gt; 5$ Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate early galaxy evolution by modeling self-consistently their radially-resolved evolution of gas, stars, heavy elements, and dust content. Our model successfully reproduces various observed properties of JWST-identified galaxies at $z &gt; 5$, including sizes, stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), metallicities, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios. We show that the star formation efficiency (SFE), $f_\ast \equiv {\rm SFR}/(f_{\rm b} \dot{M}_{\rm h})$, is regulated by the global equilibrium between cosmological gas inflows, star formation, and gas outflows. Our model predicts $f_\ast \lesssim 20~\%$ for galaxies with halo masses of $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{11-12}\, M_\odot$ down to $z = 5$, allowing them to reach intrinsic UV magnitudes of $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -22~{\rm mag}$; when dust attenuation is ignored, the predicted UV luminosity function (LF) at $z \sim 12$ agrees well with observations. However, our model also suggests that these galaxies would be heavily obscured by dust, with high optical depths at 1500~\AA~of $\tau_{1500} \gtrsim 10$, causing the dust-attenuated UV LF to fall significantly below the observed one. This discrepancy highlights the need for mechanisms that mitigate strong dust attenuation, such as dust evacuation from star-forming regions and/or preferential production of large dust grains. Further exploration of these processes is essential for understanding the early stages of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Where to search for supermassive binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are the anticipated byproducts of galaxy mergers and play a pivotal role in shaping galaxy evolution, gravitational wave emissions, and accretion physics. Despite their theoretical prevalence, direct observational evidence for SMBBHs remains elusive, with only a handful of candidates identified to date. This paper explores optimal strategies and key environments for locating SMBBHs, focusing on observational signatures in the broad Balmer lines. We present a preliminary analysis on a flux-limited sample of sources belonging to an evolved spectral type along the quasar main sequence, and we discuss the spectroscopic clues indicative of binary activity and highlight the critical role of time-domain spectroscopic surveys in uncovering periodic variability linked to binary systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical Models of Galaxy Formation and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a review on semi-empirical models of galaxy formation and evolution. We present a brief census of the three main modeling approaches to galaxy evolution, namely hydrodynamical simulations, semi-analytic models, and semi-empirical models (SEMs). We focus on SEMs in their different flavors, i.e. interpretative, descriptive and hybrid, discussing the peculiarities and highlighting virtues and shortcomings for each of these variants. We dissect a simple and recent hybrid SEM from our team to highlight some technical aspects. We offer some outlook on the prospective developments of SEMs. Finally, we provide a short summary of this review.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the warm molecular outflow component of type-2 quasars with SINFONI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present seeing-limited (0.8 arcsec) near-infrared integral field spectroscopy data of the type-2 quasars (QSO2s) SDSS J135646.10+102609.0 (J1356) and SDSS J143029.89+133912.1 (J1430, the Teacup), both belonging to the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. The nuclear K-band spectra (1.95-2.45 \textmu m) of these radio-quiet QSO2s reveal several $H_2$ emission lines, indicative of the presence of a warm molecular gas reservoir (T$\geq$1000 K). We measure nuclear masses of 5.9, 4.1, and 1.5 $\times 10^3~M_{\odot}$ in the inner 0.8 arcsec diameter region of the Teacup, J1356 north (J1356N), and south nuclei, respectively. The total warm $H_2$ mass budget is $\sim 4.5$ and $\sim 1.3 \times 10^4~M_{\odot}$ for the Teacup and J1356N, implying warm-to-cold molecular gas ratios of $10^{-6}$. The warm molecular gas kinematics, traced with the $H_2$1-0S(1) and S(2) emission lines, is consistent with that of the cold molecular phase, traced by ALMA CO emission at higher angular resolution (0.2 and 0.6 arcsec). In J1430, we detect the blue- and red-shifted sides of a compact warm molecular outflow extending up to 1.9 kpc and with velocities of 450 km/s. In J1356 only the red-shifted side is detected, with a radius of up to 2.0 kpc and velocity of 370 km/s. The outflow masses are 2.6 and 1.5 $\times 10^3~M_{\odot}$ for the Teacup and J1356N, and the warm-to-cold gas ratios in the outflows are 0.8 and 1 $\times 10^{-4}$, implying that the cold molecular phase dominates the mass budget. We measure warm molecular mass outflow rates of 6.2 and 2.9 $\times 10^{-4}~M_{\odot}/yr$ for the Teacup and J1356N, approximately 0.001\% of the total mass outflow rate. We find an enhancement of velocity dispersion in the $H_2$1-0S(1) residual dispersion map of the Teacup, both along and perpendicular to the compact radio jet direction. This enhanced turbulence can be reproduced by simulations of jet-ISM interactions.</description>

      <title>Galactic magnetic fields II. Applying the model to nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many spiral galaxies host magnetic fields with energy densities comparable to those of the turbulent and thermal motions of their interstellar gas. However, quantitative comparison between magnetic field properties inferred from observation and those obtained from theoretical modeling has been lacking. In Paper I we developed a simple, axisymmetric galactic dynamo model that uses various observational data as input. Here we apply our model to calculate radial profiles of azimuthally and vertically averaged magnetic field strength and pitch angle, gas velocity dispersion and scale height, turbulent correlation time and length, and the sizes of supernova remnants for the galaxies M31, M33, M51, and NGC 6946, using input data collected from the literature. Scaling factors are introduced to account for a lack of precision in both theory and observation. Despite the simplicity of our model, its outputs agree fairly well with galaxy properties inferred from observation. Additionally, we find that most of the parameter values are similar between galaxies. We extend the model to predict the magnetic field pitch angles arising from a combination of mean-field dynamo action and the winding up of the random small-scale field owing to the large-scale radial shear. We find their magnitudes to be much smaller than those of the pitch angles measured in polarized radio and far infrared emission. This suggests that effects not included in our model, such as effects associated with spiral arms, are needed to explain the pitch angle values.</description>

      <title>QZO: A Catalog of 5 Million Quasars from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are well established in the classification of quasars (QSOs). However, the advent of light curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine the Pan-STARRS (PS), AllWISE, and Gaia surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Using ZTF g-band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the PS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements. Additionally, we find that the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF dataset. We robustly classify objects fainter than the $5\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g &lt; \mathrm{n_{obs}} / 80 + 20.375$. For this sample, we run inference with added WISE observations, and find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.14$.</description>

      <title>No Evidence of Asymmetrically Enhanced Star Formation in Infalling Galaxies in UNIONS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ram pressure stripping is a well-known environmental quenching mechanism that removes gas from galaxies infalling into groups and clusters. In some extreme examples of ram pressure stripping, galaxies with extended gas tails show evidence of enhanced star formation prior to quenching. In this work we use a sample of 5277 local satellite galaxies in which a stripped tail of gas has not necessarily been observed, to quantify the strength of ram pressure-enhanced star formation and compare these results to a control sample of 8360 field galaxies. We use u-band imaging from the Ultraviolet-Near Infrared Northern Survey (UNIONS) as a star formation tracer and several metrics to quantify star formation asymmetry. We compare these results to environmental properties of the galaxy, such as their time since infall and host halo mass, to constrain the degree of ram pressure enhanced star formation as a function of environment. We find no significant differences between the satellite and the field samples. We further restrict our sample to galaxies which we most expect to be experiencing significant ram pressure but find no strong evidence of these galaxies having systematically enhanced star formation. Finally, we investigate the properties of the most asymmetric galaxies in our sample and again find no strong evidence of ram pressure-induced star formation enhancement. We conclude that any star formation enhancement must be small for infalling galaxies, suggesting that this effect is either uncommon or short-lived.</description>

      <title>A shocking outcome: Jet dynamics and polarimetric signatures of the multi-band flare in blazar OJ 248</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between $\gamma$-ray flares and blazars is a topic of active research, with few sources exhibiting distinct enough such outbursts to be able to conclusively connect them to features in their jet morphology. Here we present an investigation of the sole $\gamma$-ray flare of the blazar OJ 248 thus far, in association with its jet structure, as revealed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). We find that throughout the course of the $\gamma$-ray flare, the fractional linear polarisation increases in the jet of OJ 248, and the VLBI electric vector position angles (EVPAs) turn perpendicular to the bulk jet flow. We interpret this behaviour as a moving shock, travelling through a recollimation shock and upscattering photons via the inverse Compton scattering process, producing a $\gamma$-ray flare; we discuss possible mechanisms. Our hypothesised shock-shock interaction scenario is a viable mechanism to induce such EVPA rotations in both optical and radio bands.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Multiplicity of early B-type supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blue supergiant (BSG) domain contains a large variety of stars whose past and future evolutionary paths are still highly uncertain. Since binary interaction plays a crucial role in the fate of massive stars, investigating the multiplicity among BSGs helps shed light on the fate of such objects. We aim to estimate the binary fraction of a large sample of BSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey. In total, we selected 262 targets with spectral types B0-B3 and luminosity classes I-II. This work is based on spectroscopic data collected by the GIRAFFE instrument, mounted on the Very Large Telescope, which gathered nine epochs over three months. Our spectroscopic analysis for each target includes the individual and peak-to-peak radial velocity measurements, an investigation of the line profile variability, and a periodogram analysis to search for possible short- and long-period binaries. By applying a 20 km s$^{-1}$ threshold on the peak-to-peak radial velocities above which we would consider the star to be binary, the resulting observed spectroscopic binary fraction for our BSG sample is 23 $\pm$ 3$\%$. In addition, we derived reliable orbital periods for 41 spectroscopic binaries and potential binary candidates, among which there are 17 eclipsing binaries, including 20 SB1 and SB2 systems with periods of less than 10 days. We reported a significant drop in the binary fraction of BSGs with spectral types later than B2 and effective temperatures less than 18 kK, which could indicate the end of the main sequence phase in this temperature regime. We found no metallicity dependence in the binary fraction of BSGs, compared to existing spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Testing and Combining Transient Spectral Classification Tools on 4MOST-like Blended Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) expected to provide an influx of transient spectra when it begins observations in early 2026 we consider the potential for real-time classification of these spectra. We investigate three extant spectroscopic transient classifiers: the Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier (DASH), Next Generation SuperFit (NGSF) and SuperNova IDentification (SNID), with a focus on comparing the efficiency and purity of the transient samples they produce. We discuss our method for simulating realistic, 4MOST-like, host-galaxy contaminated spectra and determining quality cuts for each classifier used to ensure pure SN Ia samples while maintaining efficient classification in other transient classes. We investigate the classifiers individually and in combinations. We find that a combination of DASH and NGSF can produce a SN Ia sample with a purity of 99.9% while successfully classifying 70% of SNe Ia. However, it struggles to classify non-SN Ia transients. We investigate photometric cuts to transient magnitude and transient flux fraction, finding that both can be used to improve transient classification efficiencies by 7--25% depending on the transient subclass. Finally, we present an example classification plan for live classification and the predicted purities and efficiencies across five transient classes: Ia, Ibc, II, superluminous and non-supernova transients.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2014-BLG-1760: A Jupiter-Sun analogue residing in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of OGLE-2014-BLG-1760, a planetary system in the galactic bulge. We combine Keck Adaptive Optics follow-up observations in $K$-band with re-reduced light curve data to confirm the source and lens star identifications and stellar types. The re-reduced MOA dataset had an important impact on the light curve model. We find the Einstein ring crossing time of the event to be $\sim$ 2.5 days shorter than previous fits, which increases the planetary mass-ratio and decreases the source angular size by a factor of 0.25. Our OSIRIS images obtained 6 years after the peak of the event show a source-lens separation of 54.20 $\pm$ 0.23 mas, which leads to a relative proper motion of $\mu_{\rm rel}$ = 9.14 $\pm$ 0.05 mas/yr, larger than the previous light curve-only models. Our analysis shows that the event consists of a Jupiter-mass planet of $M_{\rm p}$ = 0.931 $\pm$ 0.117 $M_{\rm Jup}$ orbiting a K-dwarf star of $M_*$ = 0.803 $\pm$ 0.097 $M_{\odot}$ with a $K$-magnitude of $K_{\rm L}$ = 18.30 $\pm$ 0.05, located in the galactic bulge or bar. We also attempt to constrain the source properties using the source angular size $\theta_*$ and $K$-magnitude. Our results favor the scenario of the source being a younger star in the galactic disk, behind the galactic center, but future multicolor observations are needed to constrain the source and thus the lens properties.</description>

      <title>JADES: A large population of obscured, narrow line AGN at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the identification of 42 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (type-2 AGN) candidates in the two deepest observations of the JADES spectroscopic survey with JWST/NIRSpec. The spectral coverage and the depth of our observations allow us to select narrow-line AGNs based on both rest-frame optical and UV emission lines up to z=10. Due to the metallicity decrease of galaxies, at $z&gt;3$ the standard optical diagnostic diagrams (N2-BPT or S2-VO87) become unable to distinguish many AGN from other sources of photoionisation. Therefore, we also use high ionisation lines, such as HeII$\lambda$4686, HeII$\lambda$1640, NeIV$\lambda$2422, NeV$\lambda$3420, and NV$\lambda$1240, also in combination with other UV transitions, to trace the presence of AGN. Out of a parent sample of 209 galaxies, we identify 42 type-2 AGN (although 10 of them are tentative), giving a fraction of galaxies in JADES hosting type-2 AGN of about $20\pm3$\%, which does not evolve significantly in the redshift range between 2 and 10. The selected type-2 AGN have estimated bolometric luminosities of $10^{41.3-44.9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and host-galaxy stellar masses of $10^{7.2-9.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The star formation rates of the selected AGN host galaxies are consistent with those of the star-forming main sequence. The AGN host galaxies at z=4-6 contribute $\sim$8-30 \% to the UV luminosity function, slightly increasing with UV luminosity.</description>

      <title>NeutralUniverseMachine: How Filaments and Dark Matter Halo Influence the Galaxy Cold Gas Content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the influence of the distance to filaments and dark-matter haloes on galaxy cold-gas content in the empirical model NeutralUniverseMachine (NUM) and the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG. Methods. We used DisPerSE to identify cosmic web structures and calculate the distance of galaxies to filaments for both observations and models. We show the results of the HI and H2 mass functions, HI- and H2-halo-mass relations, HI- and H2-stellar-mass relations for galaxies in the NUM model and IllustrisTNG with different distances to filaments and compare them with observational measurements. We also show the evolution of HI and H2 mass densities at different distances to filament bins. Results. We find that how filaments affect the HI gas is generally less significant compared to the halo environment. There is a weak trend in the observations at z=0 that low-mass haloes lying closer to the filaments tend to have reduced HI masses. However, this trend reverses for massive haloes with log(Mvir/Msun) &gt; 12.5. This behaviour is accurately reproduced in the NUM model due to the dependence of HI gas on the halo formation time, but it does not appear in IllustrisTNG. The influence of filaments on the HI gas becomes slightly weaker at higher redshifts and is only significant for galaxies that reside in massive haloes in the NUM model. Filaments have almost no impact on the H2-stellar-mass relation in both models, confirming that H2 is primarily determined by the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- II. Investigating the origin of the H2 emission excess in nearby galaxies with JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H$_2$ emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H$_2$ emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H$_2$ S(3)/PAH$_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H$_2$ line widths, using the $W{\rm 80}$ parameter. From the correlations between $W{\rm 80}$ and H$_2$ S(3)/PAH${\rm 11.3\mu m}$, as well as the higher H$2$ S(5)/H$2$ S(3) and [Fe II]${\rm 5.34 \mu m}$/PAH${\rm 11.3\mu m}$ ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H$_2$ emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H$_2$. Our results indicate that the excess H$_2$ emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.</description>

Abstract: We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.</description>

      <title>Signatures of simulated spiral arms on radial actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the various implications of the spiral arms, it has been observed in the Milky Way disc that the distribution of radial actions from the Gaia Data Release 3 exhibits structures that may be related to the spiral arms. Our goal is to investigate the relationship between regions of low radial action identified in simulated discs and the location of the spiral arms, such as that suggested in Palicio et al. (2023) for the Galaxy. For a sample of 23 simulated spiral galaxies, we modelled the axisymmetric component of their gravitational potential to compute the radial action of their stellar particles using the Staeckel fudge. The spatial distribution of the radial action was then compared to the location of the spiral arms, identified as overdensities in the stellar surface density using a kernel density estimator. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the radial action distribution and the spiral arms in 18 of 23 simulated galaxies. However, notable discrepancies are observed in the remaining five, since they are profoundly out-of-equilibrium systems, such as galaxies influenced by external interactions or spiral arms still in the process of winding up. We have confirmed that, in general, there is a tendency of spatial correlation between spiral arms and stellar populations featuring low values of the radial action, as discussed in Palicio et al. (2023). However, discrepancies between features in the radial action distribution and the spiral structure can be interpreted as signatures of recent disturbances, a scenario applicable to the Milky Way. Furthermore, populations at least as old as 3 Gyr trace the spiral arms with no significant misalignment across age bins. A linear relation between the maximum value of the radial action of the spiral arms and the vertical scale-length is found, which is also satisfied by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The mass-dependent UVJ diagram at cosmic noon: A challenge for galaxy evolution models and dust radiative transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The UVJ color-color diagram is a widely used diagnostic to separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Observational data from photometric surveys reveal a strong stellar mass trend, with higher-mass star-forming galaxies being systematically more dust-reddened. Aims. We analyze the UVJ diagram in the TNG100 cosmological simulation at cosmic noon ($z\approx2$). Specifically, we focus on the trend between UVJ colors and mass which has not been reproduced in any cosmological simulation thus far. Methods. We applied the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to the TNG100 simulation to generate rest-frame UVJ fluxes. These UVJ colors were then compared to observational data from several well-studied extragalactic fields from the CANDELS/3D-HST programs, augmented by recent JWST/NIRCam photometry. Results. Quiescent and low-mass ($M_\star\lesssim10^{10.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) galaxies at cosmic noon do not require significant levels of dust reddening, as opposed to massive ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) star-forming galaxies. An extensive range of possible dust models fall short of the required dust reddening in V-J color for massive star-forming galaxies, with the simulated galaxies being too blue by $\approx0.9\,\mathrm{mag}$. Conclusions. We find that only variations in the star-to-dust geometries of the simulated galaxies can yield V-J colors that are red enough to match the observations. A toy model with isolated dust screens around younger stellar populations (with ages below $\sim1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) can reproduce the observational data, while all conventional dust radiative transfer models (where the dust distribution follows the metals in the interstellar medium) fail to achieve the required V-J colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.</description>

Abstract: The ionized interstellar medium contains au-scale (and below) structures that scatter radio waves from pulsars, resulting in scintillation. Power spectral analysis of scintillation often shows parabolic arcs, with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of the pulsar, Earth, and interstellar plasma. Here we report the discovery of 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient interstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago. The Local Bubble is cool enough in areas for sub-au density fluctuations to arise from turbulence.</description>

Abstract: By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z &gt; 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Supernova Explodability of Massive Stars</title>

Abstract: Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.</description>

      <title>CSST Large Scale Structure Analysis Pipeline: III. Emission-line Redshift Measurement for Slitless Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11536</link>

Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a forthcoming space-based optical telescope designed to co-orbit with the Chinese Space Station. With a planned slitless spectroscopic survey spanning a broad wavelength range of $255-1000$nm and an average spectral resolution exceeding 200, the CSST holds significant potential for cosmic large-scale structure analysis. In this study, we focus on redshift determinations from slitless spectra through emission line analysis within the CSST framework. Our tailored redshift measurement process involves identifying emission lines in one-dimensional slitless spectra, aligning observed wavelengths with their rest-frame counterparts from prominent galaxy emissions, and calculating wavelength shifts to determine redshifts accurately. To validate our redshift measurement algorithm, we leverage simulated spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. The outcomes demonstrate a remarkable redshift completeness exceeding 95 per cent for emission line galaxies (ELGs), alongside a purity surpassing 85 per cent. The redshift uncertainty remains impressively below than $\sim 0.001$. Notably, when concentrating on galaxies with more than three matched emission lines, the completeness of ELGs and the purity of measurable galaxies can reach 98 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the influence of parameters like magnitude, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift on redshift completeness and purity. The discussion also delves into redshift degeneracies stemming from emission-line matching confusion. Our developed redshift measurement process will be applied to extensive simulated datasets and forthcoming CSST slitless spectroscopic observations for further cosmological and extragalactic analyses.</description>
