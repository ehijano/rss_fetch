      <title>Controlling independently the heading and the position of a Dubins car using Lie brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a control approach to follow a trajectory for a Dubins car controlling the heading independently. The difficulty is that the Dubins car should have a heading corresponding to the argument of the vector speed of the vehicle. This non holonomic constraint can be relaxed thanks to a specific control which uses Lie brackets. We will show such a control will allow us, at least from a theoretical point of view, to control independently the moving position of the car and the heading.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Opinion Dynamics with Heterogeneous Bounded Confidences and Random Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a heterogeneous multidimensional bounded confidence (BC) opinion dynamics with random pairwise interactions, whereby each pair of agents accesses each other's opinions with a specific probability. This revised model is motivated by the observation that the standard Hegselmann-Krause (HK) dynamics requires unrealistic all-to-all interactions at certain configurations. For this randomized BC opinion dynamics, regardless of initial opinions and positive confidence bounds, we show that the agents' states converge to fixed final opinions in finite time almost surely and that the convergence rate follows a negative exponential distribution in mean square. Furthermore, we establish sufficient conditions for the heterogeneous BC opinion dynamics with random interactions to achieve consensus in finite time.</description>

      <title>Nuevo modelo para el dimensionamiento de lotes de pedidos en funci\'on del volumen de compra y deterioro temporal de los art\'iculos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents the development of a new simulation model to determine the optimal order lot sizes in Material Requirements Planning, based on purchase volume and the temporal deterioration of items. The scientific novelty lies in the exhaustive enumeration of all supply strategies, considering when and how much raw material and/or inputs to acquire while simultaneously managing multiple factors. The developed model enables obtaining and visualizing all feasible solutions, though a significant challenge arises when dealing with larger planning horizons. The methodology includes formulating a mathematical equation to calculate the total cost of all supply strategies, taking into account quantity discounts and the maximum allowable shelf life of inventory items. The results demonstrate that the model thoroughly explores the entire search space and identifies the optimal solution. Validation is conducted using the tabu search heuristic, a widely recognized optimization technique. While the heuristic converges toward the global minimum, it requires a significantly higher computational load. In contrast, the developed model identifies the global minimum with fewer calculations, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic capacity allocation of hybrid transportation units for cargo-hitching in urban public transportation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the utilization of public transportation systems (PTSs) during off-peak hours, we present an algorithmic framework that designs PTSs with hybrid transportation units (HTUs), which can transport passengers or freight by leveraging a flexible interior. Against this background, we study a capacitated network design problem to enable cargo-hitching in existing PTSs. Specifically, we study a setting with fixed vehicle routes and timetables in which vehicles can be equipped with HTUs to enable cargo-hitching. We optimize the network design from a total cost perspective to account for normalized network design costs tied to the investment in HTUs and freight routing costs. We present an algorithmic framework that encodes some of the problem's constraints in a spatially and temporally expanded, layered graph, and solves the resulting network design problem with a price-and-branch algorithm. We apply this framework to a case study based on the subway network in the city of Munich. Our algorithm outscales commercial solvers by a factor of six and yields integer feasible solutions with a median integrality gap of less than 1.02% for all instances. We show that cargo-hitching with HTUs increases the utilization of PTSs, especially during off-peak hours, without cannibalizing passenger service level and quality. Moreover, we present a sensitivity analysis that indicates that cargo-hitching is worthwhile if truck-based transport occurs at an externality cost of more than EUR 1.6 per vehicle and kilometer and loading and unloading costs of less than EUR 2 per passenger equivalent.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven LQR with Finite-Time Experiments via Extremum-Seeking Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR (EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system matrices, cost matrices, and state measurements. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an induction motor.</description>

      <title>Methods with Local Steps and Random Reshuffling for Generally Smooth Non-Convex Federated Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-convex Machine Learning problems typically do not adhere to the standard smoothness assumption. Based on empirical findings, Zhang et al. (2020b) proposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption, though it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for standard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of Federated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on additional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial participation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive assumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on the proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient clipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the Polyak-{\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known results for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Koopman approximants for control: Flexible sampling, error analysis, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the extremely popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. The main features of the method are flexible sampling, regularization-based robustness, and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids. In addition, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived uniform bounds on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimal Contribution Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal contribution selection (OCS) is a selective breeding method that manages the conversion of genetic variation into genetic gain to facilitate short-term competitiveness and long-term sustainability in breeding programmes. Traditional approaches to OCS do not account for uncertainty in input data, which is always present and challenges optimization and practical decision making. Here we use concepts from robust optimization to derive a robust OCS problem and develop two ways to solve the problem using either conic optimization or sequential quadratic programming. We have developed the open-source Python package 'robustocs' that leverages the Gurobi and HiGHS solvers to carry out these methods. Our testing shows favourable performance when solving the robust OCS problem using sequential quadratic programming and the HiGHS solver.</description>

      <title>Extracting Dual Solutions via Primal Optimizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general method to convert a "primal" black-box algorithm for solving regularized convex-concave minimax optimization problems into an algorithm for solving the associated dual maximin optimization problem. Our method adds recursive regularization over a logarithmic number of rounds where each round consists of an approximate regularized primal optimization followed by the computation of a dual best response. We apply this result to obtain new state-of-the-art runtimes for solving matrix games in specific parameter regimes, obtain improved query complexity for solving the dual of the CVaR distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, and recover the optimal query complexity for finding a stationary point of a convex function.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Dynamics Using Online Adaptive Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a methodology for adaptive data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) using Koopman operators. While MPC is ubiquitous in various fields of engineering, the controller performance can deteriorate if the modeling error between the control model and the true dynamics persists, which may often be the case with complex nonlinear dynamics. Adaptive MPC techniques learn models online such that the controller can compensate for the modeling error by incorporating newly available data. We utilize the Koopman operator framework to formulate an adaptive MPC technique that corrects for model discrepancies in a computationally efficient manner by virtue of convex optimization. With the use of neural networks to learn embedding spaces, Koopman operator models enable accurate dynamics modeling. Such complex model forms, however, often lead to unstable online learning. To this end, the proposed method utilizes the soft update of target networks, a technique used in stabilization of model learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Also, we provide a discussion on which parameters to be chosen as online updated parameters based on a specific description of linear embedding models. Numerical simulations on a canonical nonlinear dynamical system show that the proposed method performs favorably compared to other data-driven MPC methods while achieving superior computational efficiency through the utilization of Koopman operators.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Koopman Operator-based Prediction and Control Using Model Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a data-driven Koopman operator-based modeling method using a model averaging technique. While the Koopman operator has been used for data-driven modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics, it is challenging to accurately reconstruct unknown dynamics from data and perform different decision-making tasks, mainly due to its infinite dimensionality and difficulty of finding invariant subspaces. We utilize ideas from a Bayesian inference-based model averaging technique to devise a data-driven method that first populates multiple Koopman models starting with a feature extraction using neural networks and then computes point estimates of the posterior of predicted variables. Although each model in the ensemble is not likely to be accurate enough for a wide range of operating points or unseen data, the proposed weighted linear embedding model combines the outputs of model ensemble aiming at compensating the modeling error of each model so that the overall performance will be improved.</description>

      <title>Impact Of Income And Leisure On Optimal Portfolio, Consumption, Retirement Decisions Under Exponential Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem encompassing investment, consumption, and retirement decisions under exponential (CARA-type) utility. The financial market comprises a bond with constant drift and a stock following geometric Brownian motion. The agent receives continuous income, consumes over time, and has the option to retire irreversibly, gaining increased leisure post-retirement compared to pre-retirement. The objective is to maximize the expected exponential utility of weighted consumption and leisure over an infinite horizon. Using a martingale approach and dual value function, we derive implicit solutions for the optimal portfolio, consumption, and retirement time. The analysis highlights key contributions: first, the equivalent condition for no retirement is characterized by a specific income threshold; second, the influence of income and leisure levels on optimal portfolio, consumption, and retirement decisions is thoroughly examined. These results provide valuable insights into the interplay between financial and lifestyle choices in retirement planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic utility maximization games under relative performance concerns in both finite-agent and infinite-agent (graphon) settings. An incomplete market model is considered where agents with power (CRRA) utility functions trade in a common risk-free bond and individual stocks driven by both common and idiosyncratic noise. The Nash equilibrium for both settings is characterized by forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with a quadratic growth generator, where the solution of the graphon game leads to a novel form of infinite-dimensional McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs. Under mild conditions, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium for both the graphon game and the $n$-agent game without common noise. Furthermore, we establish a convergence result showing that, with modest assumptions on the sensitivity matrix, as the number of agents increases, the Nash equilibrium and associated equilibrium value of the finite-agent game converge to those of the graphon game.</description>

      <title>Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Concentration of Opinion Dynamics in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion and belief dynamics are a central topic in the study of social interactions through dynamical systems. In this work, we study a model where, at each discrete time, all the agents update their opinion as an average of their intrinsic opinion and the opinion of their neighbors. While it is well-known how to compute the stable opinion state for a given network, studying the dynamics becomes challenging when the network is uncertain. Motivated by the task of finding optimal policies by a decision-maker that aims to incorporate the opinion of the agents, we address the question of how well the stable opinions can be approximated when the underlying network is random.
  We consider Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs to model the uncertain network. Under the connectivity regime and an assumption of minimal stubbornness, we show the expected value of the stable opinion $\mathbf{E}(x(G,\infty))$ concentrates, as the size of the network grows, around the stable opinion $\bar{x}(\infty)$ obtained by considering a mean-field dynamical system, i.e., averaging over the possible network realizations. For both the directed and undirected graph model, the concentration holds under the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm to measure the gap between $\mathbf{E}(x(G,\infty))$ and $\bar{x}(\infty)$. We deduce this result by studying a mean-field approximation of general analytic matrix functions. The approximation result for the directed graph model also holds for any $\ell_{\rho}$-norm with $\rho\in (1,\infty)$, under a slightly enhanced expected average degree.</description>

Abstract: We consider a Schr\"odinger bridge problem where the Markov process is subject to parameter perturbations, forming an ensemble of systems. Our objective is to steer this ensemble from the initial distribution to the final distribution using controls robust to the parameter perturbations. Utilizing the path integral formalism, we demonstrate that the optimal control is a non-Markovian strategy, specifically a stochastic feedforward control, which depends on past and present noise. This unexpected deviation from established strategies for Schr\"odinger bridge problems highlights the intricate interrelationships present in the system's dynamics. From the perspective of optimal transport, a significant by-product of our work is the demonstration that, when the evolution of a distribution is subject to parameter perturbations, it is possible to robustly deform the distribution to a desired final state using stochastic feedforward controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the existence of equilibria for ResNet type Mean Field Games problems. We introduce a relaxed Lagrangian approach on the Wasserstein space to handle the non-convex optimization problem of mean field type. We prove the existence of new relaxed Nash equilibria and we show that our existence result encompasses the classical Mean Field Games problem's existence result under convex data conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparison between tensor methods and neural networks in electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article compares the tensor method density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) with two neural network based methods -namely FermiNet and PauliNet) for determining the ground state wavefunction of the  many-body electronic Schr{\"o}dinger problem. We provide numerical simulations illustrating the main features of the methods and showing convergence with respect to some parameter, such as the rank for DMRG, and number of pretraining iterations for neural networks. We then compare the obtained energy with the methods for a few atoms and molecules, for some of which the exact value of the energy is known for the sake of comparison. In the last part of the article, we propose a new kind of neural network to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger problem based on the training of the wavefunction on a simplex, and an explicit permutation for evaluating the wavefunction on the whole space. We provide numerical results on a toy problem for the sake of illustration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Action Restless Bandits with Weakly Coupled Constraints: Simultaneous Learning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system with finitely many groups of multi-action bandit processes, each of which is a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action spaces and potentially different transition matrices when taking different actions. The bandit processes of the same group share the same state and action spaces and, given the same action that is taken, the same transition matrix. All the bandit processes across various groups are subject to multiple weakly coupled constraints over their state and action variables. Unlike the past studies that focused on the offline case, we consider the online case without assuming full knowledge of transition matrices and reward functions a priori and propose an effective scheme that enables simultaneous learning and control. We prove the convergence of the relevant processes in both the timeline and the number of the bandit processes, referred to as the convergence in the time and the magnitude dimensions. Moreover, we prove that the relevant processes converge exponentially fast in the magnitude dimension, leading to exponentially diminishing performance deviation between the proposed online algorithms and offline optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose deep learning methods for classical Monge's optimal mass transportation problems, where where the distribution constraint is treated as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures. We prove that the transport maps given by the proposed methods converge to optimal transport maps in the problem with $L^2$ cost. Several numerical experiments validate our methods. In particular, we show that our methods are applicable to large-scale Monge problems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Mobile Target Tracking Using Consensus-Based Estimation with Nearly-Constant-Velocity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF) integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error (MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Resilient Timed Elastic Band Planner for Collision-Free Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In autonomous navigation, trajectory replanning, refinement, and control command generation are essential for effective motion planning. This paper presents a resilient approach to trajectory replanning addressing scenarios where the initial planner's solution becomes infeasible. The proposed method incorporates a hybrid A* algorithm to generate feasible trajectories when the primary planner fails and applies a soft constraints-based smoothing technique to refine these trajectories, ensuring continuity, obstacle avoidance, and kinematic feasibility. Obstacle constraints are modelled using a dynamic Voronoi map to improve navigation through narrow passages. This approach enhances the consistency of trajectory planning, speeds up convergence, and meets real-time computational requirements. In environments with around 30\% or higher obstacle density, the ratio of free space before and after placing new obstacles, the Resilient Timed Elastic Band (RTEB) planner achieves approximately 20\% reduction in traverse distance, traverse time, and control effort compared to the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) planner. These improvements demonstrate the RTEB planner's potential for application in field robotics, particularly in agricultural and industrial environments, where navigating unstructured terrain is crucial for ensuring efficiency and operational resilience.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lattice $(d,k)$-polytope is the convex hull of a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose coordinates are integers ranging between $0$ and $k$. We consider the smallest possible distance $\varepsilon(d,k)$ between two disjoint lattice $(d,k)$-polytopes. We propose an algebraic model for this distance and derive from it an explicit formula for $\varepsilon(2,k)$. Our model also allows for the computation of previously intractable values of $\varepsilon(d,k)$. In particular, we compute $\varepsilon(3,k)$ when $4\leq{k}\leq8$, $\varepsilon(4,k)$ when $2\leq{k}\leq3$, and $\varepsilon(6,1)$.</description>

      <title>Strong SDP based bounds on the cutwidth of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a linear ordering of the vertices of a graph, the cutwidth of a vertex $v$ with respect to this ordering is the number of edges from any vertex before $v$ (including $v$) to any vertex after $v$ in this ordering. The cutwidth of an ordering is the maximum cutwidth of any vertex with respect to this ordering. We are interested in finding the cutwidth of a graph, that is, the minimum cutwidth over all orderings, which is an NP-hard problem. In order to approximate the cutwidth of a given graph, we present a semidefinite relaxation. We identify several classes of valid inequalities and equalities that we use to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. These classes are on the one hand the well-known 3-dicycle equations and the triangle inequalities and on the other hand we obtain inequalities from the squared linear ordering polytope and via lifting the linear ordering polytope. The solution of the semidefinite program serves to obtain a lower bound and also to construct a feasible solution and thereby having an upper bound on the cutwidth.
  In order to evaluate the quality of our bounds, we perform numerical experiments on graphs of different sizes and densities. It turns out that we produce high quality bounds for graphs of medium size independent of their density in reasonable time. Compared to that, obtaining bounds for dense instances of the same quality is out of reach for solvers using integer linear programming techniques.</description>

Abstract: We develop and analyze stochastic inexact Gauss-Newton methods for nonlinear least-squares problems and inexact Newton methods for nonlinear systems of equations. Random models are formed using suitable sampling strategies for the matrices involved in the deterministic models. The analysis of the expected number of iterations needed in the worst case to achieve a desired level of accuracy in the first-order optimality condition provides guidelines for applying sampling and enforcing, with fixed probability, a suitable accuracy in the random approximations. Results of the numerical validation of the algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Multi-period Stochastic Network Design for Combined Natural Gas and Hydrogen Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen is produced from water using renewable electricity. Unlike electricity, hydrogen can be stored in large quantities for long periods. This storage ability acts as a green battery, allowing solar and wind energy to be generated and used at different times. As a result, green hydrogen plays a central role in facilitating a climate-neutral economy. However, the logistics for hydrogen are complex. As new hydrogen pipelines are developed for hydrogen, there is a trend toward repurposing the natural gas network for hydrogen, due to its economic and environmental benefits. Yet, a rapid conversion could disrupt the balance of natural gas supply and demand. Furthermore, technical and economic developments surrounding the transition contribute additional complexity, which introduces uncertainty in future supply and demand levels for both commodities. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-period stochastic network design problem for the transition of a natural gas pipeline network into a green hydrogen pipeline network. We develop a progressive-hedging-based metaheuristic to solve the problem. Results demonstrate our matheuristic is efficient, both in computation time and in solution quality. We show that factoring in uncertainty avoids premature expansion and ensures the development of an adequate pipeline network meeting long-term needs. In a case study in the Northern Netherlands for Hydrogen Energy Applications in Valley Environments for Northern Netherlands initiative, we focus on two key scenarios: local production and importation, exploring their impacts on performance indicators. Our case insights exemplify the solid foundation for strategic decision-making in energy transitions through our approach.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider copositive cones over symmetric cones and show that they are never facially exposed when the underlying cone has dimension at least 2.

      <title>Measurized Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore lifting Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to the space of probability measures and consider the so-called measurized MDPs - deterministic processes where states are probability measures on the original state space, and actions are stochastic kernels on the original action space. We show that measurized MDPs are a generalization of stochastic MDPs, thus the measurized framework can be deployed without loss of fidelity. Bertsekas and Shreve studied similar deterministic MDPs under the discounted infinite-horizon criterion in the context of universally measurable policies. Here, we also consider the long-run average reward case, but we cast lifted MDPs within the semicontinuous-semicompact framework of Hern\'andez-Lerma and Lasserre. This makes the lifted framework more accessible as it entails (i) optimal Borel-measurable value functions and policies, (ii) reasonably mild assumptions that are easier to verify than those in the universally-measurable framework, and (iii) simpler proofs. In addition, we showcase the untapped potential of lifted MDPs by demonstrating how the measurized framework enables the incorporation of constraints and value function approximations that are not available from the standard MDP setting. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algebraic lifting procedure for any MDP, showing that non-deterministic measure-valued MDPs can emerge from lifting MDPs impacted by external random shocks.</description>

      <title>Convergence of ZH-type nonmonotone descent method for Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel iterative framework for minimizing a proper lower semicontinuous Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) function $\Phi$. It comprises a Zhang-Hager (ZH-type) nonmonotone decrease condition and a relative error condition. Hence, the sequence generated by the ZH-type nonmonotone descent methods will fall within this framework. Any sequence conforming to this framework is proved to converge to a critical point of $\Phi$. If in addition $\Phi$ has the KL property of exponent $\theta\!\in(0,1)$ at the critical point, the convergence has a linear rate for $\theta\in(0,1/2]$ and a sublinear rate of exponent $\frac{1-\theta}{1-2\theta}$ for $\theta\in(1/2,1)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish the full convergence of the iterate sequence generated by a ZH-type nonmonotone descent method for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems. The obtained results are also applied to achieve the full convergence of the iterate sequences produced by the proximal gradient method and Riemannian gradient method with the ZH-type nonmonotone line-search.</description>

      <title>A simple and practical adaptive trust-region method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an adaptive trust-region method for unconstrained optimization that allows inexact solutions to the trust-region subproblems. Our method is a simple variant of the classical trust-region method of Sorensen [1]. The method achieves the best possible convergence bound up to an additive log factor, for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point, i.e., $O( \Delta_f L^{1/2} \epsilon^{-3/2}) + \tilde{O}(1)$ iterations where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, $\Delta_f$ is the optimality gap, and $\epsilon$ is the termination tolerance for the gradient norm. This improves over existing trust-region methods whose worst-case bound is at least a factor of $L$ worse. We compare our performance with state-of-the-art trust-region (TRU) and cubic regularization (ARC) methods from the GALAHAD library on the CUTEst benchmark set on problems with more than 100 variables. We use fewer function, gradient, and Hessian evaluations than these methods. For instance, our algorithm's median number of gradient evaluations is $23$ compared to $36$ for TRU and $29$ for ARC.
  Compared to the conference version of this paper [2], our revised method includes practical enhancements and a refined subproblems termination criterion. These modifications dramatically improved performance, including an order of magnitude reduction in the shifted geometric mean of wall-clock times.</description>

      <title>Scaled Relative Graph of Normal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.02061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) is a geometric tool that maps the action of a multi-valued nonlinear operator onto the 2D plane, used to analyze the convergence of a wide range of iterative methods. As the SRG includes the spectrum for linear operators, we can view the SRG as a generalization of the spectrum to multi-valued nonlinear operators. In this work, we further study the SRG of linear operators and characterize the SRG of block-diagonal and normal matrices.</description>

      <title>Entropy Regularization and Faster Decremental Matching in General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm that maintains, against an adaptive adversary, a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum matching in $n$-node $m$-edge general (not necessarily bipartite) undirected graph undergoing edge deletions with high probability with (amortized) $O(\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}, \log n))$ time per update. We also obtain the same update time for maintaining a fractional approximate weighted matching (and hence an approximation to the value of the maximum weight matching) and an integral approximate weighted matching in dense graphs. Our unweighted result improves upon the prior state-of-the-art which includes a $\mathrm{poly}(\log{n}) \cdot 2^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ update time [Assadi-Bernstein-Dudeja 2022] and an $O(\sqrt{m} \varepsilon^{-2})$ update time [Gupta-Peng 2013], and our weighted result improves upon the $O(\sqrt{m}\varepsilon^{-O(1/\varepsilon)}\log{n})$ update time due to [Gupta-Peng 2013].
  To obtain our results, we generalize a recent optimization approach to dynamic algorithms from [Jambulapati-Jin-Sidford-Tian 2022]. We show that repeatedly solving entropy-regularized optimization problems yields a lazy updating scheme for fractional decremental problems with a near-optimal number of updates. To apply this framework we develop optimization methods compatible with it and new dynamic rounding algorithms for the matching polytope.</description>

      <title>An L-BFGS-B approach for linear and nonlinear system identification under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization for reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability), and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.</description>

      <title>Forward Reachability for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Stochastic Systems via Mixed-Monotonicity and Stochastic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to overapproximate forward stochastic reach sets of discrete-time, stochastic nonlinear systems with interval geometry. This is made possible by extending the theory of mixed-monotone systems to incorporate stochastic orders, and a concentration inequality result that lower-bounds the probability the state resides within an interval through a monotone mapping. Then, we present an algorithm to compute the overapproximations of forward reachable set and the probability the state resides within it. We present our approach on two aerospace examples to show its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Distributed Binary Optimization with In-Memory Computing: An Application for the SAT Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) has been shown to be a promising approach for solving binary optimization problems while significantly reducing energy and latency. Building on the advantages of parallel computation, we propose an IMC-compatible parallelism framework inspired by parallel tempering (PT), enabling cross-replica communication to improve the performance of IMC solvers. This framework enables an IMC solver not only to improve performance beyond what can be achieved through parallelization, but also affords greater flexibility for the search process with low hardware overhead. We justify that the framework can be applied to almost any IMC solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, using the WalkSAT heuristic as a proxy for existing IMC solvers. The resulting PT-inspired cooperative WalkSAT (PTIC-WalkSAT) algorithm outperforms the traditional WalkSAT heuristic in terms of the iterations-to-solution in 76.3% of the tested problem instances and its na\"ive parallel variant (PA-WalkSAT) does so in 68.4% of the instances. An estimate of the energy overhead of the PTIC framework for two hardware accelerator architectures indicates that in both cases the overhead of running the PTIC framework would be less than 1% of the total energy required to run each accelerator.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Finite Space Mean-Field Type Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field type games (MFTGs) describe Nash equilibria between large coalitions: each coalition consists of a continuum of cooperative agents who maximize the average reward of their coalition while interacting non-cooperatively with a finite number of other coalitions. Although the theory has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We start by proving that MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based on quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in 5 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>HyperDPO: Conditioned One-Shot Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e. fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose the HyperDPO framework, a conditioned one-shot fine-tuning approach that extends the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By substituting the Bradley-Terry-Luce model in DPO with the Plackett-Luce model, our framework is capable of handling a wide range of MOFT tasks that involve listwise ranking datasets. Compared with previous approaches, HyperDPO enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front of auxiliary objectives, and offers post-training control over trade-offs. Additionally, we propose a novel Hyper Prompt Tuning design, that conveys continuous importance weight across objectives to transformer-based models without altering their architecture, and investigate the potential of temperature-conditioned networks for enhancing the flexibility of post-training control. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the HyperDPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.</description>
