      <title>RAID-0e: A Resilient Striping Array Architecture for Balanced Performance and Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel disk array architecture, designated RAID-0e (Resilient Striping Array), designed to superimpose a low-overhead fault tolerance layer upon traditional RAID 0 (striping). By employing a logically and physically separate parity domain to protect a primary data domain, RAID-0e mitigates the risk of array-wide data loss from common, non-catastrophic media failures, such as isolated bad blocks, transient read errors, or sector-level corruption. The architecture is engineered to preserve the intrinsic read performance advantages of RAID 0 while significantly enhancing data availability and operational resilience. This document provides a comprehensive exposition of the architectural principles, operational workflows, performance characteristics, failure mode analysis, and security considerations of RAID-0e. It is presented as an experimental yet pragmatic solution for environments seeking a new equilibrium between I/O performance, storage cost, and data resilience, particularly where full drive failure is a secondary concern to media degradation.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Simulation of a Financial Market with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world stock markets, certain chart patterns -- such as price declines near historical highs -- cannot be fully explained by fundamentals alone. These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions. In this framework, (1) buy/sell decisions are made by LLMs based on individual situations, while (2) order price and volume follow standard rule-based methods. Simulations show that FCLAgents reproduce path-dependent patterns that conventional agents fail to capture. Furthermore, an analysis of FCLAgents' behavior reveals that the reference points guiding loss aversion vary with market trajectories, highlighting the potential of LLM-based agents to model nuanced investor behavior.</description>

      <title>Constrained Sensing and Reliable State Estimation with Shallow Recurrent Decoders on a TRIGA Mark II Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel data-driven methodology able to provide accurate state estimation in engineering systems, such as nuclear reactors. This deep learning architecture is a robust technique designed to map the temporal trajectories of a few sparse measures to the full state space, including unobservable fields, which is agnostic to sensor positions and able to handle noisy data through an ensemble strategy, leveraging the short training times and without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Following its application to a novel reactor concept, this work investigates the performance of Shallow Recurrent Decoders when applied to a real system. The underlying model is represented by a fluid dynamics model of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor; the architecture will use both synthetic temperature data coming from the numerical model and leveraging experimental temperature data recorded during a previous campaign. The objective of this work is, therefore, two-fold: 1) assessing if the architecture can reconstruct the full state of the system (temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulence quantities) given sparse data located in specific, low-dynamics channels and 2) assessing the correction capabilities of the architecture (that is, given a discrepancy between model and data, assessing if sparse measurements can provide some correction to the architecture output). As will be shown, the accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field, using both synthetic and experimental data, in real-time makes this approach suitable for interpretable monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the International Workshop on Verification of Scientific Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This volume contains the proceedings of the Verification of Scientific Software (VSS 2025) workshop, held on 4 May 2025 at McMaster University, Canada, as part of ETAPS 2025. VSS brings together researchers in software verification and scientific computing to address challenges in ensuring the correctness and reliability of large-scale scientific codes. The program featured five peer-reviewed papers, three invited contributions, and a set of challenge problems, covering themes such as deductive verification, floating-point error analysis, specification of coupled models, and domain-aware testing. VSS builds on the Correctness Workshop series at Supercomputing and the 2023 NSF/DOE report on scientific software correctness. It serves as yet another snapshot of this important area, showcasing a wide range of perspectives, problems and their solutions in progress, with the challenge problems having the potential to bring together separate verification tools into concerted action.</description>

      <title>Time Travel is Cheating: Going Live with DeepFund for Real-Time Fund Investment Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing, inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture, DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present limitations of LLMs for active fund management. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKUSTDial/DeepFund.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Multimodal Hierarchy of Public Transit Systems Using Itinerary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As urban mobility integrates traditional and emerging modes, public transit systems are becoming increasingly complex. Some modes complement each other, while others compete, influencing users' multimodal itineraries. To provide a clear, high-level understanding of these interactions, we introduce the concept of a macroscopic multimodal hierarchy. In this framework, trips follow an "ascending-descending" order, starting and ending with lower hierarchical modes (e.g., walking) that offer high accessibility, while utilizing higher modes (e.g., subways) for greater efficiency. We propose a methodology to identify the multimodal hierarchy of a city using multimodal smart card itinerary data and demonstrate its application with actual data collected from Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area in South Korea.</description>

      <title>Health-promoting Potential of Parks in 35 Cities Worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban parks are important for public health, but the role of specific spaces, such as playgrounds or lakes, and elements, such as benches or sports equipment, in supporting well-being is not well understood. Based on expert input and a review of the literature, we defined six types of health-related activities: physical, mindfulness, nature appreciation, environmental, social, and cultural. We built a lexicon that links each activity to specific elements and spaces within parks present in OpenStreetMap. Using this data, we scored 23,477 parks across 35 cities worldwide based on their ability to support these activities. We found clear patterns: parks in North America focus more on physical activity, while those in Europe offer more chances to enjoy nature. Parks near city centers support health-promoting activities better than those farther out. Suburban parks in many cities lack the spaces and equipment needed for nature-based, social, and cultural activities. We also found large gaps in park quality between cities. Tokyo and Paris provide more equal access, while Copenhagen and Rio de Janeiro show sharp contrasts. These results can help cities create fairer parks that better support public health.</description>
