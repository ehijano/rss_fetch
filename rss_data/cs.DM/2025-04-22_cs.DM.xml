      <title>Discrete Evacuation in Graphs with Multiple Exits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following discrete evacuation model. The evacuation terrain is modeled by a simple graph $G=(V,E)$ whose certain vertices $X\subseteq V$ are called \emph{exits}. Initially, each vertex is either \emph{empty} or \emph{occupied} by an agent. We assume that each vertex has a unique \emph{id} (and therefore the agents do have unique ids), each agent has finite but arbitrarily large memory, and the graph is initially stored in the memory of each agent. In other words, the agents do know the topology of the network along with the locations of the exits, but they do not know the initial positions nor the quantity of other agents. The time is divided into \emph{steps}; in each step any pair of agents present at vertices at a distance of at most two can exchange an arbitrary number of messages, and then each agent can either make a move or stay put. The agents should make moves in a collision-free manner, i.e., no two agents can be located at the same vertex in the same step. At the end of each step, any agent located at an exit \emph{evacuates}, i.e., it is removed from the graph. The goal is to provide an algorithm to the agents (referred to as an evacuation strategy) that ensures the evacuation of all agents and minimizes the number of steps.
  This work provides an algorithmic framework that allows constructing valid evacuation strategies for arbitrary input graphs. Specifically, we focus on the properties of the input graphs that lead to evacuation strategies with constant competitive ratios. In particular, we describe an application of the above framework that gives an asymptotically optimal evacuation for grids (and by extension hexagonal or triangular grids as well).</description>

      <title>Progress on Self Identifying Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of an identifying code for a graph was introduced by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty, and Levitin in 1998 as the problem of covering the vertices of a graph such that we can uniquely identify any vertex in the graph by examining the vertices that cover it. An application of an identifying code would be to detect a faulty processor in a multiprocessor system. In 2020, a variation of identify code called "self-identifying code" was introduced by Junnila and Laihonen, which simplifies the task of locating the malfunctioning processor. In this paper, we continue to explore self-identifying codes. In particular, we prove the problem of determining the minimum cardinality of a self-identifying code for an arbitrary graph is NP-complete and we investigate minimum-sized self-identifying code in several classes of graphs, including cubic graphs and infinite grids.</description>

      <title>Maker-Maker games of rank 4 are PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maker-Maker convention of positional games is played on a hypergraph whose edges are interpreted as winning sets. Two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex, aiming at being first to pick all the vertices of some edge. Optimal play can only lead to a first player win or a draw, and deciding between the two is known to be PSPACE-complete even for 6-uniform hypergraphs. We establish PSPACE-completeness for hypergraphs of rank 4. As an intermediary, we use the recently introduced achievement positional games, a more general convention in which each player has their own winning sets (blue and red). We show that deciding whether the blue player has a winning strategy as the first player is PSPACE-complete even with blue edges of size 2 or 3 and pairwise disjoint red edges of size 2. The result for hypergraphs of rank 4 in the Maker-Maker convention follows as a simple corollary.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Realization With Bounded Stretch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A periodic temporal graph, in its simplest form, is a graph in which every edge appears exactly once in the first $\Delta$ time steps, and then it reappears recurrently every $\Delta$ time steps, where $\Delta$ is a given period length. This model offers a natural abstraction of transportation networks where each transportation link connects two destinations periodically. From a network design perspective, a crucial task is to assign the time-labels on the edges in a way that optimizes some criterion. In this paper we introduce a very natural optimality criterion that captures how the temporal distances of all vertex pairs are `stretched', compared to their physical distances, i.e. their distances in the underlying static (non-temporal) graph. Given a static graph $G$, the task is to assign to each edge one time-label between 1 and $\Delta$ such that, in the resulting periodic temporal graph with period~$\Delta$, the duration of the fastest temporal path from any vertex $u$ to any other vertex $v$ is at most $\alpha$ times the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. Here, the value of $\alpha$ measures how much the shortest paths are allowed to be \emph{stretched} once we assign the periodic time-labels.
  Our results span three different directions: First, we provide a series of approximation and NP-hardness results. Second, we provide approximation and fixed-parameter algorithms. Among them, we provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm (the \textit{radius-algorithm}) which always guarantees an approximation strictly smaller than $\Delta$, and which also computes the optimum stretch in some cases. Third, we consider a parameterized local search extension of the problem where we are given the temporal labeling of the graph, but we are allowed to change the time-labels of at most $k$ edges; for this problem we prove that it is W[2]-hard but admits an XP algorithm with respect to $k$.</description>

      <title>Density Measures for Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent successes of large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of theoretical research into language generation. A recent line of work proposes an abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is seen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates strings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of candidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the algorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This formalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the algorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should be able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central in applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between hallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating only a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has been challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this trade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms for language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero density in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem unavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide an algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly positive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by these algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages they consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may require oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations. Our analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of convergence and limit points playing a key role.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings \((a, b, c)\), there exists a string \(z\) such that each of the values of conditional Kolmogorov complexity \(C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)\) is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We provide a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple \((a, b, c)\) for which no such string \(z\) exists. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on recent bounds on point-line incidences over prime fields. As an application, we show that this impossibility implies lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in the information-theoretic behavior of projective planes over fields with and without proper subfields.</description>

      <title>How Local Separators Shape Community Structure in Large Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a key tool for analyzing the structure of large networks. Standard methods, such as modularity optimization, focus on identifying densely connected groups but often overlook natural local separations in the graph. In this paper, we investigate local separator methods, which decompose networks based on structural bottlenecks rather than global connectivity. We systematically compare them with well-established community detection algorithms on large real-world networks. Our results show that local 1-separators consistently identify the densest communities, outperforming modularity-based methods in this regard, while local 2-separators reveal hierarchical structures but may over-fragment small clusters. These findings are particularly strong for road networks, suggesting practical applications in transportation and infrastructure analysis. Our study highlights local separators as a scalable and interpretable alternative for network decomposition.</description>

      <title>Explicit Lossless Vertex Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first construction of explicit constant-degree lossless vertex expanders. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and sufficiently large $d$, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of $d$-regular graphs where every small set $S$ of vertices has $(1-\varepsilon)d|S|$ neighbors (which implies $(1-2\varepsilon)d|S|$ unique-neighbors). Our results also extend naturally to construct biregular bipartite graphs of any constant imbalance, where small sets on each side have strong expansion guarantees. The graphs we construct admit a free group action, and hence realize new families of quantum LDPC codes of Lin and M. Hsieh with a linear time decoding algorithm.
  Our construction is based on taking an appropriate product of a constant-sized lossless expander with a base graph constructed from Ramanujan Cayley cubical complexes.</description>

      <title>Sunflowers and Ramsey problems for restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremal problems on set systems with restricted intersections have been an important part of combinatorics in the last 70 year. In this paper, we study the following Ramsey version of these problems. Given a set $L\subseteq \{0,\dots,k-1\}$ and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element sets which does not contain a sunflower with $m$ petals whose kernel size is in $L$, how large a subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ can we find in which no pair has intersection size in $L$? We give matching upper and lower bounds, determining the dependence on $m$ for all $k$ and $L$. This problem also finds applications in quantum computing.
  As an application of our techniques, we also obtain a variant of F\"uredi's celebrated semilattice lemma, which is a key tool in the powerful delta-system method. We prove that one cannot remove the double-exponential dependency on the uniformity in F\"uredi's result, however, we provide an alternative with significantly better, single-exponential dependency on the parameters, which is still strong enough for most applications of the delta-system method.</description>

      <title>The EnvDesign Model: A Method to Solve the Environment Design Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, several people and organizations rely on cloud platforms. The reliability of cloud platforms depends heavily on the performance of their internal programs (agents). To better prevent regressions in cloud platforms, the design of pre-production testing environments (that test new agents, new hardwares, and other changes) must take into account the diversity of server/node properties (hardware model, virtual machine type, etc.) across the fleet and dynamically emphasize or de-emphasize the prevalence of certain node properties based on current testing priorities. This paper formulates this task as the ``environment design" problem and presents the EnvDesign model, a method that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to solve the environment design problem. The EnvDesign model was built on context and techniques that apply to combinatorial testing in general, so it can support combinatorial testing in other domains. An earlier version of this paper was peer-reviewed and published internally at Microsoft.</description>

      <title>Complexity of approximate conflict-free, linearly-ordered, and nonmonochromatic hypergraph colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction problems, we establish complexity classifications of three natural variants of hypergraph colourings: standard nonmonochromatic colourings, conflict-free colourings, and linearly-ordered colourings.
  Firstly, we show that finding an $\ell$-colouring of a $k$-colourable $r$-uniform hypergraph is NP-hard for all constant $2\leq k\leq \ell$ and $r\geq 3$. This provides a shorter proof of a celebrated result by Dinur et al. [FOCS'02/Combinatorica'05].
  Secondly, we show that finding an $\ell$-conflict-free colouring of an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits a $k$-conflict-free colouring is NP-hard for all constant $3\leq k\leq\ell$ and $r\geq 4$, except for $r=4$ and $k=2$ (and any $\ell$); this case is solvable in polynomial time. The case of $r=3$ is the standard nonmonochromatic colouring, and the case of $r=2$ is the notoriously difficult open problem of approximate graph colouring.
  Thirdly, we show that finding an $\ell$-linearly-ordered colouring of an $r$-uniform hypergraph that admits a $k$-linearly-ordered colouring is NP-hard for all constant $3\leq k\leq\ell$ and $r\geq 4$, thus improving on the results of Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'y [ICALP'22/ACM TocT'23].</description>

      <title>Ramsey expansions of metrically homogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.02612v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey expansions, the coherent extension property for partial isometries (EPPA), and the existence of a stationary independence relation for all classes of metrically homogeneous graphs from Cherlin's catalogue. We show that, with the exception of tree-like graphs, all metric spaces in the catalogue have precompact Ramsey expansions (or lifts) with the expansion property. With two exceptions we can also characterise the existence of a stationary independence relation and coherent EPPA.
  Our results are a contribution to Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes and can be seen as empirical evidence of the recent convergence in techniques employed to establish the Ramsey property, the expansion property, EPPA and the existence of a stationary independence relation. At the heart of our proof is a canonical way of completing edge-labelled graphs to metric spaces in Cherlin's classes. The existence of such a ``completion algorithm'' then allows us to apply several strong results in the areas that imply EPPA or the Ramsey property.
  The main results have numerous consequences for the automorphism groups of the Fraisse limits of the classes. As corollaries, we prove amenability, unique ergodicity, existence of universal minimal flows, ample generics, small index property, 21-Bergman property and Serre's property (FA).</description>

      <title>Three iterations of $(d-1)$-WL test distinguish non isometric clouds of $d$-dimensional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler--Lehman (WL) test is a fundamental iterative algorithm for checking isomorphism of graphs. It has also been observed that it underlies the design of several graph neural network architectures, whose capabilities and performance can be understood in terms of the expressive power of this test. Motivated by recent developments in machine learning applications to datasets involving three-dimensional objects, we study when the WL test is {\em complete} for clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs, i.e., when it can distinguish, up to isometry, any arbitrary such cloud. %arbitrary clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs. % How many dimensions of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test is enough to distinguish any two non-isometric point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, assuming that these point clouds are given as complete graphs labeled by distances between the points? This question is important for understanding, which architectures of graph neural networks are capable of fully exploiting the spacial structure of a point cloud.
  Our main result states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional WL test is complete for point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any $d\ge 2$, and that only three iterations of the test suffice. We also observe that the $d$-dimensional WL test only requires one iteration to achieve completeness.
  Our paper thus provides complete understanding of the 3-dimensional case: it was shown in previous works that 1-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we show that 2-WL is complete there. We also strengthen the lower bound for 1-WL by showing that it is unable to recognize planar point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, we show that 2-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^6$, leaving as an open question, whether it is complete in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d = 4,5$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Facility Location Optimization: A Novel Integer Programming Formulation and Approaches to Heuristic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We attack the 4-level facility location problem (4L-FLP), a critical component in supply chains. Foundational tasks here involve selecting markets, plants, warehouses, and distribution centers to maximize profits while considering related constraints. Based on a variation of the quadratic assignment problem, we propose a novel integer programming formula that significantly reduces the variables. Our model incorporates several realistic features, including transportation costs and upper bounds on facilities at each level. It accounts for one-time fixed costs associated with selecting each facility. To solve this complex problem, we develop and experimentally test two solution procedures: a multi-start greedy heuristic and a multi-start tabu search. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on the results to assess the reliability of proposed algorithms. This study contributes to improved solution methods for large-scale 4L-FLPs, providing a valuable tool for supply chain maturity.</description>

      <title>Triangulated spheres with holes in triangulated surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{S}_h$ denote a sphere with $h$ holes. Given a triangulation $G$ of a surface $\mathbb{M}$, we consider the question of when $G$ contains a spanning subgraph $H$ such that $H$ is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_h$. We give a new short proof of a theorem of Nevo and Tarabykin that every triangulation $G$ of the torus contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated cylinder. For arbitrary surfaces, we prove that every high facewidth triangulation of a surface with $h$ handles contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{2h}$. We also prove that for every $0 \leq g' &lt; g$ and $w \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a triangulation of facewidth at least $w$ of a surface of Euler genus $g$ that does not have a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{g'}$. Our results are motivated by, and have applications for, rigidity questions in the plane.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform of Generalized $q$-ary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Fourier transform of a $q$-ary function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which maps $q$-ary sequences to real numbers, is an important problem in mathematics with wide-ranging applications in biology, signal processing, and machine learning. Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each $\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow \infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the transform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of $O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized $q$-ary functions $8\times$ faster using $16\times$ fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to $13\times$ fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as $q$-ary functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words as those words having a Burrows-Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>
