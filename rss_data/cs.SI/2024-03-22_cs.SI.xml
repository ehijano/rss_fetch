      <title>Graph Neural Network for Crawling Target Nodes in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks crawling is in the focus of active research the last years. One of the challenging task is to collect target nodes in an initially unknown graph given a budget of crawling steps. Predicting a node property based on its partially known neighbourhood is at the heart of a successful crawler. In this paper we adopt graph neural networks for this purpose and show they are competitive to traditional classifiers and are better for individual cases. Additionally we suggest a training sample boosting technique, which helps to diversify the training set at early stages of crawling and thus improves the predictor quality. The experimental study on three types of target set topology indicates GNN based approach has a potential in crawling task, especially in the case of distributed target nodes.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of information bubbles on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper to introduce a new model of evolvement of narratives (common opinions, information bubble) on networks. Our main tools come from invariant mean theory and graph theory. The case, when the root set of the network (influencers, news agencies, etc.) is ergodic is fully discussed. The other possibility, when the root contains more than one component is partially discussed and it could be a motivation for further research.</description>

      <title>PureConnect: A Localized Social Media System to Increase Awareness and Connectedness in Environmental Justice Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequent disruptions like highway constructions are common now-a-days, often impacting environmental justice communities (communities with low socio-economic status with disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects) that live nearby. Based on our interactions via focus groups with the members of four environmental justice communities impacted by a major highway construction, a common concern is a sense of uncertainty about project activities and loss of social connectedness, leading to increased stress, depression, anxiety and diminished well-being. This paper addresses this concern by developing a localized social media system called PureConnect with a goal to raise the level of awareness about the project and increase social connectedness among the community members. PureConnect has been designed using active engagement with four environmental justice communities affected by a major highway construction. It has been deployed in the real world among the members of the four environmental justice communities, and a detailed analysis of the data collected from this deployment as well as surveys show that PureConnect is potentially useful in improving community members' well-being and the members appreciate the functionalities it provides.</description>

      <title>From Perils to Possibilities: Understanding how Human (and AI) Biases affect Online Fora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms are online fora where users engage in discussions, share content, and build connections. This review explores the dynamics of social interactions, user-generated contents, and biases within the context of social media analysis (analyzing works that use the tools offered by complex network analysis and natural language processing) through the lens of three key points of view: online debates, online support, and human-AI interactions. On the one hand, we delineate the phenomenon of online debates, where polarization, misinformation, and echo chamber formation often proliferate, driven by algorithmic biases and extreme mechanisms of homophily. On the other hand, we explore the emergence of online support groups through users' self-disclosure and social support mechanisms. Online debates and support mechanisms present a duality of both perils and possibilities within social media; perils of segregated communities and polarized debates, and possibilities of empathy narratives and self-help groups. This dichotomy also extends to a third perspective: users' reliance on AI-generated content, such as the ones produced by Large Language Models, which can manifest both human biases hidden in training sets and non-human biases that emerge from their artificial neural architectures. Analyzing interdisciplinary approaches, we aim to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between social interactions, user-generated content, and biases within the realm of social media ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Collecting Influencers: A Comparative Study of Online Network Crawlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online network crawling tasks require a lot of efforts for the researchers to collect the data. One of them is identification of important nodes, which has many applications starting from viral marketing to the prevention of disease spread. Various crawling algorithms has been suggested but their efficiency is not studied well. In this paper we compared six known crawlers on the task of collecting the fraction of the most influential nodes of graph.
  We analyzed crawlers behavior for four measures of node influence: node degree, k-coreness, betweenness centrality, and eccentricity. The experiments confirmed that greedy methods perform the best in many settings, but the cases exist when they are very inefficient.</description>

      <title>Random Graph Modeling: A survey of the concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random graph (RG) models play a central role in the complex networks analysis. They help to understand, control, and predict phenomena occurring, for instance, in social networks, biological networks, the Internet, etc.
  Despite a large number of RG models presented in the literature, there are few concepts underlying them. Instead of trying to classify a wide variety of very dispersed models, we capture and describe concepts they exploit considering preferential attachment, copying principle, hyperbolic geometry, recursively defined structure, edge switching, Monte Carlo sampling, etc. We analyze RG models, extract their basic principles, and build a taxonomy of concepts they are based on. We also discuss how these concepts are combined in RG models and how they work in typical applications like benchmarks, null models, and data anonymization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as "dynamical importance", which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>

      <title>Whose Side Are You On? Investigating the Political Stance of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity for their application in various everyday tasks such as text generation, summarization, and information retrieval. As the widespread adoption of LLMs continues to surge, it becomes increasingly crucial to ensure that these models yield responses that are politically impartial, with the aim of preventing information bubbles, upholding fairness in representation, and mitigating confirmation bias. In this paper, we propose a quantitative framework and pipeline designed to systematically investigate the political orientation of LLMs. Our investigation delves into the political alignment of LLMs across a spectrum of eight polarizing topics, spanning from abortion to LGBTQ issues. Across topics, the results indicate that LLMs exhibit a tendency to provide responses that closely align with liberal or left-leaning perspectives rather than conservative or right-leaning ones when user queries include details pertaining to occupation, race, or political affiliation. The findings presented in this study not only reaffirm earlier observations regarding the left-leaning characteristics of LLMs but also surface particular attributes, such as occupation, that are particularly susceptible to such inclinations even when directly steered towards conservatism. As a recommendation to avoid these models providing politicised responses, users should be mindful when crafting queries, and exercise caution in selecting neutral prompt language.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Graph Representation Learning for Tactical Networks Future State Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resource allocation in tactical ad-hoc networks presents unique challenges due to their dynamic and multi-hop nature. Accurate prediction of future network connectivity is essential for effective resource allocation in such environments. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Graph Encoder-Decoder (STGED) framework for Tactical Communication Networks that leverages both spatial and temporal features of network states to learn latent tactical behaviors effectively. STGED hierarchically utilizes graph-based attention mechanism to spatially encode a series of communication network states, leverages a recurrent neural network to temporally encode the evolution of states, and a fully-connected feed-forward network to decode the connectivity in the future state. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that STGED consistently outperforms baseline models by large margins across different time-steps input, achieving an accuracy of up to 99.2\% for the future state prediction task of tactical communication networks.</description>

      <title>Language Models Can Reduce Asymmetry in Information Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the buyer's inspection paradox for information markets. The paradox is that buyers need to access information to determine its value, while sellers need to limit access to prevent theft. To study this, we introduce an open-source simulated digital marketplace where intelligent agents, powered by language models, buy and sell information on behalf of external participants. The central mechanism enabling this marketplace is the agents' dual capabilities: they not only have the capacity to assess the quality of privileged information but also come equipped with the ability to forget. This ability to induce amnesia allows vendors to grant temporary access to proprietary information, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized retention while enabling agents to accurately gauge the information's relevance to specific queries or tasks. To perform well, agents must make rational decisions, strategically explore the marketplace through generated sub-queries, and synthesize answers from purchased information. Concretely, our experiments (a) uncover biases in language models leading to irrational behavior and evaluate techniques to mitigate these biases, (b) investigate how price affects demand in the context of informational goods, and (c) show that inspection and higher budgets both lead to higher quality outcomes.</description>

      <title>Moral Judgments in Narratives on Reddit: Investigating Moral Sparks via Social Commonsense and Linguistic Signals</title>

Abstract: Machine ethics ensures ethical conduct in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and agents. Examining real-life applications benefit learning practical ethics in many situations, offering valuable data to grasp the complexities of human ethics in diverse contexts. In this paper, we examine social media platforms for understanding real-life ethical scenarios and human moral judgments. We examine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called r/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on who is blameworthy. We employ computational techniques to investigate the underlying reasoning influencing moral judgments. We focus on excerpts-which we term moral sparks-from original posts that commenters include to indicate what motivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating social commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect moral sparks assignment and their subsequent judgments. By examining over 24 672 posts and 175988 comments, we find that event-related negative character traits (e.g., immature and rude) attract attention and stimulate blame, implying a dependent relationship between character traits and moral values. Specially, we focus on causal graph involving events (c-events) that activate social commonsense. We observe that c-events are perceived with varying levels of informativeness, influencing moral spark and judgment assignment in distinct ways. This observation is reinforced by examining linguistic features describing semantically similar c-events. Moreover, language influencing commenters' cognitive processes enhances the probability of an excerpt becoming a moral spark, while factual and concrete descriptions tend to inhibit this effect.</description>

      <title>Hub-aware Random Walk Graph Embedding Methods for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last two decades we are witnessing a huge increase of valuable big data structured in the form of graphs or networks. To apply traditional machine learning and data analytic techniques to such data it is necessary to transform graphs into vector-based representations that preserve the most essential structural properties of graphs. For this purpose, a large number of graph embedding methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them produce general-purpose embeddings suitable for a variety of applications such as node clustering, node classification, graph visualisation and link prediction. In this paper, we propose two novel graph embedding algorithms based on random walks that are specifically designed for the node classification problem. Random walk sampling strategies of the proposed algorithms have been designed to pay special attention to hubs -- high-degree nodes that have the most critical role for the overall connectedness in large-scale graphs. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated by analyzing the classification performance of three classification algorithms trained on embeddings of real-world networks. The obtained results indicate that our methods considerably improve the predictive power of examined classifiers compared to currently the most popular random walk method for generating general-purpose graph embeddings (node2vec).</description>

      <title>Can Generative AI Generate Breakthrough Ideas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge in generative AI capabilities has affected sectors such as drug discovery and creative text generation, fueling widespread enthusiasm about its potential to revolutionize scientific discovery through efficient exploration of knowledge combinations. But is this belief well-founded? This belief is rooted in the recombinant growth theory, which posits that innovation accelerates when existing ideas are iteratively combined. However, the theory encounters two significant challenges in understanding the nature of breakthroughs. First, breakthroughs such as relativity replacing Newtonian physics drive progress through competition, because they are fundamentally substitutive of older ones. Second, the recombinant strategy often only generates different ideas rather than better ones. Building on these, our study indicates the limitation of combinatorial view of innovation and point to the role of idea competition rather than combination in advancing science, even in the age of AI. Our results suggest that breakthroughs occur when ideas compete, not when they combine, and that combining more ideas tends to result in smaller innovations. This challenges the combinatoric metaphor of innovation that has captivated academia for three decades and complements subsequent studies equating content novelty with transformative innovation. Policymakers and researchers should focus on fostering environments that encourage idea competition and the development of AI systems capable of generating novel, disruptive ideas.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent-based inference for dynamic network models with attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Coevolving Latent Space Networks with Attractors (CLSNA) models, nodes in a latent space represent social actors, and edges indicate their dynamic interactions. Attractors are added at the latent level to capture the notion of attractive and repulsive forces between nodes, borrowing from dynamical systems theory. However, CLSNA reliance on MCMC estimation makes scaling difficult, and the requirement for nodes to be present throughout the study period limit practical applications. We address these issues by (i) introducing a Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) parameter estimation method, (ii) developing a novel approach for uncertainty quantification using SGD, and (iii) extending the model to allow nodes to join and leave over time. Simulation results show that our extensions result in little loss of accuracy compared to MCMC, but can scale to much larger networks. We apply our approach to the longitudinal social networks of members of US Congress on the social media platform X. Accounting for node dynamics overcomes selection bias in the network and uncovers uniquely and increasingly repulsive forces within the Republican Party.</description>
