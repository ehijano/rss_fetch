      <title>A broadband solid impedance transformer for acoustic transmission between water and air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total acoustic transmission between air and water was shown in our recent paper to be attainable with a solid interface comprising two parallel thin elastic plates connected by rigid ribs, although the transmissivity is a narrow-band effect. We demonstrate here that broadband transmission can be obtained by introducing a third, central plate. A theoretical analysis combined with numerical optimization shows that the optimal 3-plate impedance transformer has a central plate far thicker than the others. This implies a simpler interpretation of the optimal 3-plate impedance transformer as two elastic plates separated by a mass-like impedance. The characteristics of the broadband transformer may then be understood using results for the previously studied 2-plate system and asymptotic approximations using the small air-to-water impedance ratio. Optimal systems with water and air-side plates of similar material have relative thicknesses of approximately three to one, respectively, with the central mass having areal density approximately 17 times the water side plate. Further identities relate the frequency of total transmission to the plate thicknesses and to the rib separation length. The impedance transformer is compared to an ideal two layer quarter wavelength model, allowing us to identify a minimal attainable Q-factor of about 5.5, which is achieved in examples presented. The formulas for approximately optimized parameters also serve as the initial population for numerical optimization, greatly accelerating the process. Together, the theoretical and numerical results point to a remarkably simple class of purely solid impedance transformers, with system parameters well defined by the asymptotically small parameter: the ratio of air-to-water acoustic impedances.</description>

      <title>Passive Reactance Compensation for Shape-Reconfigurable Wireless Power Transfer Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powering range of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is typically confined to areas close to the transmitter. Shape-reconfigurable two-dimensional (2-D) relay resonator arrays have been developed to extend this range, offering greater deployment flexibility. However, these arrays encounter challenges due to cross-coupling among adjacent resonators, which detune system impedance and create power dead zones. This issue often necessitates active components such as receiver position tracking, increasing system overhead. This study introduces a passive reactance compensation mechanism that counteracts detuning effects, enabling the simultaneous activation of all resonators at a fixed operating frequency, regardless of the array's shape, thus providing a consistent charging area. The key innovation involves mechanically appending reactance elements to neutralize detuning caused by inductive coupling, facilitating hassle-free resonator reconfiguration without requiring prior knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate the elimination of dead zones with multiple configurations, boosting the minimum power transfer efficiency from 3.0% to 56.8%.</description>

      <title>Chemically resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy by longitudinal magnetization detection with a diamond magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-inductive magnetometers based on solid-state spins offer a promising solution for small-volume nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection. A remaining challenge is to operate at a sufficiently high magnetic field to resolve chemical shifts at the part-per-billion level. Here, we demonstrate a Ramsey-M_z protocol that uses Ramsey interferometry to convert an analyte's transverse spin precession into a longitudinal magnetization (M_z), which is subsequently modulated and detected with a diamond magnetometer. We record NMR spectra at B0=0.32 T with a fractional spectral resolution of ~350 ppb, limited by the stability of the electromagnet bias field. We perform NMR spectroscopy on a ~1 nL detection volume of ethanol and resolve the chemical shift structure with negligible distortion. Through simulation, we show that the protocol can be extended to fields up to B0=3 T, with minimal spectral distortion, using composite nuclear-spin inversion pulses. For sub-nanoliter analyte volumes, we estimate a resolution of ~1 ppb and concentration sensitivity of ~40 mM s^{1/2} is feasible with improvements to the sensor design. Our results establish diamond magnetometers as high-resolution NMR detectors in the moderate magnetic field regime, with potential applications in metabolomics and pharmaceutical research.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast one-chip optical receiver with functional metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed optical receivers are crucial in modern optical communication systems. While complex photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are widely employed to harness the full degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light for efficient data transmission, their waveguide nature inherently constrains two-dimensional spatial scaling to accommodate a large number of optical signals in parallel. Here, we present a novel optical receiver platform that fully exploits the high spatial parallelism and ultrabroad bandwidth of light, while leveraging all DOFs - intensity, phase, and polarization. Our solution integrates a thin metasurface, composed of silicon nanoposts, with ultrafast membrane photodetectors on a compact chip. The metasurface provides all the functionalities of conventional PICs for normal-incident spatially parallelized light, enabling high-speed detection of optical signals in various modulation formats, including simultaneous detection of 320-gigabits-per-second four-channel signals and coherent detection of a 240-gigabits-per-second signal.</description>

      <title>Integrated microring resonator and waveguide polarizers based on partially photo-reduced 2D graphene oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical polarizers, which selectively transmit light with specific polarization states, are essential components in modern optical systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate integrated waveguide and microring resonator (MRR) polarizers incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO). 2D graphene oxide (GO) films are integrated onto silicon photonic devices with precise control over their thicknesses and sizes, followed by GO reduction via two different methods including uniform thermal reduction and localized photothermal reduction. We measure devices with different lengths, thicknesses, and reduction degrees of the GO films. The results show that the devices with rGO exhibit better performance than those with GO, achieving a polarization-dependent loss of ~47 dB and a polarization extinction ratio of ~16 dB for the hybrid waveguides and MRRs with rGO, respectively. By fitting the experimental results with theory, it is found that rGO exhibits more significant anisotropy in loss, with an anisotropy ratio over 4 times that of GO. In addition, rGO shows higher thermal stability and greater robustness to photothermal reduction than GO. These results highlight the strong potential of rGO films for implementing high-performance polarization selective devices in integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Hybrid confinement techniques for polariton simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons in III-V semiconductor microcavities offer a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling advancements in photonic applications and quantum simulation. Here, two novel fabrication techniques designed to overcome the limitations of traditional photonic confinement methods are introduced. The two distinct approaches - etch-and-oversputter (EnS) and deposit-and-oversputter (DnS) - are both based on a structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavity, leading to a deep and highly controllable spatially dependent potential. By utilizing an all-dielectric sputtered top mirror, sample iteration time, workflow complexity and expense is reduced while increasing the overall yield compared to methods such as deep ion etching. Employing a Kagome lattice and its flatband and Dirac-cone dispersions as a benchmark, high quality optical band structures are achieved, which so far have not been realized using a deep etching approach. To highlight the precise control over the lattice couplings, the eigenmodes in a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice are studied and polariton lasing from a zerodimensional corner mode is observed. This confirms the effectiveness of the methods presented in this paper for generating well-controlled, deep and homogeneous trapping potentials. These pave the way for fabricating intricate lattices, such as higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum emitters utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hermite-Gaussian multi-mode excitation in spatial gain shaping approaches for laser resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the excitation of transverse laser modes through spatial gain shaping, while focusing on the boundary between selective single-mode and multi-mode lasing. By deliberately reducing the similarity between intensity distributions of pump and laser mode, it was studied, if and which other modes are excited besides the target mode, and how the modes compete for the spatially distributed gain. Analysis of the usually unwanted multi-mode lasing revealed characteristic properties of pump distributions adapted to Hermite-Gaussian $\text{HG}_{m,0}$ modes: a center-heavy pump distribution at first distinctly excites the target mode and eventually low-order modes, whereas an eccentric pump distribution reduces the lasing threshold at the expense of distinction to the neighboring modes. By understanding why certain gain distributions do not excite a single mode, we infer guidelines for the design of pump patterns in spatial gain shaping approaches.</description>

      <title>Space compatibility of emerging, wide-bandgap, ultralow-loss integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonics has revolutionized optical communication, sensing, and computation, offering miniaturized and lightweight solutions for spacecraft with limited size and payload. Novel chip-scale instruments based on ultralow-loss integrated photonic platforms, including lasers, frequency combs and atomic traps, have been developed for space applications. Therefore, quantifying the space compatibility of ultralow-loss photonic integrated circuits (PICs), particularly their radiation resistance, is critical. This study experimentally evaluates the radiation resistance of ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$, 4H-SiC, and LiNbO$_3$ PICs under intense $\gamma$-ray and high-energy proton irradiation. Results show that proton irradiation with $1.1 \times 10^{10}$ $\mathrm{p/cm^2}$ total flux does not significantly increase optical loss or alter the refractive index of these PICs, while $\gamma$-ray irradiation with 1.2 Mrad accumulated dose only marginally increases their optical loss. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the excellent space compatibility of ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$, 4H-SiC, and LiNbO$_3$ PICs, highlighting their potential for compact and lightweight space systems.</description>

      <title>High-frequency magnetic response measurement of test mass with a fluxgate magnetometer for gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For space-borne gravitational wave detectors,such as LISA and TianQin ,the disturbance caused by the coupling of test masses and the external magnetic fields is one of the main sources of the residual acceleration noise. Although the detection frequency band is from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz, magnetic fields with frequencies higher than 1 Hz can still contribute to the noise through down conversion effect. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the AC magnetic susceptibility or magnetic response of the test mass at higher frequency for the evaluation of the magnetic noise. In this work, we propose a magnetic field response measurement method by directly probing the induced magnetic field of the test mass placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field. The frequency can be measured up to 1500 Hz, satisfying the requirement of space-borne gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Dual Optical Hyperbolicity of PdCoO$_2$ and PdCrO$_2$ Delafossite Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials exhibit a very peculiar optical anisotropy with simultaneously different signs of the dielectric tensor components. This anisotropy allows the propagation of exotic surface-wave excitations like hyperbolic phonons and plasmon polaritons. While hyperbolic materials hold promise for applications in subwavelength photonics and enhanced light-matter interactions, their natural occurrence is limited to few materials, often accompanied by significant dielectric losses and limited hyperbolic spectral bandwidth. Focusing on PdCoO$_2$ and PdCrO$_2$ delafossite transition-metal oxides, in this paper we demonstrate their unique dual hyperbolic regimes: one localized around a phonon absorption in the mid-infrared spectral region, and the other extending into the visible range. Both hyperbolic regimes show exceptional properties including low dissipation and high hyperbolic quality factors. These results pave the way for innovative applications of delafossite layered metals in subwavelength photonics, imaging, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Symmetrical bipolar electrobending deformation in acceptor-doped piezoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2022, large apparent strains (&gt;1%) with highly asymmetrical strain-electric field (S-E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric-field-induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, we report a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where convex bending always occurs along the pre-poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the defect dipoles in one surface layer during the pre-poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly-like symmetrical bipolar S-E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss Integration of High-Density Polymer Waveguides with Silicon Photonics for Co-Packaged Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-Packaged Optics applications require scalable and high-yield optical interfacing solutions to silicon photonic chiplets, offering low-loss, broadband, and polarization-independent optical coupling while maintaining compatibility with widely used approaches for electrical redistribution. We present two heterogeneous integration techniques that enable high-density electrical and optical I/O connections, utilizing adiabatic coupling between on-chip silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides and package-level polymer optical waveguides. In the first approach, polymer waveguides are patterned using standard lithography directly on the surface of the photonic chip, ensuring compatibility with chip embedding as commonly employed in chip-first fanout wafer-level packaging. In the second approach, photonic chips are flip-chip bonded to the package substrate. Both techniques have been experimentally validated, achieving a coupling efficiency near 1 dB between SiN and polymer waveguides in O-band, for both TE and TM polarizations. SiN tapers were designed using the "Mono" method to optimize phase-matching conditions between the two waveguides, a critical requirement for integrating diverse optical components. These results demonstrate the potential of polymer waveguides in Co-Packaged Optics applications, achieving sub-2 dB chip-to-chip and chip-to-fiber coupling losses.</description>

Abstract: The occurrence of radio-frequency (rf) breakdown limits operational electromagnetic gradients in accelerator structures. Experimental evidence often suggests that breakdown events are associated with temperature and dark current spikes on the surface of rf devices. In the past decade, there has been increased interest in unveiling the mechanism behind breakdown initiation in metal copper and copper alloys. However, effort regarding breakdown phenomenon in photocathode relevant semiconductors have been more limited. In this work, we explore field-emission-assisted heating via Nottingham and Joule processes, as a possible candidate for breakdown initiation. For this, field emission from intrinsic Cs2Te ultra-thin film coated on a copper substrate was modeled within the Stratton/Baskin/Lvov/Fursey (SBLF) formalism, describing the processes and effects in the bulk and on the surface of a photocathode exposed to high radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. It is shown that field emission characteristic deviates significantly from the classical Fowler-Nordheim (FN) theory, whereby predicting that dark current is orders of magnitude lower than one expected by FN law. Conventional pulsed heating was also found to impose negligible heating to the photo-cathode. Both conclusions suggest that Cs2Te photocathode coated on a metal substrate would be insensitive to catastrophic thermal-material runaway breakdown, unlike what is observed for metal surfaces. Finally, a few unconventional breakdown candidate scenarios are identified and discussed including thermo-elastic deformation and avalanche breakdown.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of phase change accommodating hydrogen uptake in bimetallic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06752</link>

Abstract: Hydrogen holds great promise as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, but its efficient and affordable storage remains a significant challenge. Bimetallic systems, such as Pd-Ni, present a promising option for storing hydrogen. In this study, using the combination of different cuttingedge X-ray and electron techniques, we observed the transformations of Pd-Ni nanoparticles, which initially consist of a NiO-rich shell surrounding a Pd-rich core but undergo a major transformation when interacting with hydrogen. During the hydrogen exposure, the Pd core breaks into smaller pockets, dramatically increasing its surface area and enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity, especially in nanoparticles with lower Pd content. The findings provide deep understanding of the morphological changes at the atomic level during hydrogen storage and contribute for designing cost-effective hydrogen storage using multi-metallic systems.</description>
