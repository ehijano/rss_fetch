      <title>Full Inverse Compton Scattering: Total Transfer of Energy and Momentum from Electrons to Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss a peculiar regime of Compton Scattering that assures the maximum transfer of energy and momentum from free electrons propagating in vacuum to the scattered photons. We name this regime Full Inverse Compton Scattering (FICS) because it is characterized by the maximum and full energy loss of the electrons in collision with photons: up to 100 % of the electron kinetic energy is indeed transferred to the photon. In the case of relativistic electrons, characterized by a large Lorentz factor (gamma &gt;&gt; 1), FICS regime corresponds to an incident photon energy equal to mec^2/2 . We interpret such an astonishing result as FICS being the time reversal of direct Compton Scattering of very energetic photons (of energy much greater than mec2) onto atomic electrons. Although the cross section of Compton scattering is decreasing with the energy of the incident photon, making the process less probable with respect to other reactions (pair production, nuclear reactions, etc) when high energetic photons are bombarding a target, the kinematics straightforwardly implies that the back-scattered photons would have an energy reaching asymptotically me^2c^2 . FICS is instead the unique suitable working point in Compton scattering for achieving the total transfer of (kinetic) energy exactly from the electron to the photon. Experiencing transitions from the initial momentum to zero in the laboratory system, in FICS the electron is also subject to very large negative acceleration; this fact can lead to possible experiments of sensing the Unruh temperature and related photon bath. On the other side of the energy dynamic range, low relativistic electrons can be completely stopped by moderate energy photons (tens of keV), leading to full exchange of temperature between electron clouds and photon baths.</description>

      <title>Ancilla mediated higher entanglement as T-duality, a categorial conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a higher categorial interpretation of entanglement involving gauge theories and $\sigma$-models instead of qubits, one recovers T-duality as a form of ancilla aided entanglement generation. This opens the way towards new dualities in gauge theories and $\sigma$-models produced by means of analogies with quantum circuits of various types.</description>

      <title>The post-Newtonian metric of a self-gravitating and collapsing thin spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the metric for a self-gravitating and collapsing infinitely-thin spherical shell under the theory of post-Newtonian approximation, and successfully recover the shell's energy-momentum tensor from the achieved metric. The post-Newtonian dynamic equations of the test particles inside and outside the shell are achieved respectively. It is demonstrated that the radial motion of the spherically-symmetric system can contribute to the second gravitational potential and the gravitomagnetic field, inducing the time-dependent gravitational effects.</description>
