      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <title>Electronic reconstruction and interface engineering of emergent spin fluctuations in compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ on SrLaAlO$_4$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</description>

      <title>Charting the landscape of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors in experimentally known compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a high-throughput computational search for novel phonon-mediated superconductors, starting from the Materials Cloud 3-dimensional structure database of experimentally known inorganic stoichiometric compounds. We first compute the Allen-Dynes critical temperature (T$_c$) for 4533 non-magnetic metals using a direct and progressively finer sampling of the electron-phonon couplings. For the candidates with the largest T$_c$, we use automated Wannierizations and electron-phonon interpolations to obtain a high-quality dataset for the most promising 240 dynamically stable structures, for which we calculate spectral functions, superconducting bandgaps, and isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg critical temperatures. For 110 of these, we also provide anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting gaps and critical temperatures. The approach is remarkably successful in finding known superconductors, and we find 24 unknown ones with a predicted anisotropic Tc above 10 K. Among them, we identify a possible double gap superconductor (p-doped BaB$_2$), a non-magnetic half-Heusler ZrRuSb, and the perovskite TaRu$_3$C, all exhibiting significant T$_c$. Finally, we introduce a sensitivity analysis to estimate the robustness of the predictions.</description>

      <title>A controllable theory of superconductivity due to strong repulsion in a polarized band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interaction be shown to give rise to pairing in a controllable way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction overlap is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. We illustrate our method with a two-band model that is often used to describe multi-layer rhombohedral graphene and comment on the relationship with experiments. This work opens a reliable pathway to search for topological superconductors with high-$T_c$ (relative to $\epsilon_F$) in materials with strongly interactions. We summarize the requirements and suggest some illustrative design structures.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Majorana wave packets at surfaces of nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors can host zero-energy flat bands of Majorana surface states within the projection of the nodal lines onto the surface Brillouin zone. Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.</description>

      <title>Stacked Josephson junctions for quantum circuit applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-loss inductors are essential components in various superconducting circuits, such as qubits or digital electronics. In this study, we investigate highly compact inductors formed by vertical stacking of Josephson junctions. Our implementation employs multiple layers of aluminum separated by tunnel barriers. Individual stacks are connected by suspended superconducting bridges, which are free of additional dielectric materials and therefore should not contribute significantly to losses. We present implementation details, fabrication results, and device characterization measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance and non-trivial properties of superconductor normal metal interfaces was discovered by Alexander Fyodorovich Andreev more than 60 years ago. Only much later these hybrids have found wide interest in applications such as thermometry and refrigeration, electrical metrology, and quantum circuit engineering. Here we discuss the central properties of such interfaces and describe some of the most prominent and recent applications of them.</description>

      <title>Complex Magnetic Ordering in Candidate Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for chiral topological superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator (TI)-FeTe heterostructures is a key frontier in condensed matter physics, with potential applications in topological quantum computing. The combination of ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topologically nontrivial surface states brings together the key elements required for chiral Majorana physics. In this work, we examine the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity at the interfaces between FeTe and a series of TI overlayers. In superconducting MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/FeTe, any interfacial suppression of antiferromagnetism must affect at most a few nanometers. On the other hand, (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$/FeTe layers exhibit near-total suppression of antiferromagnetic ordering. Ferromagnetic Cr$_x$(Bi,Sb)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ (CBST)/FeTe bilayers exhibit net magnetization in both CBST and FeTe layers, with evidence of interactions between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. These observations identify magnetic TI/FeTe interfaces as an exceptionally robust platform to realize chiral topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Finding Hidden Numbers with Majorana-based Topological Quantum Algorithms: Simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms using Majorana zero modes - a major milestone for the field of topological quantum computing - requires a platform that can be scaled to large quantum registers, can be controlled in real time and space, and a braiding protocol that uses the unique properties of these exotic particles. Here, we demonstrate the first successful simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures from initialization to read-out of the final many-body state. Utilizing the Majorana zero modes' topological properties, we introduce an optimized braiding protocol for the algorithm and a scalable architecture for its implementation with an arbitrary number of qubits. We visualize the algorithm protocol in real time and space by computing the non-equilibrium density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance, and the non-equilibrium charge density, which assigns a unique signature to each final state of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraneous high frequency chip modes parasitic to superconducting quantum circuits can result in decoherence when these modes are excited. To suppress these modes, superconducting air bridges (AB) are commonly used to electrically connect ground planes together when interrupted by transmission lines. Here, we demonstrate the use of two-photon photolithography to build a supporting 3D resist structure in conjunction with a lift-off process to create AB. The resulting aluminum AB, have a superconducting transition temperature $T_{c} = 1.08$ K and exhibit good mechanical strength up to lengths of 100 $\mu$m. A measurable amount of microwave loss is observed when 35 AB were placed over a high-$Q$ Ta quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonator.</description>

      <title>New insight on the phase diagram of the superconducting iron spin ladder BaFe$_2$S$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ are the only two quasi-one-dimensional iron-based compounds that become superconductors under pressure. Interestingly, these two compounds exhibit different symmetries and properties. While more detailed and recent studies on BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ using single crystals have advanced the filed towards a more universal description of this family, such a study is still lacking for the compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$. Here, we present a detailed study of the crystalline and magnetic structure performed on single crystals using X-ray and neutron diffraction. We demonstrate a polar structure at room temperature within the $Cm2m$ space group, followed by a structural transition at 130 K to the polar $Pb2_1m$ space group. This space group remains unchanged across the magnetic transition at $T_N =95$ K, revealing multiferroic characteristics with a weak magnetoelastic coupling. The determined magnetic structure is monoclinic ($P_am$), with non-collinear magnetic moments, displaying a significant angle of 18$^\circ$ relative to the $a$-axis in the $(a, c)$ plane. This reexamination of the temperature-dependent properties of BaFe$_2$S$_3$ provides new insights into the physics of this system from multiple key perspectives.</description>

      <title>Charge Parity Rates in Transmon Qubits with Different Shunting Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting resonators and qubits operating at millikelvin temperature has been known for decades. One metric for the number of quasiparticles affecting qubits is the rate of single-electron change in charge on the qubit island ($\textit i.e.$ the charge parity rate). Here, we have utilized a Ramsey-like pulse sequence to monitor changes in the parity states of five transmon qubits. The five qubits have shunting capacitors with two different geometries and fabricated from both Al and Ta. The charge parity rate differs by a factor of two for the two transmon designs studied here but does not depend on the material of the shunting capacitor. The underlying mechanism of the source of parity switching is further investigated in one of the qubit devices by increasing the quasiparticle trapping rate using induced vortices in the electrodes of the device. The charge parity rate exhibited a weak dependence on the quasiparticle trapping rate, indicating that the main source of charge parity events is from the production of quasiparticles across the Josephson junction. To estimate this source of quasiparticle production, we simulate and estimate pair-breaking photon absorption rates for our two qubit geometries and find a similar factor of two in the absorption rate for a background blackbody radiation temperature of $T^*\sim$ 350 mK.</description>

Despite extensive research, the interplay between oxygen stoichiometry and electronic properties in infinite layer nickelates remains inadequately understood. In this study, we employ advanced electron microscopy techniques and theoretical modeling to directly visualize the distribution of residual oxygen within an 8NdNiO$_2$/2SrTiO$_3$ superlattice, providing novel insights into its structural and electronic effects. Our multislice ptychography analysis reveals a disordered arrangement of apical oxygen atoms, even in regions with low residual oxygen occupancy, invisible in conventional projected images but discernible in depth-resolved phase contrast images. This disordered distribution suggests the formation of local domains with varying degrees of oxygenation, leading to significant structural distortions. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals inhomogeneous hole doping, which may influence the occurrence of superconductivity. Complementary density functional theory calculations show how residual oxygen and associated structural distortions, such as pyramidal and octahedral configurations, alter the electronic structure. Although superconductivity was not observed in the studied superlattice, our findings highlight the critical influence of residual oxygen in shaping electronic phases and suggest that precise control of oxygen stoichiometry is essential in infinite layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetic ripples in the UTe2 high magnetic field phase diagram</title>

Abstract: The heavy fermion metamagnet uranium ditelluride possesses two distinct magnetic field--induced superconducting states. One of these superconductive phases resides at magnetic fields immediately below a first-order metamagnetic transition to a field--polarized paramagnetic state at a field strength $H_m$, while the other exists predominantly above $H_m$. However, little is known about the microscopic properties of this polarized paramagnetic state. Here we report pulsed magnetic field measurements tracking the evolution of $H_m$ for polar and azimuthal inclinations in the vicinity of the crystallographic $b-a$ plane. We uncover a region of the phase diagram at high fields $&gt;$ 50 T with a ripple-like non-monotonic dependence of $H_m$ on the orientation of field. Within this ripple in the metamagnetic transition surface, $H_m$ exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence. Our results point towards the presence of complex magnetic interactions and possible magnetic sub-phases at high magnetic fields in UTe$_2$, which may have important implications for the manifestation of exotic field-induced superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide new insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>A quantum critical line bounds the high field metamagnetic transition surface in UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum critical phenomena are widely studied across various materials families, from high temperature superconductors to magnetic insulators. They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability - a so-called quantum critical point - at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum fluctuations. Here we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe$_2$ possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three Cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the three-dimensional transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality - a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits a magnetic field-induced superconducting state in a toroidal shape, which persists to fields over 70~T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion, and show how a three-dimensional quantum critical phase boundary - rather than a more conventional singular point of instability - anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear diode effect and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in purely two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase diagrams and electronic transport properties of the helical states in purely two-dimensional (2D) Rashba superconductors coupled with in-plane Zeeman fields are studied. The continuum XY action is derived microscopically by integrating out the Gaussian amplitude fluctuation from the effective action. We show that the superfluid stiffness obtained from this procedure is exactly equivalent to the second-order derivative of the mean-field free energy density with respect to Cooper pair momentum, indicating an essential role of the amplitude fluctuation. The vortex core energy is also included in this work, and its effects on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition line are discussed. The theory of nonlinear V-I characteristics in purely 2D superconductors is also revised to incorporate recent developments in the theory of the superconducting diode effect. The main results are as follows. We find that the nonlinear V-I characteristics of the system become nonreciprocal in finite in-plane Zeeman fields. This is reminiscent of the superconducting diode effect in 2D systems, although the critical current is zero in purely 2D superconductors. Furthermore, we find that the bare effective superfluid stiffness along the BKT transition line has a local minimum at a certain temperature, and the nonreciprocity of the V-I characteristics is strongly enhanced around this temperature.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$ (YBCO), where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a \textit{local} superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We show how this scenario can fit most of the available data. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. While the bulk of this paper addresses the experiment on YBCO, this work reveals a new instability in the sine-Gordon equation that is of fundamental interest, with potential applications such as providing a mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales in Josephson devices.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of superconductivity in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting order parameter in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. In the absence of superconductivity, its ground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK interaction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but leaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out the non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which contains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude vanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also investigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase transition, and find that its non-analytic temporal behaviour is close but does not match exactly the vanishing of the order parameter. The momentum space entanglement entropy between positive and negative momentum modes, relevant for Cooper pairing, is calculated. Counterintuitively, this momentum space entanglement does not change significantly during the quench dynamics and its value remains reasonably large even for vanishing superconducting order parameter. Nevertheless, its derivative with respect to the HK interaction signals the dynamical phase transition associated to the late time vanishing of superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light driving. The transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</description>
