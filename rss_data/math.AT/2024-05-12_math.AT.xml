      <title>Maps between spherical group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for finitely generated abelian groups $A$ and $B$, the space of $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring maps between the spherical groups rings $\mathbb{S}[A] \to \mathbb{S}[B]$ is equivalent to the discrete set of group homomorphisms $A \to B$. We also prove generalizations where the sphere is replaced by other ring spectra, e.g. we give a formula for the strict units in group rings of the form $R[A]$ for $A$ a finite $p$-group and $R$ $p$-completely chromatically complete.</description>

      <title>Stable equivalence relations on 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kreck's modified surgery gives an approach to classifying smooth $2n$-manifolds up to stable diffeomorphism, i.e. up to connected sum with copies of $S^n \times S^n$. In dimension 4, we use a combination of modified and classical surgery to study various stable equivalence relations which we compare to stable diffeomorphism. Most importantly, we consider homotopy equivalence up to stabilisation with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$.
  As an application, we show that closed oriented homotopy equivalent 4-manifolds with abelian fundamental group are stably diffeomorphic. We give analogues of the cancellation theorems of Hambleton--Kreck for stable homeomorphism for homotopy up to stabilisations. Finally, we give a complete algebraic obstruction to the existence of closed smooth 4-manifolds which are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent up to connected sum with $S^2 \times S^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1710.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$, we define the factorization homology of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $(\infty,1)$-categories over (possibly stratified) 1-manifolds and study some of its basic properties. In the case of spectral enrichment, we show that the value of factorization homology on a circle is topological Hochschild homology.</description>

      <title>New infinite families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify seven new $192$-periodic infinite families of elements in the $2$-primary stable homotopy groups of spheres. Although their Hurewicz image is trivial for topological modular forms, they remain nontrivial after $\mathrm{T}(2)$- as well as $\mathrm{K}(2)$-localization. We also obtain new information about $2$-torsion and $2$-divisibility of some of the previously known $192$-periodic infinite families in the stable stems.</description>

      <title>Cartesian exponentiation and monadicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.09853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important result in quasi-category theory due to Lurie is the that cocartesian fibrations are exponentiable, in the sense that pullback along a cocartesian fibration admits a right Quillen right adjoint that moreover preserves cartesian fibrations; the same is true with the cartesian and cocartesian fibrations interchanged. To explicate this classical result, we prove that the pullback along a cocartesian fibration between quasi-categories forms the oplax colimit of its "straightening," a homotopy coherent diagram valued in quasi-categories, recovering a result first observed by Gepner, Haugseng, and Nikolaus. As an application of the exponentiation operation of a cartesian fibration by a cocartesian one, we use the Yoneda lemma to construct left and right adjoints to the forgetful functor that carries a cartesian fibration over B to its obB-indexed family of fibers, and prove that this forgetful functor is monadic and comonadic. This monadicity is then applied to construct the reflection of a cartesian fibration into a groupoidal cartesian fibration, whose fibers are Kan complexes rather than quasi-categories.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>
