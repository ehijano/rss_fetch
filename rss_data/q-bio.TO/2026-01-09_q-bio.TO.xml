      <title>Mechanics of axis formation in $\textit{Hydra}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a body axis is a fundamental step in the development of multicellular organisms. In simple systems such as $\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Vertical Ground Reaction Forces Waveform Flattening during Gait in Women with Knee Osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background. Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic joint condition, and its prevalence increases with age. This study aims to examine whether flattened vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) waveforms and reduced knee range of motion (RoM) occur together during gait as compensatory strategies to maintain gait speed. Methods. Twelve women with knee OA and twelve healthy women of the same age completed the Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC) to assess self-reported pain, stiffness, and function. The groups were divided into two groups: OA vs. control 2 limbs or left and right in the Control group. A mixed-design ANOVA was used to examine differences in vertical ground response forces (VGRFs) peaks, minimum VGRF, anterior-posterior weight acceptance (ADWA) and propulsive force (ADPO), knee RoM, and gait speeds. Results. In the OA group, the mean Peak 1 vGFR was 1.109 (SD = 0.05) for the right leg (p 0.05), while the mean min vGFFR was 0.87 (SD=0.04) for the left leg. The OA leg exhibited a mean ADWA of 0.23 0.04 kg/BW, which was significantly lower than the control group's right leg (0.28 0.09 kg/bw, p0.05). No group differences in gait velocity were detected. Conclusions. We interpret the flattening of the vFGFR waveform and the reduction in knee RoM as components of an adaptive, yet potentially maladaptive, motor strategy</description>
