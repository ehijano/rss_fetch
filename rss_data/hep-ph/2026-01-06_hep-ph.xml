      <title>How to Trust Learned Loop Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order theory predictions are crucial for the precision LHC program, but the time-consuming amplitude evaluation challenges the corresponding Monte-Carlo simulations. Machine-learned amplitude surrogates can resolve this problem, if we can guarantee their precision over the entire phase space. First, we show that our surrogates provide a calibrated learned uncertainty, even for non-Gaussian systematics; second, we describe how less accurate phase space regions can be identified; third, we demonstrate how the precision in these regions can be improved reliably.</description>

      <title>Is the Conventional Picture of Coherence Time Complete? Dark Matter Recoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local solar gravitational potential forms a basin for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), with discrete energy levels. Even if barely populated, it introduces a new characteristic timescale in DM dynamics. This necessitates a generalization of the notion of coherence time. We find that, at long times, the phenomenon of recoherence emerges, whereby a subcomponent of ULDM exhibits a formally divergent coherence time. The fact that this generalized coherence time can significantly exceed the naive estimate implies an enhanced sensitivity for dark matter searches that accumulate data over extended observation periods.</description>

      <title>Distribution Amplitudes of Pseudoscalar Mesons within the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distribution amplitudes (DAs) of pseudoscalar mesons within the light-front quark model (LFQM), and the $n$-th Gegenbauer moment $a_n(\mu)$, $\xi$-moment $\langle \xi^n\rangle$ and transverse moment $\langle \mathbf{k}^n_\perp\rangle$ are also studied. Two parameter sets are adopted by fitting to mesonic decay constants or mass spectra, leading to distinct schemes for numerical analysis. Our results reveal several key insights: (1) Under scheme-I, the second Gegenbauer moment for the pion, $a_{2,\pi} = 0.054$, is in excellent agreement with predictions from the platykurtic model and the nonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\chi$QM). Meanwhile, scheme-II yields $a_{2,\pi} = 0.126$, which is consistent with lattice QCD (LQCD), Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) and data-driven light-cone sum rules (LCSR) analyses. Furthermore, we observe that $\phi_{2,\pi} = \phi^P_{3,\pi}$ with the replacement $M \to M_0$. (2) Flavor symmetry breaking effects are found to be more significant in higher-twist DAs, with a notable relation $a_1^P\approx 2 a_1$ emerging in heavy meson systems. (3) Interestingly, numerical analysis indicates that the transverse moment $\langle \mathbf{k}^n_\perp\rangle$ is twist-independent with the replacement $M\to M_0$. Additionally, we propose an empirical scaling relation $\frac{\Delta m^{0.61}}{\beta^{1.10}}x_p=0.67$ to effectively describe the shape of DAs for heavy mesons. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mass asymmetry remarkably influences DAs and kinds of moments, these theoretical predictions will be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Search for Axions and Dark Photons Using Single Molecule Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular magnets, although analogous to familiar macroscopic magnets, offer a platform for next generation magnetic storage technologies with far higher data densities and prospective applications in quantum information science. When exposed to an external magnetic field, single molecule magnets enter a frustrated magnetic configuration that is exceptionally sensitive to low energy excitations. Energy deposited by a dark matter particle can trigger the relaxation of a metastable molecule, releasing Zeeman energy that subsequently propagates through neighboring molecules. This magnetic avalanche encodes the energy deposited in the initial excitation. By combining concepts from chemistry, condensed matter physics, and particle physics, we show that dysprosium and manganese molecules can achieve more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to dark photon and QCD axion models, respectively, compared with existing detection methods.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry at High Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-scale supersymmetry (SUSY) is well motivated as a technically natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem. LHC limits on superpartners, however, have sharpened the Little Hierarchy problem, raising the question of why $m_{weak} \ll m_{soft}$. We review current collider and dark matter constraints and their implications for leading SUSY-breaking scenarios. Electroweak naturalness is revisited using a weak-scale measure that avoids ambiguities associated with high-scale fine-tuning. Also, within the string landscape, soft terms are statistically favored to be large, while anthropic selection enforces a weak scale near the observed value. This framework often termed \emph{stringy naturalness} -- naturally accommodates $m_h \simeq 125$ GeV while placing sparticles above current LHC limits. Updated HL-LHC projections for non-universal Higgs mass (NUHM) models -- the most plausible realization consistent with above picture -- show that searches for higgsinos, stops, and heavy Higgs bosons will soon begin to probe the core of the viable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Singly heavy Cascade Baryon $\Xi^0_{c}$ \&amp; $\Xi^-_{b}$ Spectroscopy in the Relativistic Framework of Independent Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the potential parameters of the independent quark model are systematically reduced using previously determined inputs from a broad range of baryons. The reduced-parameter formulation, developed within the relativistic Dirac formalism and employing a Martin-like potential, is then applied to the spectroscopy of the singly heavy baryons $\Xi_c^0$ and $\Xi_b^-$. This enables an explicit verification of the linear relation obtained between the potential parameters. Radially and orbitally excited state masses are calculated, and the resulting Regge trajectories are used to assign spin-parity to experimentally observed states. The states $\Xi_c^0(2923)$, $\Xi_c^0(3080)$, $\Xi_c^0(2882)$, and $\Xi_c^0(2970)$ are identified as having $J^P = \tfrac{1}{2}^-$, $\tfrac{3}{2}^+$, $\tfrac{3}{2}^-$, and $\tfrac{1}{2}^+$, respectively, while the observed $\Xi_b^-(6227)$ state is assigned $J^P = \tfrac{5}{2}^+$. To investigate the electromagnetic structure of these baryons, their magnetic moments and radiative decay widths are computed. Additionally, the two-body weak decay branching ratios of $\Xi_c^0$ are evaluated and contrasted with experimental data to assess the robustness of the approach. The two-body nonleptonic decays of $\Xi_b^-$ are also analyzed, providing predictions for branching ratios that may be tested in future experiments. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the parameter-reduction procedure and support its applicability in the spectroscopy of baryons.</description>

      <title>Study of time-like electromagnetic form factors of $\Lambda,~\Sigma$ and $\Xi^{+}$ in light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the light front quark model to investigate the form factors in the $e^{+}e^{-} \to B\bar{B}$ collision proceses with $B=\Lambda,~\Sigma$ and $\Xi$. These form factor behaviors are calculated based on the Bethe-Salpeter formalism with $q^{+} &gt; 0$ to effectively account for non-valence contributions. We show that our results of the $q^2$-dependent form factors closely match the BESIII data. In particalar, we obtain that $|G_{eff}| = (0.921,~0.098,~0.189$) and $R =|$$G_E\over G_M$$|= (0.97,~0.89$,~$0.936$) for $e^{+} e^{-}\to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda}$,~$\Sigma^{+} \Sigma^{-},~\Xi^{+} \Xi^{+})$ which $q^2 = (5.74,~6.0,~7.0)$ GeV$^2$.</description>

Abstract: Open questions on the fundamental nature of the strong force endure and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a once-in-a-generation laboratory elucidating its quantum origins. This document summarizes the plenary overview talk titled "QCD Studies at the LHC" presented at the Lepton Photon Symposium 2025. Selected results highlight recent experimental advances in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the LHC. This reviews the breadth of QCD and its cross-cutting synergies from a particle physics perspective in four themes: terascale precision tests, non-perturbative enigmas, mystery of confinement, and extreme cosmic-ray puzzles.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on Long-Range Neutrino Interactions using IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first search for new flavor-dependent long-range interactions (LRI) of neutrinos using publicly available 8 years of high-purity $\nu_\mu$ CC data from IceCube DeepCore. These interactions are mediated by ultra-light gauge bosons with masses below $10^{-10}$ eV, which can arise due to a new lepton-number gauge symmetry, such as $L_e - L_\mu$ or $L_e - L_\tau$. These long-range interactions induce matter potential between neutrinos and abundant electrons present in distant astrophysical sources. These LRI potentials could modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. By probing the effects of LRI on atmospheric neutrino oscillations at IceCube DeepCore, we place world-leading constraints on the coupling strength of these interactions.</description>

      <title>$B_c$ meson decays into $S$-wave charmonium plus light meson pairs in the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the $P$-wave resonance contributions to the three-body charmonium decays of $B_c\to \Psi (V\to) P_1P_2$ using the perturbative QCD formalism at leading order, where $\Psi$ denotes a $S$-wave charmonium state, such as $\eta_c(1S,2S),J/\psi$, and $\psi(2S)$. Here, $P_1P_2$ represents a collinear $\pi\pi$ ($K\pi$) pair in the final state, which was primarily produced through the vector resonance $\rho(770)$ ($K^*(892)$ ). With the improved two-meson distribution amplitudes determined from our previous works, we examined the $CP$-averaged branching ratios and polarization fractions of the considered three-body decays. The longitudinal polarization fractions of the $B_c\to [J/\psi, \psi(2S)] (V\to) P_1P_2$ decays are found to be as large as $\sim 90\%$, since the transverse amplitudes from the dominant factorizable emission diagrams are always power suppressed with respect to the longitudinal ones. The direct $CP$ violations in $B_c\to \Psi (V\to) P_1P_2$ decays are predicted naturally to be zero as they solely receive contributions from tree diagrams. Several interesting relative ratios among the branching fractions of the concerned processes are investigated. In particular, the obtained ratio $R^{\rm PQCD}_{2\pi/\pi}\equiv \mathcal{B}(B^+_c \to J/\psi(\rho\to)\pi^+\pi^0)/{\mathcal{B}(B^+_c \to J/\psi\pi^+)}=2.67^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ is consistent well with the LHCb measurement $R^{\rm exp}_{2\pi/\pi}=2.80\pm0.25$. Other similar ratios proposed in this work can be tested by LHCb experiments in the near future.</description>

      <title>Investigating $\Omega \phi$ Interaction and Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interaction between the $\Omega$ baryon and the $s\bar{s}$ meson within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model. The spectra calculations show that no bound state is formed in any of the considered channels, while the scattering indicates that the $\Omega\phi$ interaction with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ is weakly attractive. As for the $\Omega\phi$ interactions with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$, as well as the $\Omega\eta^{\prime}$ interaction with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$, they are all repulsive. After an investigation on the femtoscopic correlation functions, we find that, due to the spin-averaging effect, the overall $\Omega\phi$ correlation function exhibits a weak dependence on the source size, which provides a crucial significance of our model for future experimental examinations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Finding a clean process $B^- \to K^- D^0 K^0$ to probe absolutely exotic four-quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observations of $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}$, we propose to search for $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^0$ in the cleaner process $B^- \to K^- D^0 K^0$. In the $D^*K^*$ molecular picture, our estimates suggest that $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^0$ should contribute significantly to the $D^0 K^0$ invariant mass distribution in $B^- \to K^- D^0 K^0$, as reported by the Belle II Collaboration. The corresponding fit fraction is estimated to be $(9.72\pm 3.92)\%$. Further precise measurements of this process at Belle II and LHCb could help clarify the nature of $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)$.</description>

      <title>Topology-Informed Jet Tagging using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a topology-informed approach for classifying particle jets using persistent homology, a framework that captures the structural properties of point clouds. Particle jets produced in proton-proton collisions consist of cascades of particles originating from a common hard interaction. Each jet constituent is represented as a point in a three-dimensional feature space defined by the relative transverse momentum and angular coordinates with respect to the jet axis, yielding a point cloud description of each jet. Persistent homology is computed using a Vietoris-Rips filtration to obtain persistence diagrams, which are subsequently converted into persistence images for the H0 and H1 homology groups, corresponding to connected components and loop-like structures, respectively. These persistence images are used as inputs to a convolutional neural network for quark-gluon jet classification. Using the publicly available HLS4ML jet dataset, we find that persistence images derived from H0 and H1 individually exhibit comparable discriminative power. These results demonstrate that loop-like topological features, which are not conventionally exploited in jet tagging, encode meaningful information about jet substructure and provide a promising direction for topology-informed jet classification.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constraints on 2HDM with higher dimensional operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the requirement of perturbative unitarity restricts the parameter space of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) when higher-dimensional operators up to dimension six are included. We demonstrate that such operators can enhance scalar production cross sections in vector boson fusion relative to 2HDM. Using S-matrix unitarity, we place bounds on several dimension-six bosonic operators. We also find that certain blind directions in the Wilson coefficients of T-parameter violating operators which are poorly constrained by electroweak precision data can be partially excluded when unitarity constraints are taken into account. These results demonstrate how high-energy consistency can complement experimental limits in defining the allowed parameter space of 2HDM effective field theory.</description>

      <title>On electric fields in hot QCD: infrared regularization dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of background electric fields on a hot plasma of charged particles -- a setting relevant for the early stages of heavy-ion collisions as well as laser pulse experiments. Historically, the electric susceptibility -- encoding the behavior of the hot medium for weak fields -- has been defined within two different formalisms, leading to two distinct results at nonzero temperature. With the help of an exact fermion propagator in a homogeneous electric background field at nonzero temperature and finite volume on the one hand, and an improved perturbative result on the other, we identify the origin of this disagreement. The equilibrium conditions for the system are discussed and the role of the thermodynamic ensemble used to describe the system is highlighted. Finally, we construct the electric susceptibility in a simplified hadron resonance gas model, relevant for the strongly interacting medium in the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Gell-Mann-Okubo Formula with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering physical laws from experimental data is a fundamental goal of theoretical physics. In this work, we apply the spline-based, interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to explore the algebraic structure underlying the baryon octet and decuplet mass spectra. Within a symbolic regression framework and without imposing theoretical priors, KAN autonomously recovers the classical Gell-Mann-Okubo mass relations and accurately extracts the associated SU(3) symmetry-breaking parameters. Compared to conventional fitting approaches, this method achieves comparable predictive accuracy while offering substantially improved interpretability and analytic transparency. Our results demonstrate the potential of KAN as a powerful tool for symbolic discovery in hadron physics and for bridging data-driven modeling with fundamental physical laws.</description>

      <title>Top-quark pair production in electron-positron collisions within the minimal noncommutative Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study top-quark pair production in electron-positron collisions within the framework of the minimal noncommutative Standard Model. Noncommutative effects are incorporated using the Seiberg-Witten map, and the scattering squared amplitude for the process $e^+e^-\to t\bar{t}$ is computed consistently up to second order in the noncommutativity parameter $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$. We derive the total cross-section, the polar and azimuthal angular distributions, and the forward-backward asymmetry, all of which exhibit sensitivity to space-time noncommutativity. Numerical results are evaluated for center-of-mass energies relevant to future linear colliders, such as the ILC and CLIC. Our analysis demonstrates that noncommutative geometry can induce significant characteristic deviations from the Standard Model predictions, offering a potential indirect probe of space-time noncommutativity at high-energy $e^+e^-$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Dirac Magnetic Monopoles with Muon Beams at TeV Energies Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is the production of magnetic monopoles Drell-Yan and the Photon-Fusion mechanisms to generate velocity-dependent scalar, fermionic, and vector monopoles of spin angular momentum $0,\frac{1}{2},1$ respectively at a future muon collider. A computational study compares the monopole pair-production cross-sections for both methods at various center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}$) with different magnetic dipole moments. The comparison of kinematic distributions of monopoles at the generator and reconstructed level is demonstrated for both DY and PF mechanisms. We demonstrate the observability of magnetic monopoles against the most relevant Standard Model background using multivariate analysis techniques. Specifically, we apply three different classifiers based on neural networks, e.g., Boosted Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Likelihood methods, to evaluate their effectiveness. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of these approaches in distinguishing magnetic monopole signals from background noise.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Interpretation of Heavy-Quark Transitions and the Emergent SU(2) Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric interpretation of heavy-light mesons in which their infrared dressing is described through adiabatic Berry holonomies on the functional space of gauge configurations. Within this framework the Berry curvature associated with the infrared cloud carries a quantized functional flux, providing a simple and structural origin for the exponential form of the Isgur-Wise function in single-recoil transitions. Sequential processes such as $B \rightarrow D^{**} \rightarrow D$ probe two independent recoil directions and explore a two-dimensional region of the adiabatic manifold. In this setting the quantized flux naturally leads to a minimal non-Abelian structure which can be described effectively by an SU(2) holonomy. Heavy-quark form factors then appear as channel-dependent projections of two universal geometric modes, giving rise to correlated slopes, non-factorizable curvature in the $(w_{1},w_{2})$ plane, and characteristic angular patterns. These features are consistent with the symmetry structure of HQET while providing additional correlations among excited channels. The resulting framework offers a complementary viewpoint on heavy-quark phenomenology and suggests several experimentally testable signatures in multi-step semileptonic transitions.</description>

      <title>Notes on Magnetic Monopoles from Partial Electromagnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel partial electromagnetic duality and construct its consistent realization using an extended gauge group $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}\otimes\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$ over a localized space region, where $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$ is the conventional gauge group of QED and $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$ serves as its dual gauge group. In this framework, the "electric" charge associated with $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$ plays the role of the magnetic (monopole) charge in QED $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$, whereas the electric charge of $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$ is reinterpreted as the "magnetic" charge of $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$. Importantly, our theory preserves the exact Bianchi identity, as it provides a genuinely singularity-free and stringless formulation that involves only electric charges under each U(1) gauge group. We show that the two gauge sectors, $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$, exhibit a partial duality within a localized region of space. Based on this consistent formulation, we present the first fully gauge-invariant computation of scattering amplitudes and cross sections for monopole production processes, including $\mathrm{e}^-\mathrm{e}^+\rightarrow\chi\chi^*$ and $\mathrm{e}^-\mathrm{e}^+\rightarrow\chi\bar{\chi}$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Dark Matter from Low-Scale Spontaneous Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel type of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in which the dark matter asymmetry and the baryon asymmetry in our universe (BAU) are produced simultaneously via low-scale spontaneous leptogenesis, where the mass scale of right-handed neutrino is much lower than the Davidson-Ibarra bound $M_1 \ll 10^{9}~\rm{GeV}$. In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\rm{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>Color-Singlet and Color-Octet Quark Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarks and antiquarks carry color and electric charges and belong to the color-triplet $3$ group and the color-antitriplet $\bar 3$ group respectively. The product groups of $3$ and $\bar 3$ consist of the color-singlet $1$ and the color-octet $8$ subgroups. Therefore, quarks and antiquarks combine to form color-singlet $[q \bar q]^1$ quark matter and color-octet $[q \bar q]^8$ quark matter. The color-octet quark matter corresponds to the $q\bar q$ quark matter as envisaged in the realm of present knowledge but the color-singlet quark matter is as yet unexplored and now submitted for exploration. The color-singlet quark matter with two flavors can be separated into charged and neutral color-singlet quark matters. In the neutral color-singlet quark matter, the quark and the antiquark interacting only in the QED interaction may form stable and confined colorless QED mesons non-perturbatively at about 17 MeV and 38 MeV (PRC81,064903(2010) and JHEP(2020(8),165). It is proposed that the possible existence of the QED mesons may be a signature of the neutral color-singlet quark matter at $T=0$. The observations of the anomalous soft photons at CERN, and the anomalous bosons with mass about 17 MeV at ATOMKI, DUBNA, and HUS, and mass about 38 MeV at DUBNA hold promising experimental evidence for the existence of such QED mesons, pending further confirmations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of higher-order corrections to cross sections relevant at LHC involves the evaluation of phase-space integrals that exhibit soft and collinear divergences. The subtraction of these divergences is a key ingredient to obtain fully-differential predictions for physical observables. We discuss a subtraction method to handle these divergences based on the construction of universal local counterterms. The integration of the counterterms is carried out analytically, giving a strong control on the numerical stability of our predictions. We implement our method in a numerical program, that we dub NNLOCAL, and validate it by computing the fully-differential NNLO cross-section for Higgs boson production in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photon-Axion Mixing Driven by Dark Matter Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation in a coherently oscillating background is intrinsically a periodically driven problem. We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $\Delta_\gamma - \Delta_a \approx n m_a$ ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $\Delta_\gamma \approx \Delta_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion.</description>

      <title>Anti-collinear resummation in JIMWLK evolution in the linear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently-proposed resummation procedure for anti-collinear logarithms in the JIMWLK kernel~\cite{Kovner:2023vsy} is studied in the linear (BFKL) regime in the fixed-coupling approximation. Simple closed form expressions for the resummed momentum space kernel and characteristic function $\chi(n,\gamma)$ are found. We find that the anti-collinear pole in the leading order characteristic function at $\gamma=1$ disappears, and instead $\chi(\gamma=1)=\frac{12}{11}\frac{\pi}{\alpha_sN_c}$ for $n_F=0$. Comparison with the known NLO BFKL eigenvalue, with the target-Bjorken limit ($Q_T\gg Q_P$) of the $\gamma^*(Q_P)+\gamma^*(Q_T)$-scattering amplitude and with the ``all-poles'' resummation prescription are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic grand unification is an alternative framework to traditional quantitative unification, as the renormalisation flow leads towards an ultra-violet safe fixed point. Phenomenologically, 5-dimensional realisations permit new particles with masses as low as the TeV scale, well below the usual unification scale. We explore the impact of such models on electroweak precision observables, focusing on a minimal SU(5) template for concreteness. We show that current measurements are not sensitive to this class of models. Future colliders, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can push the 95% limit on the Kaluza-Klein mass up to 2 and 4 TeV, respectively, beyond the direct reach of the LHC programme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-orbit correlations (SOCs) of the pion using overlap of light-front wave functions (LFWFs). Going beyond the leading Fock sector, we incorporate one gluon in the wave function. The analytic form of the higher Fock component of the LFWF is constructed by incorporating a perturbative gluon to the pion state. This allows us to explore the role of quark-gluon interactions in the spin-orbit correlation within a model calculation. We investigate the kinetic and canonical spin-orbit correlations of quarks in the pion, which arise from different decompositions of the energy-momentum tensor. We further explore the difference between kinetic and canonical SOC arising from the inclusion of higher Fock sector containing gluon.</description>

Abstract: We compute the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda$ transition form factors using light-cone sum rules based on $\Lambda$-baryon distribution amplitudes, including contributions up to twist--6. The analysis is performed for pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector $b\to s$ currents and for different choices of the $\Lambda_b$ interpolating current. We find that only the pseudoscalar interpolating current leads to numerically stable and phenomenologically viable form factors. The resulting form factors are parametrised using a $z$-expansion and applied to the rare decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+ \ell^-$, yielding predictions for branching ratios in the low-$q^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Self-regularized entropy: How much do quantum black holes violate the no-hair theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a quantum black hole whose exterior is described, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static $q$-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. Counting near horizon quasinormal modes shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a streamlined method for evaluating in-in loop integrals using dimensional regularization for diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and vertices, which complements earlier work and facilitates the extraction of the ultraviolet contributions. The method leads us to identify an apparent difficulty to renormalize with Hamiltonian counterterms within the in-in formalism. We also discuss the importance of the finite parts of loop corrections that can be distinguished from their associated counterterm contributions. As an application, we examine the one-loop primordial bispectrum in the context of the effective field theory of inflation, considering a specific set of interactions, and identifying a contribution distinguishable from its tree-level counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We study equal-time in-in correlators of massless scalar fields in flat space at one loop. Using the time-ordered decomposition of correlators together with a cosmological analogue of the Baikov representation, we systematically construct relatively simple loop integrals and make manifest why, in this setting, loop corrections to correlators are simpler than those of wavefunction coefficients. As benchmark examples, we analyse the bubble and triangle diagrams. The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function. We classify the kinematic singularities of these diagrams using Landau analysis, identifying novel types of singular behaviour, and validate this analysis against the explicit results. Finally, we derive a factorisation property of one-loop cosmological correlators at singular kinematics, relating them to flat-space loop amplitudes and lower-point tree-level correlators.</description>

      <title>From the Wavefunction of the Universe to In-In-Correlators: A Perturbative Map to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.</description>

Abstract: We present studies of electron identification (eID) in the MPD experiment at NICA using machine learning techniques. The goal is to improve electron identification efficiency while preserving high purity, which is crucial for dielectron analyses. We compare electron identification performance between traditional cut-based approach and Machine learning. For machine learning based approach different classifiers, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) were trained with momentum-integrated and momentum-differential strategies using the \texttt{CERN ROOT TMVA} package.</description>

      <title>A refined model of secondary photon emission from heavy WIMP annihilations in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) remain a prominent yet less constrained dark matter (DM) candidate, with the Galactic Centre (GC) serving as a prime target for indirect detection via gamma-ray signals. Extending our previous work that highlighted the significance of secondary inverse Compton (IC) emission from annihilation-produced electrons, we expand the analysis to a broader range of WIMP masses and introduce a more realistic spatially-dependent modelling framework for the GC environment. This approach incorporates complexities such as the three-dimensional DM distribution, spatially varying radiation and magnetic fields, and electron transport mechanisms like Galactic winds and diffusion. We assess the impact of these environmental factors on both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the resulting secondary emissions. Our results demonstrate the robustness and necessity of incorporating this emission, and highlight its role in enhancing the prospects for detecting heavy WIMPs through observations of the inner Galaxy. We provide the resulting data products to the community to support future analyses and observational studies.</description>

      <title>Comment on QED Corrections to the Parity Violating Asymmetry in High-Energy Electron-Nucleus Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent letter Roca-Maza and Jakubassa-Amundsen claim a large $\approx 5\%$ radiative correction to the parity-violating asymmetry $A_{pv}$ in electron-nucleus scattering. If true, this would be important for the interpretation of the PREX, CREX, and MREX experiments. However, Roca-Maza and Jakubassa-Amundsen do not explicitly include the axial-vector vertex correction to $Z^0$ exchange (at the momentum transfer of the experiment). We show that including this cancels much of the change in $A_{pv}$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the nucleon-antinucleon system in a constituent quark model. We first construct the nucleon-antinucleon wave function such that the multiquark and multiantiquark components each satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle, and then investigate the possibility of a bound state using a Hamiltonian that includes color-color, spin-dependent interactions and three-quark potentials. Our results indicate that, in specific channels, the nucleon-antinucleon interaction exhibits significant attraction, suggesting a strong possibility of a bound state.</description>

      <title>Wilson-'t Hooft classification and the perimeter law for dyonic loops in 3d monopole semiclassics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-distance behavior of dyonic loop operators in 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ using the 3d monopole semiclassics. If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls. We confirm that the domain-wall state has the phase transition at $\theta=\pi$ in the thermal deconfined phase despite the fact that the bulk state is smooth there.</description>

      <title>Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \(\Lambda\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the unitarity of quantum field theory, through the positivity of spectral functions, underlies thermodynamic irreversibility for a subsystem separated by a horizon, in direct analogy with the irreversibility of renormalization-group flows. To this end, we explicitly find the shear and bulk viscosities -- the entanglement viscosities -- for thermal radiation in Rindler space using the universal spectral representation. A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound.</description>

Abstract: I generalize the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in the climbing scenario inspired by ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric strings to a broader class of exponential potentials, under some assumptions on the smoothing effects of String Theory that favor a bounce Cosmology. The extension can encompass the SO(16)xSO(16) model, together with other scenarios related to supersymmetry breaking in String Theory. The e-fold ranges compatible with Planck data move toward lower values of N for milder potentials and toward larger values for steeper ones. I also compute the three-point amplitudes involving graviton modes in the same bounce scenario, showing in detail their lack of peculiar contributions from the turning point.</description>

      <title>Resolution of the hyperfine puzzle and its significance for two fermion Dirac atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperfine interaction in the ground state of a hydrogen atom of assumed radius $R$ is proportional to $-1/R^3$, raising the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen, or positronium. We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\hbar/2mc$, but when $R&lt;\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses. This paper also lays out a framework for treating diquarks as relativistic Coulombic systems, in the presence of color electric and magnetic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: In order to numerically compute scattering cross sections in QCD, one needs to deal with various kinematic divergences that appear at intermediate stages of the calculation. One way of doing this is by setting up an IR subtraction scheme. In this talk we give an update on the status of extending the CoLoRFul subtraction scheme, which has been successfully used in the past for processes with only final-state hadrons, to hadron-hadron collisions. In particular we discuss the analytic computation of the integrated counterterms.</description>

We compute the effective operators that emerge at two-loop for two example models: heavy electroweak complex Triplet and Doublet scalars. We present our results on the SILH basis. We also capture the effect in the fermion sector. For these two scenarios, we compute all the fermionic effective operators up to dimension six.</description>

Abstract: The lack of evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) particles might be due to their light mass and very weak interactions, as exemplified by BSM long-lived particles (LLPs). Such particles can be produced from $B$ or $D$ hadron decays. Typically, the high values of pileup (PU) in hadron colliders are expected to pose a major challenge in light new physics searches. We propose a fresh perspective that counters this conventional wisdom: instead of viewing PU solely as an impediment, we highlight its potential benefits in searches for light LLPs from $B$ or $D$ hadron decays at HL-LHC and FCC-hh. In particular, certain forward detectors in LHC experiments, such as the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC), which are currently not utilized for LLP searches, can be repurposed with strategic modifications to play a crucial role in this endeavor. Leveraging a combination of forward and central detectors, along with smart strategies for triggering and offline analysis, we demonstrate the potential for exploring light LLPs in high PU scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an overview of recent developments in the computation of the anomalous dimension matrix of composite operators in non-forward kinematics. The elements of this matrix set the evolution of non-perturbative parton distributions such as the generalized parton distribution functions. The latter provide important information about hadronic structure and are accessible experimentally in hard exclusive scattering processes. We focus our discussion on a recent method that exploits consistency relations for the anomalous dimensions which follow from the renormalization structure of quark and gluon operators.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of inter-spacecraft laser links. Our design introduces an auxiliary interferometer to convert polarization modulation into measurable phase shifts. Analytical expressions for sensitivity to the ALDM-photon coupling are derived for various time-delay interferometry (TDI) combinations. Projected sensitivity curves demonstrate complementary coverage across the ALDM mass range $10^{-19}\sim10^{-14}\mathrm{eV}$. This approach preserves the original interferometric stability while enabling new physics capabilities for SGWDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset corresponding to the experiment's ($12202\pm180$) ${\rm kg\: d}$ exposure. We focus on evaporation of PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy. These relativistic particles, with energies up to hundreds of MeV, can generate detectable signals for masses below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Effective Parameters from Transverse Momentum Spectra of Heavy Quarkonia in Proton-Proton Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective string tension ($\kappa$) in the Schwinger mechanism and the effective temperature ($T$) in Bose-Einstein statistics are extracted from the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of heavy quarkonia produced in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also serves as the initial effective temperature (effective temperature at the initial stage) of small collision systems. This is because, despite the absence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation during the collisions, which leaves $T$ largely unaffected by QGP-related effects, the initial geometric asymmetry and local partonic thermalization still induce radial and transverse flows, thereby contributing to an increase in $T$. The effective parameters ($\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration. It is found that the multi-component distribution structured within the framework of the Schwinger mechanism or Bose-Einstein statistics can effectively describe the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra in small collision systems. With decreasing rapidity in the forward region, both $\kappa$ and $T$ increase, indicating a directly proportional relationship between them. Based on $\kappa$, the average minimum strong force radius of participant quarks is determined.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall is investigated with a view to its applications to microscopic phenomena, which are believed to have occurred during the phase transition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so that the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into account through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method of massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge with $\xi =1$ is proposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based on the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential operators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion. The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation modes are given in terms of what is known as the spectral function. The decoupling of unphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the line of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is pointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar field but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge fields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are unambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused by the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble wall during the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the Modified Minimal-subtraction Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the Standard Model (SM) with three right-handed neutrinos, the type-I seesaw model serves as the simplest and most natural scenario to successfully explain both tiny neutrino masses and the baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. In this paper, we perform a complete one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. The one-loop self-energy corrections of charged leptons and Majorana neutrinos are calculated in the $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, and the explicit expressions of all the counterterms for wave functions, fermion masses and the leptonic flavor mixing matrix are given. Furthermore, adopting the Euler-like parametrization of the $6\times 6$ unitary leptonic flavor mixing matrix, we derive one-loop renormalization-group equations for all the physical parameters in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, including neutrino masses, mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The modification of the one-loop renormalization of the original SM parameters due to the presence of heavy Majorana neutrinos is investigated as well. In this way, we provide a self-consistent theoretical framework to thoroughly test the type-I seesaw model at the one-loop level with future precision data.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Structure of an Extended Standard Model with $U(1)_D$ Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the vacuum structure of an extended standard model with a $U(1)_D$ global symmetry. The scalar sector consists of two $SU(2)$ doublets as well as one complex singlet and one real singlet, resulting in a more complicated vacuum structure compared to that of the Standard Model. We analyze various theoretical constraints, including the conditions for being bounded from below, the existence of a global minimum, and perturbativity up to the Planck scale. Additionally, we consider experimental constraints from the Higgs invisible decay. Through a detailed statistical analysis using numerical methods, we show that the extended scalar potential can accommodate a stable vacuum while satisfying both theoretical and experimental constraints for a small region of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we distinguish the isospin unambiguously to construct the diquark-diquark-antiquark type five-quark currents with the isospin $I=\frac{1}{2}$, and study the $uudc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with the QCD sum rules systematically for the first time. Then we obtain the mass spectrum of the diquark-diquark-antiquark type $uudc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with the isospin-spin-parity $IJ^P=\frac{1}{2}{\frac{1}{2}}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{5}{2}}^-$, and make possible assignments of the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4337)$, $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$. As a byproduct, we obtain the lowest hidden-charm pentaquark state which lies just above the $\bar{D}\Lambda_c$ threshold.</description>

      <title>One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the On-shell Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue to carry out the one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the on-shell scheme. Different from the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme, such an investigation is mainly motivated by the fact that the on-shell scheme has been widely adopted in the renormalization of the standard electroweak theory and implemented for its precision tests. We first specify the physical parameters in the on-shell scheme, and then fix the corresponding counterterms through on-shell renormalization conditions. In the presence of massive Majorana neutrinos, we propose a practical method to determine gauge-independent counterterms for the lepton flavor mixing matrix. With the explicit counterterms in both the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes, we establish the matching relations of the electric charge, physical masses and flavor mixing matrix elements between these two schemes. Our results in the present and previous papers lay the foundation for precision calculations in the type-I seesaw model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing di-jet resonance searches via a final-state radiation jet tagging algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the possibility of enhancing the di-jet resonance searches by tagging the final state radiation (FSR) jet, using an event-level deep neural network. It is found that solely relying on the 4-momenta of the leading three jets allows the algorithm to achieve good discriminating power that can identify the hardest FSR jet in signal, while rejecting other soft jets. Once the invariant mass is corrected with the tagged FSR jet, the mass resolution of the signal is greatly enhanced, and the sensitivity of the search is also improved by more than 10%. By crafting the input variables carefully, the algorithm introduces minimal mass sculpting for the background, and its applicability extends to a broad mass range. This work proves that FSR jet tagging can potentially enhance the di-jet resonance searches, suiting various stages of the physics programmes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are coming online and will quickly impact hadron physics once certain fidelity, decoherence and memory thresholds are met, quite possibly within a decade. We review a selected number of topics where ab-initio QCD-level information about hadrons can be obtained with this computational tool that is hard to come by from other methods. This includes high baryon-density systems such as neutron-star matter (with a sign problem in lattice gauge theory); fragmentation functions; Monte Carlo generation of particles which accounts for quantum correlations in the final state; entropy production in jets; and generally, any application where time evolution in Minkowski space (as opposed to a Euclidean formulation) or where large chemical potentials play an important dynamical role. For other problems, such as the prediction of very highly excited hadron spectroscopy, they will not be a unique, but a complementary tool.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in shaping the structure and predictions of multi-Higgs-doublet models. In three-Higgs-doublet models considerable effort has been put into classifying possible symmetry groups and the conditions for their realisation, yet the completeness of existing classifications remains an open question. In this work, we revisit the problem of identifying realisable symmetries by re-examining conventional Higgs family and general CP transformations from an alternative perspective. Our analysis identifies certain limitations in previous approaches and introduces a clearer, more systematic framework for model builders. We expand our classification by investigating more generalised symmetry structures -- the recently identified GOOFy transformations, which act non-trivially on the Higgs doublets and their conjugates. Our analysis consolidates known results, uncovers previously overlooked structures, and expands the set of symmetries in three-Higgs-doublet models, offering both a clearer theoretical foundation and a practical reference for symmetry-based model building.</description>

      <title>Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09971v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the ``effective mass" from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos. This absence of a sterile neutrino signal leads to two tests of the claim based on existing data: one for KATRIN and one for IceCube.</description>

      <title>Two-Component Dark Matter with an SU(2) Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension to the standard model incorporating a dark sector with a non-Abelian SU(2) gauge symmetry. The model yields stable dark matter candidates, protected by a residual $Z_3$ symmetry arising after the spontaneous symmetry breaking. The dark sector interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal, facilitated from mixing between the SM Higgs doublet and a dark scalar singlet. The model features two distinct DM components. We analyze theoretical and experimental constraints, including perturbativity, unitarity, vacuum stability, dark matter relic density, direct detection, indirect detection, Higgs invisible decays, dark radiation, and ellipticity. Our findings identify viable parameter spaces that satisfy these constraints, as exemplified by two benchmark points.</description>

      <title>Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) currently delivers a 1 MW, 3 GeV proton beam to the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). Power is expected to increase to 1.3 MW, driven by the needs of Hyper-Kamiokande. As a result, the MLF presently provides the highest neutron yield of any spallation source, while potentially holding the best current and foreseeable conditions for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) experimentation. We explore this potential, using as examples detector technologies presently funded for construction and under development. We quantify their sensitivity to a rich variety of particle physics scenarios, finding that very-high-statistics CE$\nu$NS measurements with significant sensitivity to relevant scenarios are feasible at this facility within the next few years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the $D$-wave isoscalar $\pi\pi/K\bar K$ coupled-channel Omn\`es matrix, formulated to satisfy unitarity, analyticity, and the appropriate asymptotic behavior. We employ a two-channel $K$-matrix model containing poles associated with the $f_{2}(1270)$ and $f_{2}'(1525)$ resonances. The resulting unitary scattering matrix, which reproduces the experimental $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi$ and $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ data and PDG information, serves as input to the homogeneous two-channel Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es equation. We compare our Omn\`es matrix with previous constructions based on $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ phases extracted from sums of Breit-Wigner amplitudes. The Omn\`es matrix developed here provides a reliable dispersive input for form-factor calculations and resonance studies in the tensor-meson sector. As an application, we show that it enables a simultaneous and accurate description of the BESIII $J/\psi\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\gamma$ and $J/\psi\to K_{S}K_{S}\gamma$ spectra in the $J=2$ electric-dipole (E1) partial wave.</description>

Abstract: The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model with Seesaw (MRSSMSeesaw) extends the MRSSM by incorporating right-handed neutrinos to generate neutrino masses via the Type-I seesaw mechanism. This work presents a detailed analysis of lepton flavor violation (LFV) processes, including $\ell_i \rightarrow \ell_j \gamma$, $\ell_i \rightarrow 3\ell_j$, and Higgs decays $h \rightarrow \ell_i \ell_j$, Based on the current experimental limitations, we carry out detailed parameter scanning and numerical calculations to analyse the effects of different sensitive parameters on LFV.The numerical results show that the non-diagonal elements involving the initial and final leptons are main sensitive parameters and LFV sources.</description>

Abstract: We study conversion processes between gravitons and dark photons and reveal the effects of dark photons on the polarization of gravitational waves. Considering cosmological dark magnetic fields, we investigate the evolution of the intensity and polarization of gravitational waves through the conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate that for minimal coupling between gravitons and dark photons, the intensity, circular polarization, and linear polarization evolve separately. We derive explicit formulas for the statistical mean and variance of the intensity and polarization when the gravitational waves pass through magnetic fields with random orientation. The formulas capture how the initial polarization of dark photons will be imprinted on the observed gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>A solution to the S8 tension through neutrino-dark matter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark matter (DM) are two of the least understood components of the Universe, yet both play crucial roles in cosmic evolution. Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</description>

Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic (EM) observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, including up-to-date $H_0$ constraints, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. We also briefly highlight the impact of systematic uncertainties, such as detector calibration, weak lensing, peculiar velocities, and host-galaxy catalog completeness, and corresponding potential mitigation strategies, which currently limit the constraint precision of cosmological parameters. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particle mediated Dark Matter with Observational Constraints: A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion-like particle (ALP) mediated dark matter (DM) effects on neutron star (NS) structure within a relativistic mean-field framework with non-linear mesonic interactions constrained by nuclear and astrophysical data. We explore DM masses \(m_\chi \in [0,1000]\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and Fermi momenta \(q_f \in [0,0.06]\,\mathrm{GeV}\), generating over 30{,}000 equations of state using two representative hadronic models, a stiff EoS (EoS1) and a soft EoS (EoS18), including a consistent crust description. A multi-level statistical filtering scheme based on voting, likelihood, and kernel density estimation is applied using constraints from radio and X-ray pulsars, GW170817, and the low-mass compact object HESS~J1731$-$347. We find that models satisfying the PSR~J0614$-$3329 radius constraint automatically comply with the HESS bound, allowing ALP-mediated DM to explain low-mass compact objects while remaining consistent with \(2\,M_\odot\) NSs. For the stiff EoS, we obtain a lower bound \(m_\chi \gtrsim 43\,\mathrm{GeV}\), with preferred values \(q_f = 0.034^{+0.020}_{-0.012}\) and \(m_\chi \in [101,949]\,\mathrm{GeV}\), while the soft EoS yields no strict lower bound, though large \(m_\chi\) and \(q_f\) are disfavored. We also develop a supervised interpolation model using \texttt{AutoGluon} to infer DM parameters from NS mass--radius curves, achieving \(R^2&gt;0.998\), and show that \(m_\chi\) is mainly constrained by global radius ratios, whereas \(q_f\) is driven by the tidal deformability \(\Lambda_{1.4}\).</description>

      <title>The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for $N&gt;3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to explore a uniform range of lattice spacings across all values of $N$, and to precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</description>

      <title>EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\phi^4$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We study primordial perturbations in Higgs--$R^2$ inflation in the presence of non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs field and the scalaron. By numerically solving the multifield background and linear perturbation equations, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the Higgs non-minimal coupling $\xi_h$. For $\xi_h \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$, transient turning of the inflationary trajectory leads to a transfer between adiabatic and isocurvature modes, generating localized features in the primordial curvature power spectrum. In contrast, in the weak-coupling regime $\xi_h \ll 1$, the curvature spectrum remains nearly featureless while isocurvature perturbations do not fully decay, resulting in a residual isocurvature component at the end of inflation. We compute the associated CMB angular power spectra and discuss the observational implications of these regimes. Our results highlight the role of multifield dynamics in shaping primordial perturbations and provide constraints on viable realizations of Higgs--$R^2$ inflation.</description>
