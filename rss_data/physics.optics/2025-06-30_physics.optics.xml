      <title>Analog Programmable-Photonic Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of digital electronics in handling real-time matrix operations for emerging computational tasks - such as artificial intelligence, drug design, and medical imaging - have prompted renewed interest in analog computing. Programmable Integrated Photonics (PIP) has emerged as a promising technology for scalable, low-power, and high-bandwidth analog computation. While prior work has explored PIP implementations of quantum and neuromorphic computing, both approaches face significant limitations due to misalignments between their mathematical models and the native capabilities of photonic hardware. Building on the recently proposed Analog Programmable-Photonic Computation (APC) - a computation theory explicitly matched to the technological features of PIP - we introduce its critical missing component: an information theory. We present Analog Programmable-Photonic Information (API), a mathematical framework that addresses fundamental concepts beyond APC by examining the amount of information that can be generated, computed and recovered in a PIP platform. API also demonstrates the robustness of APC against errors arising from system noise and hardware imperfections, enabling scalable computation without the extensive error-correction overhead required in quantum computing. Together, APC and API provide a unified foundation for on-chip photonic computing, offering a complementary alternative to digital, quantum and neuromorphic paradigms, and positioning PIP as a cornerstone technology for next-generation information processing.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable nanophotonic microcavities via integrated thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic devices that can be co-packaged with electronics and can operate in real-world environments will enable many important applications, such as optical interconnects, quantum information processing, precision measurements, spectroscopy, and microwave generation. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades on increasing the functional complexity of photonic chips. However, the most critical challenge that remains is the lack of scalable techniques to overcome perturbations arising from environmental thermal noise and thermal crosstalk from co-packaged electronics and other photonic devices sharing the same substrate. Here, we propose and demonstrate a fully-integrated scheme to monitor and stabilize the temperature of a high-Q microresonator in a Si-based chip. We show that when stabilized, the microresonator exhibits remarkable resilience against external thermal noise and can serve as a fully-integrated photonic frequency reference. By simply changing the temperature set-point, the cavity resonance frequency can be repeatably tuned without any hysteresis over several hours. We also show that the frequency of a distributed feedback (DFB) laser can be stabilized to this microresonator and realize a 48 dB reduction in its frequency drift, resulting in its center wavelength staying within +-0.5 pm of the mean over the duration of 50 hours in the presence of significant ambient fluctuations. This performance is superior to many commercial DFB systems and is highly suitable for use in data-communication systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the technique can be implemented to stabilize a soliton modelocked Kerr comb against significant ambient and crosstalk thermal noise, without the need for photodetection, paving the way for Kerr-comb-based photonic devices that can operate in the desired modelocked state indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Diffractive Metasurfaces Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator, we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and datasets.</description>

      <title>2D semiconductors as integrated light sources for plasmonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D materials are compatible with many material platforms as they adhere to other materials strictly by van der Waals interactions. This, together with the variety of band gaps found among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), makes them uniquely interesting to study for on-chip light sources, as the photonic integrated circuit (PIC) industry is developing into several material platforms depending on the application (gold, silicon, silicon nitride, indium phosphide, etc). 2D materials could thus potentially provide a universal on-chip light source (and detector) scheme for all PIC platforms in the future. Here we show recent results on how exfoliated monolayer TMDC flakes can be integrated with plasmonic slot-waveguides and plasmonic dipole antenna couplers to inject their photoluminescence into plasmonic waveguides as a first step towards future on-chip light sources for such systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Nested Hopf-Links and Conjoint Open-Arcs in Synthetic Non-Abelian Gauge Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics enriches the topological attributes of non-Abelian systems. Non-Abelian systems characterized by noncommutative braid patterns are associated with intriguing physical features and applications. Non-Abelian braiding of the non-Hermitian bands and anomalous skin mode localization may emerge due to a host of competing physical effects. The quest for the generality of their physical origin and the associated new phenomena, therefore, constitutes a pertinent question to consider. Here, we consider a synthetic gauge photonic lattice with competing sources of non-Hermiticity, i.e. NN and NNN hopping mismatches, non-Abelian SU(2) phases, and gain/loss processes. Formation of the distinctive braid patterns and nested Hopf-links is observed, which is followed by a non-Hermitian topological phase transition at EP and the opening of an imaginary gap beyond. The PBC and OBC eigenspectra and concomitant localization dynamics of the OBC eigenstates show rich physical features that are unattainable in their less complex counterparts. This includes the formation of the conjoint open-arcs in the OBC spectra which give rise to a completely localized purely dipole skin effect without any extended modes. This work sheds light on some of the key aspects of the synthetic non-Abelian gauge photonic systems in the presence of multiple competing non-Hermitian degrees of freedom that may stimulate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Design of Silicon Photonic microring resonators with complex waveguide cross-sections and minimal non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model and a rigorous method to calculate the transmission coefficient of silicon micro-rings with complex waveguide cross-section including non-linear effects and self-heating, with very short simulation times. The method is applied to the design of MRRs in the SISCAP platform with high Q and reduced non-linearity, namely due to two photon absorption and free carrier absorption. We demonstrate that the free carrier diffusion in rib waveguides and Shockely-Read-Hall recombination play a fundamental role in reducing the impact of non-linearities in the ring.</description>

      <title>Narrow beam and low-sidelobe two-dimensional beam steering on thin-film lithium niobate optical phased array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beam steering has become indispensable in free-space optical communications, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), mapping, and projection. Optical phased array (OPA) leads this field, yet conventional versions still suffer from a narrow steering field of view (FOV), insufficient sidelobe suppression, and limited angular resolution. Thin-film lithium niobate (LN), with its strong Pockels electro-optic (EO) effect, offers a powerful integrated-photonics platform to overcome these limitations. Here we present a two-dimensional (2D) EO-steered OPA based on a non-uniformly spaced X-cut thin-film LN ridge-waveguide array. A superlattice ridge design suppresses optical crosstalk to -20 dB, enabling low-sidelobe far-field radiation. Using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, we transform a uniformly spaced array into an optimized non-uniform design, largely improving angular resolution while maintaining sidelobe suppression. When combined with a single-radiating trapezoidal end-fire emitter incorporating an etched grating, the device produces a main-lobe beam width of 0.99 degree*0.63 degree from an aperture of only 140 um*250 um, achieving a wide 2D steering range of 47 degree*9.36 degree with a 20 dB sidelobe-suppression ratio. These results highlight thin-film LN OPA as a compelling route toward heterogeneous, compact, and high-performance EO beam-steering modules and ultra-miniaturized optical modulators.</description>

      <title>Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in Gaussian beams using a cylindrical lens pair with tunable focal lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for improving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics, quantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction methods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with precise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using standard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements can achieve superior performance, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer from finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a simple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian beams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The first lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the intensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed one behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial lens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the lenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped, resulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically validate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental imperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the output beam of a commercial laser source. Our method corrects astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams without requiring precise focal length matching, offering greater flexibility than other passive solutions and greater cost-effectiveness than active methods. Its simple and compact design makes it well suited for integration into both tabletop optical setups and industrial systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution for Secure Data Transmission: Toward the Future of Secured Quantum-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed network paradigm with data generation and background noise removal for diverse distributed acoustic sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising. Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore more potential fields for DAS.</description>

      <title>Generation of high power spatially-structured laser pulses via forward Raman amplification in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially-structured light with tunable intensity, wavelength, and spatiotemporal profiles has demonstrated significant potentials for fundamental and applied science, including the ultrafast and high-field physics. Nevertheless, the generation or amplification of such light towards extremely high power remains challenging due to the limitations of conventional gain media. Building upon our recently proposed forward Raman amplification (FRA) mechanism [Lei et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 255001 (2025)], here we develop a universal plasma-based amplification scheme that is capable of generating high-power structured laser beams, including vortex, Bessel, and Airy beams. Through theoretical modeling and multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that a near-infrared structured seed laser with an initial intensity of 1e12 W/cm2 can achieve 1e4~1e5-fold intensity amplification via FRA, and subsequently be self-compressed to sub-cycle duration with petawatt-level peak power. Benefiting from its exceptionally high amplification growth rate, the FRA process requires only femtosecond-scale interaction time and submillimeter propagation distance in plasma, effectively suppressing concomitant plasma instabilities. The high output intensity 1e17 W/cm2, compactness (&lt;500 um), high temporal contrast, universal applicability to diverse structured beams, and relatively easy implementation with the co-propagating configuration combine to make the FRA a disruptive approach to the generation of petawatt-class spatially-structured light, enabling unprecedented applications in high-field physics and ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.</description>

      <title>Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of a superabsorbing thin-film semiconductor metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a computational inverse design method for optimizing broadband-absorbing metasurfaces made of arbitrary dispersive media. Our figure of merit is the time-averaged instantaneous power dissipation in a single unit cell within a periodic array. Its time-domain formulation allows capturing the response of arbitrary dispersive media over any desired spectral range. Employing the time-domain adjoint method within a topology optimization framework enables the design of complex metasurface structures exhibiting unprecedented broadband absorption. We applied the method to a thin-film Silicon-on-insulator configuration and explored the impact of structural and (time-domain inherent) excitation parameters on performance over the visible-ultraviolet. Since our incorporated material model can represent any linear material, the method can also be applied to other all-dielectric, plasmonic, or hybrid configurations.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Fifth Harmonic and Five-Photon Excitation Fluorescence Multiphoton Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the application of fifth order nonlinear optical processes for multiphoton microscopy, including fifth harmonic and 5-photon excitation fluorescence. This novel imaging modality has been characterized with spectral and power dependence measurements. The advantages of fifth harmonic and 5-photon excitation fluorescence imaging are higher resolution and use of longer wavelength excitation sources, which may allow deeper penetration depth, while still exciting near-UV to blue fluorophores. This imaging modality may find interesting applications in biological research, materials characterization, geologic studies, and semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Broadband nonlinear optical microresonator array for topological second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological photonics enables robust light manipulation with third-order optical nonlinearity, yet integrating second-order optical nonlinearity into a topological system faces fundamental challenges: frequency-dependent topological bandgaps impede simultaneous edge states for pump and second harmonic photons at an octave. Here we present a broadband topological nonlinear photonic system via dual frequency topological bandgap engineering in a 2D nonlinear microresonator array. By designing a square lattice with synthetic magnetic fluxes, we achieve topological phase matching preserving unidirectional edge states for both frequencies while enabling efficient second-harmonic generation. The system exhibits flux-programmable SH chirality, where SH photons reverse propagation direction via Chern number transitions (e.g. C = -1 to +1) without sacrificing robustness. Moreover, we show that the design theoretically yields over 100 times higher SHG efficiency than single resonators at high powers via topology-enhanced coherent buildup. Our topological SHG works in a parameter regime that can be readily accessed by using existing low-loss integrated photon platforms like thin film lithium niobite.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems that feature non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). However, their usage of the entire system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to achieve a rigorous description of open many-body systems in contact with structured photonic and phononic baths. We first rationalize that this stacked hierarchy accounts for spin-squeezing and superradiant emission despite its applicability to arbitrarily many emitters. The full potential of BBGKY-HEOM is then illustrated for two relevant applications: (i) the explicit treatment of vibrational modes provides access to resonant enhancements in few-emitter lasing, and (ii) the impact of phononic coupling and charge noise on many-body electronic systems embedded in host materials (e.g. molecules in organic crystals) is as relevant as electronic correlation. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>
