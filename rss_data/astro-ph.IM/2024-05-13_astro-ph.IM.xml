      <title>Variational Inference for Acceleration of SN Ia Photometric Distance Estimation with BayeSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standarizable candles whose observed light curves can be used to infer their distances, which can in turn be used in cosmological analyses. As the quantity of observed SNe Ia grows with current and upcoming surveys, increasingly scalable analyses are necessary to take full advantage of these new datasets for precise estimation of cosmological parameters. Bayesian inference methods enable fitting SN Ia light curves with robust uncertainty quantification, but traditional posterior sampling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is computationally expensive. We present an implementation of variational inference (VI) to accelerate the fitting of SN Ia light curves using the BayeSN hierarchical Bayesian model for time-varying SN Ia spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We demonstrate and evaluate its performance on both simulated light curves and data from the Foundation Supernova Survey with two different forms of surrogate posterior -- a multivariate normal and a custom multivariate zero-lower-truncated normal distribution -- and compare them with the Laplace Approximation and full MCMC analysis. To validate of our variational approximation, we calculate the pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) diagnostic, and perform variational simulation-based calibration (VSBC). The VI approximation achieves similar results to MCMC but with an order-of-magnitude speedup for the inference of the photometric distance moduli. Overall, we show that VI is a promising method for scalable parameter inference that enables analysis of larger datasets for precision cosmology.</description>

Abstract: The convergence between astronomy and data sonification represents a significant advancement in the approach and analysis of cosmic information. By surpassing the visual exclusivity in data analysis in astronomy, innovative projects have developed software that goes beyond visual representation, transforming data into auditory and tactile displays. However, it has been evidenced that this novel technique requires specialized training, particularly for audio format data. This work describes the initial development of a platform aimed at providing training for data analysis in astronomy through sonification. The integration of these tools in astronomical education and research opens new horizons, facilitating a more inclusive and multisensory participation in the exploration of space science.</description>

      <title>DarsakX: A Python Package for Designing and Analyzing Imaging Performance of X-ray Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaging performance and sensitivity of an X-ray telescope when observing astrophysical sources are primarily governed by the optical design, geometrical uncertainties (figure errors, surface roughness, and mirror alignment inaccuracies), and the reflectivity properties of the X-ray reflecting mirror surface. To thoroughly evaluate the imaging performance of an X-ray telescope with an optical design similar to Wolter-1 optics, which comprises multiple shells with known geometrical uncertainties and mirror reflectivity properties, appropriate computational tools are essential. These tools are used to estimate the angular resolution and effective area for various source energies and locations and, more importantly, to assess the impact of figure errors on the telescope's imaging performance. Additionally, they can also be used to optimize optics geometry by modifying it in reference to the Wolter-1 optics, aiming to minimize the optical aberration associated with the Wolter-1 configuration. In this paper, we introduce DarsakX, a Python-based ray tracing computational tool specifically designed to estimate the imaging performance of a multi-shell X-ray telescope. DarsakX has the capability to simulate the impact of figure errors present in the axial direction of a mirror shell. The geometrical shape of the mirror shells can be defined as a combination of figure error with the base optics, such as Wolter-1 or Conical optics. Additionally, DarsakX allows the exploration of new optical designs involving two reflections similar to Wolter-1 optics but with an improved angular resolution for wide-field telescopes. Developed through an analytical approach, DarsakX ensures computational efficiency, enabling fast processing.</description>

      <title>Rotational transitions induced by collisions of HD$^{+}$ ions with low energy electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory-based computations have been performed, in order to produce the cross sections of rotational transitions (excitations $N_{i}^{+}-2 \rightarrow$ $N_{i}^{+}$, de-excitations $N_{i}^{+}$ $\rightarrow$ $N_{i}^{+}-2$, with $N_{i}^{+}=2$ to $10$) and of their competitive process, the dissociative recombination, induced by collisions of HD$^+$ ions with electrons in the energy range $10^{-5}$ to 0.3 eV. Maxwell anisotropic rate coefficients, obtained from these cross sections in the conditions of the Heidelberg Test Storage Ring (TSR) experiments ($k_{B}T_{t}=2.8$ meV and $k_{B}T_{l}=45$ $\mu$eV), have been reported for those processes in the same electronic energy range. Maxwell isotropic rate coefficients have been as well presented for electronic temperatures up to a few hundreds of Kelvins. Very good overall agreement is found between our results for rotational transitions and the former theoretical computations as well as with experiment. Furthermore, owing to the full rotational computations performed, the accuracy of the resulting dissociative recombination cross sections is considerably improved.</description>

      <title>Performance of the HAWC Observatory and TeV Gamma-Ray Measurements of the Crab Nebula with Improved Extensive Air Shower Reconstruction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive-air-shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1~TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, $\mathcal{O}(0.1^{\circ})$ biases in highly inclined showers, as well as enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles ($&gt; 37^{\circ}$) has improved by a factor of four at the highest energies ($&gt; 70$~TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones, based on the resulting $\chi^{2}$ values, improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of four compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources ($E^{-2.63}$) with locations overhead to 30$^{\circ}$ zenith is comparable or less than 10\% of the Crab Nebula's flux between 2 and 50~TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Detecting Moving Objects With Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific study of the Solar System's minor bodies ultimately starts with a search for those bodies. This chapter presents a review of the use of machine learning techniques to find moving objects, both natural and artificial, in astronomical imagery. After a short review of the classical non-machine learning techniques that are historically used, I review the relatively nascent machine learning literature, which can broadly be summarized into three categories: streak detection, detection of moving point sources in image sequences, and detection of moving sources in shift and stack searches. In most cases, convolutional neural networks are utilized, which is the obvious choice given the imagery nature of the inputs. In this chapter I present two example networks: a Residual Network I designed which is in use in various shift and stack searches, and a convolutional neural network that was designed for prediction of source brightnesses and their uncertainties in those same shift-stacks. In discussion of the literature and example networks, I discuss various pitfalls with the use of machine learning techniques, including a discussion on the important issue of overfitting. I discuss various pitfall associated with the use of machine learning techniques, and what I consider best practices to follow in the application of machine learning to a new problem, including methods for the creation of robust training sets, validation, and training to avoid overfitting.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for reconstruction of polarity inversion lines from solar filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar filaments are well-known tracers of polarity inversion lines that separate two opposite magnetic polarities on the solar photosphere. Because observations of filaments began long before the systematic observations of solar magnetic fields, historical filament catalogs can facilitate the reconstruction of magnetic polarity maps at times when direct magnetic observations were not yet available. In practice, this reconstruction is often ambiguous and typically performed manually. We propose an automatic approach based on a machine-learning model that generates a variety of magnetic polarity maps consistent with filament observations. To evaluate the model and discuss the results we use the catalog of solar filaments and polarity maps compiled by McIntosh. We realize that the process of manual compilation of polarity maps includes not only information on filaments, but also a large amount of prior information, which is difficult to formalize. In order to compensate for the lack of prior knowledge for the machine-learning model, we provide it with polarity information at several reference points. We demonstrate that this process, which can be considered as the user-guided reconstruction or super-resolution, leads to polarity maps that are reasonably close to hand-drawn ones, and additionally allows for uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>M3DIS - A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale stellar surveys, such as SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE, and PLATO, require accurate atmospheric models and synthetic spectra of stars for accurate analyses of fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The primary goal of our work is to develop a new approach to solve radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) and generate model stellar spectra in a self-consistent and highly efficient framework. We build upon the Copenhagen legacy RHD code, the MULTI3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) code, and the DISPATCH high-performance framework. The new approach allows us to calculate 3D RHD models of stellar atmospheres on timescales of a few thousand CPU hours and to perform subsequent spectrum synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or NLTE for the desired physical conditions within the parameter space of FGK-type stars. We compare the 3D RHD solar model with other available models and validate its performance against solar observations, including the centre-to-limb variation of intensities and key solar diagnostic lines of H and Fe. We show that the performance of the new code allows to overcome the main bottleneck in 3D NLTE spectroscopy and enables calculations of multi-dimensional grids of synthetic stellar observables for comparison with modern astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Accounting for selection biases in population analyses: equivalence of the in-likelihood and post-processing approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I show the equivalence, under appropriate assumptions, of two alternative methods to account for the presence of selection biases (also called selection effects) in population studies: one is to include the selection effects in the likelihood directly; the other follows the procedure of first inferring the observed distribution and then removing selection effects a posteriori. Moreover, I investigate a potential bias allegedly induced by the latter approach: I show that this procedure, if applied under the appropriate assumptions, does not produce the aforementioned bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest molecular data - potential energy curves and Rydberg$/$valence interactions - characterizing the super-excited electronic states of CO are reviewed, in order to provide inputs for the study of their fragmentation dynamics. Starting from this input, the main paths and mechanisms for CO$^+$ dissociative recombination are analyzed; its cross sections are computed using a method based on Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory. Convoluted cross sections, giving both isotropic and anisotropic Maxwellian rate-coefficients, are compared with merged-beam and storage-ring experimental results. The calculated cross sections underestimate the measured ones by a factor of $2$, but display a very similar resonant shape. These facts confirm the quality of our approach for the dynamics, and call for more accurate and more extensive molecular structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite-mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <title>Advancing Precision Particle Background Estimation for Future X-ray Missions: Correlated Variability between AMS and Chandra/XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles have a significant impact on the particle-induced background of X-ray observatories, and their flux exhibits substantial temporal variability, potentially influencing background levels. In this study, we present one-day binned high-energy reject rates derived from the Chandra-ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instruments, serving as proxies for GCR particle flux. We systematically analyze the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates and compare them with the AMS proton flux. Our analysis initially reveals robust correlations between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates when binned over 27-day intervals. However, a closer examination reveals substantial fluctuations within each 27-day bin, indicating shorter-term variability. Upon daily binning, we observe finer. temporal structures in the datasets, demonstrating the presence of recurrent variations with periods of $\sim$ 25 days and 23 days in ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively, spanning the years 2014 to 2018. Notably, during the 2016--2017 period, we additionally detect periodicities of $\sim$13.5 days and 9 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively. Intriguingly, we observe a time lag of $\sim$ 6 days between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates during the second half of 2016. This time lag is not visible before 2016 and aftern2017. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this time lag remain a subject of ongoing investigation.</description>

      <title>Implicit Electric Field Conjugation Through a Single-mode Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connecting a coronagraph instrument to a spectrograph via a single-mode optical fiber is a promising technique for characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets with ground and space-based telescopes. However, due to the small separation and extreme flux ratio between planets and their host stars, instrument sensitivity will be limited by residual starlight leaking into the fiber. To minimize stellar leakage, we must control the electric field at the fiber input. Implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) is a model-independent wavefront control technique in contrast with classical electric field conjugation (EFC) which requires a detailed optical model of the system. We present here the concept of an iEFC-based wavefront control algorithm to improve stellar rejection through a single-mode fiber. As opposed to image-based iEFC which relies on minimizing intensity in a dark hole region, our approach aims to minimize the amount of residual starlight coupling into a single-mode fiber. We present broadband simulation results demonstrating a normalized intensity greater than 10^{-10} for both fiber-based EFC and iEFC. We find that both control algorithms exhibit similar performance for the low wavefront error (WFE) case, however, iEFC outperforms EFC by approximately 100x in the high WFE regime. Having no need for an optical model, this fiber-based approach offers a promising alternative to EFC for ground and space-based telescope missions, particularly in the presence of residual WFE.</description>

Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment that includes small-aperture telescopes (SATs) observing from an altitude of 5,200 m in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The SO SATs will cover six spectral bands between 27 and 280 GHz to search for primordial B-modes to a sensitivity of $\sigma(r)=0.002$, with quantified systematic errors well below this value. Each SAT is a self-contained cryogenic telescope with a 35$^\circ$ field of view, 42 cm diameter optical aperture, 40 K half-wave plate, 1 K refractive optics, and $&lt;0.1$ K focal plane that holds $&gt;12,000$ TES detectors. We describe the nominal design of the SATs and present details about the integration and testing for one operating at 93 and 145 GHz.</description>

      <title>Identification of problematic epochs in Astronomical Time Series through Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for detecting outliers in astronomical time series based on the combination of a deep neural network and a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with the aim of identifying and removing problematic epochs in the light curves of astronomical objects. We use an EfficientNet network pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor and perform a k-nearest neighbor search in the resulting feature space to measure the distance from the first neighbor for each image. If the distance is above the one obtained for a stacked image, we flag the image as a potential outlier. We apply our method to time series obtained from the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) monitoring campaign of the Deep Drilling Fields of the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We show that our method can effectively identify and remove artifacts from the VST time series and improve the quality and reliability of the data. This approach may prove very useful in sight of the amount of data that will be provided by the LSST, which will prevent the inspection of individual light curves. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of our method and suggest possible directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the X-ray SOI pixel detector with the on-chip ADC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: XRPIX is the monolithic X-ray SOI (silicon-on-insulator) pixel detector, which has a time resolution better than 10 $\rm{\mu}$s as well as a high detection efficiency for X-rays above 10 keV. XRPIX is planned to be installed on future X-ray satellites. To mount on satellites, it is essential that the ADC (analog-to-digital converter) be implemented on the detector because such peripheral circuits must be as compact as possible to achieve a large imaging area in the limited space in satellites. Thus, we developed a new XRPIX device with the on-chip ADC, and evaluated its performances. As the results, the integral non-linearity was evaluated to be 6 LSB (least significant bit), equivalent to 36 eV. The differential non-linearity was less than 0.7 LSB, and input noise from the on-chip ADC was 5~$\rm{e^{-}}$. Also, we evaluated end-to-end performance including the sensor part as well as the on-chip ADC. As the results, energy resolution at 5.9 keV was 294 $\rm{\pm}$ 4 eV in full-width at half maximum for the best pixel.</description>

      <title>Climbing the Cliffs: Classifying YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs JWST Data using a Probabilistic Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the first observations released to the public from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was a section of the star-forming region NGC 3324 known colloquially as the "Cosmic Cliffs." We build a photometric catalog of the region and test the ability of using the Probabilistic Random Forest machine learning method to identify its Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). We find 450 candidate YSOs (cYSOs) out of 19~497 total objects within the field, 413 of which are cYSOs not found in previous works. These classifications are verified with several different metrics, including recall and precision. Using the obtained probabilities of objects being YSOs, we employ a Monte Carlo approach to determine the surface density of cYSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs, which we find to be largely coincident with column densities derived from Herschel data, up to a column density of 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The newly determined number and spatial distribution of YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs demonstrate that JWST is far more capable of detecting YSOs in dusty regions than Spitzer. Comparisons of the observed colors and brightness of faint cYSOs with those of pre-main-sequence models suggest JWST has detected a significant population of sub-stellar YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs. The size of this population further suggests previous estimates of star formation efficiencies in molecular clouds have been systematically low.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave memory and quantum Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examined the output of a quantum Michelson interferometer incorporating the combined effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction and time-varying gravitational fields. Our findings indicate a deviation from the standard relationship between the phase shift of the interferometer's output and the amplitude of gravitational waves. This deviation, a slight offset in direct proportionality, is associated with the gravitational wave memory effect under the conventional settings of interferometer parameters. Furthermore, the results suggest that consecutive gravitational wave memory, or the stochastic gravitational wave memory background (SGWMB), contributes not only to the classical red noise spectrum but also to a quantum red noise spectrum through this new mechanism. This leads to a novel quantum noise limit for interferometers, which may be crucial for higher precision detection system. Our analysis potentially offers a more accurate description of quantum interferometers responding to gravitational waves and applies to other scenarios involving time-varying gravitational fields. It also provides insights and experimental approaches for exploring how to unify the quantum effects of macroscopic objects and gravitation.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously search for multi-target Galactic binary gravitational waves in reduced parameter space with LMPSO-CV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative approach to the concurrent exploration of gravitational waves originating from Galactic binaries through the development of a new Local Maxima Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO) algorithm. Our methodology employs strategic Create Voids (CV) to streamline parameter space, maximizing the identification of local maxima for the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic even in the overlapped signals case. Subsequently, a "find-real-$\mathcal{F}$-statistic-analysis", which implements the astrophysical models and properties of $\mathcal{F}$-statistic in parameter space, is conducted to reveal Galactic binary gravitational wave signals within the dataset. Our new approach eliminates inaccuracies associated with signal subtraction contamination, which is a challenge for traditional iterative-subtraction method when addressing low signal-to-noise ratio signals (e.g., SNR $&lt;$ 15). We also consider the effect of overlapping signals and degeneracy noise. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we utilize the residuals from the LISA mock data challenge (LDC1-4), where 10982 injection sources with SNR $\ge$ 15 have been eliminated. For the remaining low SNR sources (SNR $&lt;$ 15), the LMPSO-CV method efficiently identifies 8995 signals with a 52.3\% detection rate or 3463 signals with a 73.1\% detection rate when the correlation coefficient threshold $R_t$ is set to 0.8.</description>

      <title>Flat silicon gradient index lens with deep reactive-ion-etched 3-layer anti-reflection structure for millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a 100 mm diameter, flat, gradient-index (GRIN) lens fabricated with high-resistivity silicon, combined with a three-layer anti-reflection (AR) structure optimized for 160-355 GHz. Multi-depth, deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) enables patterning of silicon wafers with sub-wavelength structures (posts or holes) to locally change the effective refractive index and thus create anti-reflection layers and a radial index gradient. The structures are non-resonant and, for sufficiently long wavelengths, achromatic. Hexagonal holes varying in size with distance from the optical axis create a parabolic index profile decreasing from 3.15 at the center of the lens to 1.87 at the edge. The AR structure consists of square holes and cross-shaped posts. We have fabricated a lens consisting of a stack of five 525 $\mu$m thick GRIN wafers and one AR wafer on each face. We have characterized the lens over the frequency range 220-330 GHz, obtaining behavior consistent with Gaussian optics down to -14 dB and transmittance between 75% and 100%.</description>
