      <title>Ionisation potentials and energy levels of ions of heavy and superheavy elements Te, I, Po, At, Lv and Ts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the energy levels and successive ionisation potentials (IPs) of ions of the three heaviest known Group 16 and 17 elements using a theoretical approach that combines the linearised coupled-cluster method, configuration interaction, and perturbation theory. Our calculations address critical gaps in the available data on the electronic structure of the superheavy elements livermorium (Lv) and tennessine (Ts), as well as their lighter homologues polonium (Po) and astatine (At). To assess the accuracy of our methods, we perform analogous calculations for the lighter homologues tellurium (Te) and iodine (I), for which both experimental and reliable theoretical data are available for comparison.</description>

      <title>Lande g-factor measurements for the 5d6s 3D2 hyperfine levels of 176Lu+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the Lande g-factors for the 5d6s $^3$D$_2$ hyperfine levels of $^{176}$Lu$^+$ to a fractional inaccuracy of $5\times 10^{-7}$. Combining these measurements with theoretical calculations allows us to estimate hyperfine-mediated modifications to the quadrupole moments for each state and infer a value of $\delta\Theta = 1.59(34)\times 10^{-4} \,ea_0^2$ for the residual quadrupole moment of the $^1S_0\leftrightarrow{^3}D_2$ hyperfine-averaged clock transition.</description>

      <title>Probing subradiant dynamics in cold atomic ensembles via population and emitted light measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report on the time- and space-resolved measurement of subradiant excited state population in an ultra-cold atomic cloud of 174Yb atoms. We use a depletion imaging technique that exploits the V-type internal energy structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms to directly observe the time-resolved spatial distribution of excited state population. We characterize the decay dynamics of the subradiant modes using both the excited state population and scattered light intensity, finding good quantitative agreement with numerical predictions from simulations of two-level atomic ensembles.</description>

      <title>A phase-modulation interferometer for intense, ultrashort, near infrared laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of coherent phenomena in strong-field processes requires interferometric measurement schemes with high selectivity to disentangle the complex nonlinear response of the system. Interferometers combining acousto-optical phase modulation with lock-in detection feature excellent dynamic range and highly selective detection, thus providing a promising solution. However, acousto-optical modulators (AOMs) cause several issues when operated with intense, ultrashort, near infrared (NIR) laser pulses. The AOMs introduce temporal and angular dispersion, self-phase modulation and reduced acousto-optic efficiency at NIR wavelengths. Here, we present an acousto-optical phase modulation interferometer design that solves these issues. The presented solutions pave the way for the investigation of strong-field processes with phasemodulated interferometry and are also useful to improve the performance of phase-modulation interferometers in other applications.</description>

      <title>Ultracold high-spin $\Sigma$-state polar molecules for new physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose high-spin $\Sigma$-state polar molecules assembled from ultracold atoms to probe charge-parity violating physics beyond the Standard Model. We identify YbCr as a prime candidate to search for the electric dipole moment of the electron. We show that the combination of relativistic ytterbium and high-spin chromium, amenable to magneto-association, leads to molecules with easy-to-polarize parity doublets and large intramolecular electric fields. Based on \textit{ab initio} results for molecular constants, we predict a sensitivity of $\delta d_{\textrm{e}}= ( 6 \times 10^{-31} / \sqrt{n_{\mathrm{day}}})\,e\,\mathrm{cm}$ via standard spin-precession measurements, we assess the experimental feasibility, and discuss potential extensions to more advanced quantum control as well as searches of the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment. This work paves the way to next-generation searches for new physics with ultracold molecules in both the leptonic and hadronic sectors.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung induced atomic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed spectra in the collisions of neon (Ne) projectiles of 1.8 and 2.1 MeV with an aluminum target (Al) have been successfully segregated from strong bremsstrahlung backgrounds and then analyzed by comparing the transition energies and rates with the theoretical predictions of the flexible atomic structure code and the general purpose relativistic atomic structure package. The spectra contain K{\alpha}, Kh{\alpha} , and K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines. The K{\alpha}{\alpha} emissions are due to two-electron one-photon transitions. Interestingly, the K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines in projectile ions are only seen with 1.8 MeV energy. In contrast, the K{\alpha}{\alpha} lines in the target ions are also well observed with 2.1 MeV energy. Surprisingly, the Al K x-ray line intensities are strongly suppressed, and the K{\alpha}{\alpha} line intensities are unexpectedly enhanced. The underlying physical process is found to be the photoionization caused by intense bremsstrahlung radiation. This photoionization process converts most of the singly ionized K shell states (\approx 82\% at 2.1 MeV) to doubly ionized K shell states. This phenomenon is silently present on many occasions. We take some of such events to validate this remarkable finding. This bremsstrahlung radiation induced secondary ionization process stands as an eye opening incidence to the plasma physics, astronomy and astrophysics communities; may revolutionize these fields of research.</description>

      <title>Probing Instantaneous Single-Molecule Chirality in the Planar Ground State of Formic Acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that individual molecules of formic acid are chiral even when they are in the vibronic ground state, which has a planar equilibrium structure. We ionize the C 1s shell of the molecule and record the photoelectron in coincidence with positively charged fragments. This provides two consecutive measurements of the structure of one molecule, the first by photoelectron diffraction imaging and the second by Coulomb explosion imaging. We find that both measurements show the same handedness of the specific molecule. The phenomenon of being achiral on average but chiral at the level of individual molecules is general to most prochiral molecules and is a consequence of the three-dimensional zero-point delocalization of the nuclei in the vibrational ground state.</description>

Abstract: Advanced theoretical techniques that combine the linearized coupled-cluster method, configuration interaction method, and perturbation theory are used to calculate energy levels, ionization potentials, electron affinities, field isotope shift, and static dipole polarizabilities of the superheavy elements Lv and Ts, along with their lighter analogs Te, I, Po, and At. Calculations for the heavy elements, Po, At, Lv, and Ts are used to address the gaps in the experimental data. Calculations for the lighter elements, Te and I (and partly Po and At) are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the calculations.</description>

      <title>Fast programmable entanglement of Barium ion qubits using Rydberg states and AC-Stark shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scheme for excitation and individual addressing using Rydberg states of trapped Barium ions is presented for the purpose of fast gates and entanglement. Dipole matrix elements, dynamic polarizabilities, and one- and two-photon transition strengths are computed with a Supersymmetric Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (SWKB) method. A favorable two-photon excitation transition is identified, linking the 7s$1/2$ state to high-lying Rydberg states, with the strongest transition found to be 7s12-&gt;38s12. Additionally, the 7s1/2 state exhibits high polarizability around the telecom band at 1310 nm, enabling significant AC-Stark shift control with a turnkey laser at low power. This facilitates an individual addressing scheme by varying light intensity across an ion crystal, supporting sub-microsecond entangling gates between ion pairs with the strong and microwave-tunable Rydberg dipolar interaction. Selective addressing of individual ions by laser frequency tuning using the 6p3/2-&gt;7s1/2 transition is proposed.</description>

      <title>Mitigating higher-band heating in Floquet-Hubbard lattices via two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-photon resonances to high-lying energy levels represent an unavoidable source of Floquet heating in strongly driven quantum systems. In this work, we extend the recently developed two-tone approach of 'cancelling' multi-photon resonances to shaken lattices in the Hubbard regime. Our experiments show that even for strong lattice shaking the inclusion of a weak second drive leads to cancellation of multi-photon heating resonances. Surprisingly, the optimal cancelling amplitude depends on the Hubbard interaction strength $U$, in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalisation calculations. Our results call for novel analytical approaches to capture the physics of strongly-driven-strongly-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS with nontrivial spatial connectivity. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</description>
