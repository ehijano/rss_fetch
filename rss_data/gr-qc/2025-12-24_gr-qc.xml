      <title>Buchdahl limits in theories with regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalizations of Buchdahl's compactness limits for perfect-fluid star solutions of $D$-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to higher-curvature corrections. We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid.</description>

      <title>Mass and entropy of asymptotically flat eternal quantum black holes in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-classical dilaton gravity in (1+1)-dimensions remains one of the only arenas where quantum black holes can be exactly constructed, fully accounting for backreaction due to quantum matter. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the mass and thermodynamic properties of static asymptotically flat quantum black holes both analytically and numerically. First, we analytically investigate eternal quantum black hole solutions to a one-parameter family of analytically solvable models interpolating between Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius and Bose, Parker, and Peleg gravities. Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts. In the process, we develop an analytic expansion of the solutions and find it accurately approximates the full numerical solutions in the semi-classical limit.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model anisotropic neutron stars using three distinct prescriptions for pressure anisotropy, the Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and Covariant models, and three equations of state with different particle compositions, each described by a piecewise polytropic parametrization with continuous sound speed. The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant Bardeen variables for plane waves and their relation to Cartan and Killing invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism is traditionally used to analyze the polarization content of gravitational waves, while the gauge-invariant Bardeen formalism provides a complementary, and often simpler, description based on the irreducible scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations of the metric. In this work we apply the Bardeen formalism to plane gravitational waves in Minkowski spacetime, computing all scalar, vector, and tensor gauge-invariant variables explicitly and demonstrating that only the two transverse-traceless tensor modes survive, as expected for vacuum waves in general relativity.
  We then compare these Bardeen variables with curvature-based invariants constructed using the linearized Cartan--Karlhede (CK) algorithm. We show that the CK invariants do not distinguish the $\oplus$ and $\times$ modes. Instead, we show that the Bardeen variables coincide with the Killing invariants obtained by projecting the metric perturbation onto the translational Killing vectors of the Minkowski background. Thus, in the plane-wave case, the physical gravitational-wave degrees of freedom are encoded in invariants generated from the Killing vector fields, rather than Cartan invariants.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Nat\'ario's Zero-Expansion Warp Drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed analysis of Nat'{a}rio's ``zero-expansion'' warp drive spacetime, focusing on scalar curvature invariants within the 3+1 formalism. This paper has four primary objectives: First, we establish the Petrov type classification of Nat'{a}rio's spacetime, which has not been previously determined in the literature. We prove that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime is Petrov type I, not fitting the Class B warped product spacetime definition. Second, we assess the relative magnitude of the Weyl scalar curvature invariant and compare it with the amplitudes of Einstein's scalar and the Ricci quadratic and cubic invariants within the warp-bubble zone. Previous studies have focused on Ricci curvature and the energy-momentum tensor, neglecting the Weyl curvature, which we demonstrate plays a significant role due to the sharp localization of the form function near the warp-bubble radius. Third, we visualize several curvature invariants for Nat'{a}rio's warp drive, as well as momentum density, which we show as the critical physical quantity governing the orientation of the warp drive trajectory, overshadowing space volume changes. Fourth, we critically examine claims that Nat'{a}rio's warp drive is more realistic than Alcubierre's. We demonstrate that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime exhibits curvature invariant amplitudes 35 times greater than Alcubierre's, given identical warp-bubble parameters, making Nat'{a}rio's concept even less viable. Additionally, we address Mattingly et al.'s analysis, highlighting their underestimation of curvature invariant amplitudes by 21 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dissipative cosmology with $\Lambda$ from the first law of thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We phenomenologically derive a cosmological model that includes both a cosmological constant term $\Lambda/3$ and a dissipative driving term $\beta (2 H^{2} + \dot{H})$ by applying the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology. Here $H$, $\dot{H}$, and $\beta$ are the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of $H$, and a non-negative dimensionless coefficient, respectively. The dissipative term is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature, suggesting that the dynamic creation pressure has the same dependence. We examine the model's background evolution in the late universe and its horizon thermodynamics. The present model supports a transition from a decelerating universe to an accelerating universe when $\beta &lt;0.5$. The second law of thermodynamics is always satisfied on the horizon, and maximization of entropy is satisfied in the final stage. We examine constraints on the present model using observed Hubble parameter data and the transitional and thermodynamic constraints and find that a weakly dissipative universe with $\Lambda$ is likely favored and consistent with our Universe. We also discuss irreversible entropy due to adiabatic particle creation, assuming a holographic-like matter creation cosmology.</description>

      <title>Measuring Eccentricity and Addressing Waveform Systematics in GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave event GW231123_135430 is the heaviest binary black hole system observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA Collaboration to date, with the initial analysis indicating the individual black hole masses lie within or above the theorized pair-instability mass gap of roughly $60$--$130\,M_\odot$. The inference further suggests that both black holes possess high spins, measured to be $0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$. Therefore, the observation of this event suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond the standard stellar collapse. However, different waveform models yield significantly different parameter estimates, possibly due to missing physics in the models used in inference. In this work, we carry out a reanalysis of GW231123 using a physically complete model, accounting for both spin precession and eccentricity. Our analysis shows that this event does not exhibit strong evidence for eccentricity and the exclusion of eccentricity has minimal impact on inference. Furthermore, for GW231123-like systems, even eccentricities as large as $0.15$ at $10$ Hz do not yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement. Through a zero-noise injection recovery study, we show that the observed discrepancies in the parameter estimates can be explained by disagreement in the waveform models at strong spin precession, with the degree of parameter bias in the zero-noise runs being comparable to that observed for the real signal. We also show that inference performed with an eccentric, aligned-spin waveform model can yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement due to the degeneracy between eccentricity and spin precession. Bayesian model selection, however, rules out this interpretation in favor of the eccentric, spin precessing hypothesis, which supports zero eccentricity -- a conclusion we confirm with additional zero-noise injection-recovery tests.</description>

      <title>Entropy of matter on the Carroll geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two prescriptions, the expansion of near horizon of geometry and expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), of constructing Carroll geometries are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very near to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore the present analysis re-assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using gravitational decoupling under the requirements of a well-defined event horizon and the source matter satisfying the weak energy condition, we construct nonsingular hairy black holes with spherical or axial symmetry. These solutions emerge from a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum, bridging the novel hairy geometries and the classical Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions at the maximum deformation in their respective sectors.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Sources Teleparallel Robertson--Walker $F(T)$-Gravity Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$-gravity solutions for a cosmological electromagnetic source in the current paper. We use and solve the TRW $F(T)$-gravity field equations (FEs) for each value of the $k$-parameter $(-1,\,0,\,+1)$ and the electromagnetic equivalent of the equation of state (EoS), leading to new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For the $k=0$ cosmological case, we find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for any scale factor $n$. For $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find exact and far-future approximated new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and infinitely fast universe expansion summarized by analytical functions. All the new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications, implying any electromagnetic source processes, such as the cosmological plasma models.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics of Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective dynamics of the Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime inspired by loop quantum gravity is studied. Two different schemes are considered to regularize the Hamiltonian constraint for the quantum dynamics. In the $\mu_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $\mu_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions. Hence, the effective theory in this scheme does not remain valid throughout the full spacetime.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions with a linear equation of state in Ho\v{r}ava gravity and Einstein-Aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a methodology to obtain black hole (BH) solutions in Ho\v{r}ava gravity (HG) and Einstein Aether (AE) theory for the spherically symmetric (SS) case with a static aether. This methodology consists of first specifying the form of the equation of state (EoS), rather than prescribing an energy density profile. The usual EoS for the static and SS case, $\rho = -p_r$, is no longer satisfied due to the presence of the HG AE terms. We study three linear EoS associated with: an analogue charged BH, a non-trivial extremal BH, and an ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, respectively. The HG AE terms lead to exotic behaviors, both in the physical properties of the solutions and in their thermodynamics. In Case I, the matter sources can be interpreted as an exotic anisotropic matter distribution, giving rise to an effective electric-potential term in the geometry. In Case II, we obtain a non trivial extremal BH solution for which the event horizon is $n_{\text{odd}}$ fold degenerate. In Case III, we find a solution with a non trivial repulsive potential, where the influence of the HG AE terms at short scales leads to the formation of a BH remnant whose horizon encloses a central singularity (instead of a de Sitter core as occurs in regular BHs).</description>

      <title>Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.</description>

      <title>Kerr Isolated Horizon Revisited: Caustic-Free Congruence and Adapted Tetrad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the near-horizon description of the Kerr space-time in the isolated horizon formalism using a non-twisting null geodesic congruence and eliminate the coordinate and geodesic pathologies that arise when the Carter constant of motion is globally fixed to a single constant. Adopting instead a previously proposed choice of the Carter constant which depends on the polar angle on the horizon, we obtain an analytic construction of the Newman--Penrose tetrad adapted to isolated horizons together with horizon-adapted coordinates in which its defining properties are manifest. We compute the associated curvature scalars and provide initial data on characteristics for the isolated horizon. In addition to an analytical solution, derived by leveraging extensive results on Kerr null geodesics, we develop two complementary series expansions and outline a practical numerical recipe to make the construction readily usable. Relative to earlier treatments, our formulation avoids caustic-induced breakdowns and incomplete coordinate coverage while yielding a detailed description of the Kerr black hole in the isolated horizon approach.</description>

      <title>Eckart heat-flux applicability in $F(\Phi,X)R$ theories and the existence of temperature gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in single--scalar theories of the form $\mathcal{L}=F(\Phi,X)R+G(\Phi,X)$, a generic nonminimal coupling $F(\Phi,X)$ induces, in the scalar--comoving frame, an additional transverse contribution to the effective heat flux, proportional to $(F_X/8\pi F)V_{\perp a}$, where $V_a \equiv h_a{}^c\nabla_c\nabla_d X\,u^d$ and $V_{\perp a}$ denotes the component orthogonal to the 4--acceleration $a_a$. This new term, that is not present in $F(\Phi)R$ scalar-tensor theories, cannot in general be written as a spatial temperature gradient, and therefore obstructs a standard Eckart interpretation of the scalar sector for arbitrary timelike scalar configurations. As a result, requiring an Eckart heat flux $q_a = -K\bigl(D_a T_g + T_g\, a_a\bigr)$ for all such configurations is possible if and only if $F_X(\Phi,X)\equiv 0$, i.e.\ $F(\Phi,X)=F(\Phi)$, resulting in a theory that is a subclass of Horndeski. Thus, only Jordan--like theories of the type $F(\Phi)R+G(\Phi,X)$ admit a global Eckart fluid picture of the scalar sector, while models with $F_X\neq 0$ can recover an Eckart--like form only on highly symmetric backgrounds where the transverse contribution vanishes or collapses to a single gradient direction. We also make a brief comment on the existence of temperature gradients $D_aT_g$.</description>

      <title>Spin-induced quadrupole moment based test for eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-induced quadrupole moment-based test of black hole nature is routinely used to probe the true nature of detected binary signals, assuming a circular orbit. We extend the applicability of the method to binaries in eccentric orbits. Considering simulated signals of varying masses, spins, and signal strengths, we demonstrate how the systematic errors resulting from neglecting orbital eccentricity compare with the statistical errors, using a semi-analytic Fisher matrix-based formalism that accounts for both current and future detectors. Further, we quantify the systematic errors by developing a Bayesian inference framework for the current detector network. The inspiral-only aligned spin gravitational wave waveform model for eccentric binaries, TaylorF2Ecc, is employed. For the current detector network, neglecting an initial eccentricity of $e_0^{\rm inj}=0.1$ defined at $20\,\mathrm {Hz} $ can lead to a serious bias in binary parameter inference. Notably, a nearly equal-mass, moderately spinning binary black hole in an eccentric orbit can be identified as a non-black hole binary with extreme spins and asymmetric masses. We demonstrate the criticality of biased estimates that may arise when neglecting the orbital eccentricity while performing tests of black hole nature and discuss prospects.</description>

      <title>Squeezed States in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for the production of squeezed quantum states of the gravitational field in linearized quantum gravity. Time-dependent couplings in the quadratic part of the action generically produce squeezed states from the vacuum. Using the harmonic oscillator as an example, we describe three techniques to obtain the squeezing parameter from such quadratic terms. For gravity, the action to quadratic order in metric perturbations contains couplings both to background curvature as well as to matter sources. Thus, both time-dependent classical spacetimes and time-dependent classical matter typically produce squeezed states of gravity.</description>

      <title>Random matrix product state models of gravitationally prepared states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11966v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally prepared states are quantum field theoretic states prepared by gravitational path integrals with spatial boundaries that have fixed boundary conditions for gravity but not for matter fields. They can be interpreted as quantum field theoretic states of closed universes encoding quantum gravitational effects of the past. We propose a method of modelling gravitationally prepared states in two dimensions with random matrix product states (RMPS). Such RMPS models allow us to exactly define and compute contributions of higher topologies and replica geometries in the gravitationally prepared state to all orders. We show that the bra-ket wormhole phase transition, a crucial physical property of gravitationally prepared states, is ensured if the transfer matrix of the RMPS satisfies the spectral gapping property, which we define, and define a class of models called $\mathrm{O}(k)$ models satisfying this property. A novel advantage of RMPS models is that they allow us to compute the effects of off-shell wormholes, i.e., wormhole topologies without semiclassical solutions. In particular, using RMPS models, we find that off-shell wormholes lead to nonzero long-distance correlators in gravitationally prepared states. We also define RMPS models in continuous space, and discuss implications for studying de Sitter gravitationally prepared states.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent flux backgrounds in type IIB supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor. Our solutions include cases with all fluxes (three-form and self-dual five-form) switched on, as well as cases with subsets of these fluxes, together with a time-dependent axiodilaton in most cases. These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nu\~nez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions. We argue that, with these generalizations, a four-dimensional Einstein-frame metric with positive Ricci scalar cannot be ruled out by such an analysis.</description>

      <title>Local Operations and Field Mediated Entanglement without a Local Tensor Product Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information has become a powerful tool for probing the structure of quantum field theories, yet its application to gauge theories remains subtle. On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on early time non-phantom behaviour of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dynamical dark energy models that allow for general late time behaviour while admitting non-phantom dynamics at early times, including thawing, scaling$+$thawing, and effective fluid extensions. Using current cosmological data, we find that the standard background parameters remain tightly constrained and stable across all models, indicating no significant impact of these dynamics on the late time expansion history. At low redshift, parametrizations with a time-dependent equation of state, particularly CPL, show a $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolution away from $w=-1$, driven by phantom-like behaviour. We then examine the observational consequences of allowing non-phantom dark energy at early times through scaling type dynamics. The data impose strong lower bounds on the steepness of the exponential potential $\gtrsim 20-30$, forcing the dark energy density to remain below the percent level around matter-radiation equality. Consequently, early dark energy is tightly constrained, and neither scaling nor tracker-type dynamics can produce a sufficiently large early dark energy component to alleviate the Hubble tension. While late time dynamical dark energy can improve the goodness of fit, the inclusion of early time scaling does not provide additional improvement and is strongly penalised by model selection criteria, leading to a disfavouring of such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of a high intensity, superthermal muonium beam for gravity and laser spectroscopy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of free fall, a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of gravity, has so far only been tested with neutral composite states of first-generation Standard Model (SM) particles, such as atoms or neutrons, and, most recently, antihydrogen. Extending these gravitational measurements to other sectors of the SM requires the formation of neutral bound states using higher-generation, unstable particles. Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($\mu^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction. However, the short $\mu^+$ lifetime ($\tau_{\mu}\approx 2.2~\mu$s) and the existing diffuse thermal muonium sources rendered such measurements unfeasible. Here, we report the synthesis of a high-brightness muonium beam, extracted from a thin layer of superfluid helium by exploiting its chemical potential and unique transport properties. The mean longitudinal velocity (${v}\approx 2180~\rm{m/s}$) and narrow distribution (${\Delta v}&lt; 150 ~\rm{m/s}$) of the atoms characterise a superthermal beam, while yields are similar to the highest intensity diffuse sources. This new beam is expected to enable muonium interferometry and a percent-level measurement of its gravitational acceleration, providing the first direct test of the Weak Equivalence Principle with second-generation (anti)matter. Its unprecedented brightness also opens the way to sub-kHz 1S-2S spectroscopy, enabling precise determination of the muon mass and stringent tests of bound-state quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stable mass transfer in massive binaries leading to merging black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of massive binary systems in the universe is evidently unsuited to produce merging binary black holes. However, several narrow evolutionary paths of isolated massive binaries towards this goal have recently been identified. Due to the high degree of simplification and assumptions applied in previous modelling of these paths, conclusions remained vague so far. For one of these paths, the stable mass transfer channel, we now construct detailed binary evolution models which include internal differential rotation as well as mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars, all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of the black holes, only skipping the rapid late burning stages. This allows us to follow the mass and chemical structure evolution of the mass accreting component, which turns out to have a key influence on the phase of reverse mass transfer, that allows the obtained black hole spins and mass ratios to naturally fall into the regime observed for the gravitational-wave source in the 10--25$M_\odot$ primary black hole mass range. As for this channel, also a large number of progenitor binaries are known, we conclude that it likely contributes to the observed population of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Parity-odd Four-Point Correlation Function from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parity-odd four-point function provides a unique probe of fundamental symmetries and potential new physics in the large-scale structure of the Universe. We present measurements of the parity-odd four-point function using the DESI DR1 LRG sample and assess its detection significance. Our analysis considers both auto- and cross-correlations, using two complementary approaches to the covariance: (i) the full analytic covariance matrix applied to the uncompressed data vector, and (ii) a compressed data vector combined with a hybrid covariance matrix constructed from simulations and analytic estimates. When using the full analytic covariance matrix without corrections, we observe apparent auto-correlation signals with significance up to $4\sigma$. However, this excess is also consistent with a mismatch between the statistical fluctuations estimated from the simulations and those present in the real data. Our findings therefore suggest that the parity-odd signal in the current DESI DR1 LRG sample is consistent with zero. We note, however, that the low completeness of this sample may have a non-negligible impact on the detection sensitivity. Future data releases with improved completeness will be crucial for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Abundance of cosmic voids in EFT of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids in the large-scale structure are among the useful probes for testing gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of voids in the Horndeski theory using the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. Modeling the void formation with the dynamics of spherical mass shells, we study how modifications of gravity encoded into the EFT of dark energy change the linearly extrapolated critical density contrast that is relevant for the criterion for void formation, with particular focus on the time-dependent parameter characterizing the effect of kinetic braiding. It is found that the change in the critical density contrast is one order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless EFT parameter because of a slight imbalance between two compensating effects. We then compute the void abundance using the Sheth--van de Weygaert void size function and demonstrate that it exhibits scale-dependent modifications. It is shown that the modifications to the void size function on small scales are almost entirely determined by the modified linear matter power spectrum, while the modifications on large scales are dominated by the contributions from the linear matter spectrum and the critical density contrast.</description>

      <title>A non-compact QCD axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of the null energy condition to variable lower bounds on the timelike Ricci curvature for $C^2$-Lorentzian metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The null energy or null convergence condition (NEC) is one of the fundamental assumptions necessary for many celebrated results from Lorentzian Geometry and Mathematical General Relativity. As such there have been several recent efforts to find a good generalization of this condition to the new setting of Lorentzian length spaces or metric measure spacetimes. One important property any such generalization should fulfill is consistency with the classical formulation for a class of spacetimes as large as possible. The purpose of this note is to show that the recent reformulation of the NEC by McCann as variable lower timelike Ricci curvature bounds (arXiv:2304.14341) remains equivalent to the classical NEC not just for smooth but even for $C^2$-metrics, where McCann's original proof needs to be modified.</description>

      <title>Supertranslation in the bulk for generic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supertranslations are usually defined as asymptotic symmetries associated with spacetime boundaries, such as null infinity and black hole horizons. In this Letter, we show that supertranslations admit a natural, coordinate-independent extension into the bulk of spacetime, realized as transitions between families of null hypersurfaces. This construction applies to generic spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions and unifies the realizations of supertranslations at null infinity and black hole horizons. The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum of Cosmological Rips and Their Observational Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified dark energy framework capable of generating a continuous spectrum of cosmological ``rip'' scenarios -- including the Big Rip, Grand Rip, Mild Rip, Little Rip, Little Sibling of the Big Rip, and the newly found Dollhouse Rip -- while ensuring a physically consistent evolution across cosmic history. Building on earlier phenomenological proposals, we introduce a barotropic equation-of-state parameter with a sigmoid-like correction to guarantee a strictly positive dark energy density and to avoid early-time pathologies commonly present in previous models. Using this formulation, closed-form analytic expressions for the energy density can be obtained. This, in turn, enables a systematic classification of future singularities based on the signs and magnitudes of two key parameters of the model. We test these scenarios with state-of-the-art cosmological probes, including DESI DR2 BAO, cosmic chronometers, CMB compressed likelihoods, and the Pantheon+ supernovae sample. According to our Bayesian analysis, all rip scenarios yield best-fit parameters compatible with $\Lambda$CDM at the $1\sigma$ level, with Bayes factors weakly favoring $\Lambda$CDM. The mild, logarithmic evolution of the proposed dark energy density prevents current observations from distinguishing among the different future fates. We conclude that, for rip cosmologies to gain observational support over $\Lambda$CDM, they must display more accentuated late-time dynamical features -- such as perhaps rapid transitions or a phantom-divide crossing -- within the redshift range probed by present surveys.</description>

      <title>From Cosmology to Cosmonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of gravity with quantum information methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to the use of quantum information methods for investigating the interface between quantum theory and gravity. To this end, we discuss the basic principles of two current research streams that use this approach. The first one explores a phenomenon known as gravitationally induced entanglement, which aims to infer whether the gravitational field responsible for the interaction between two massive bodies must be quantized or not. The second stream investigates causal structures, thereby providing indirect evidence that spacetime may exhibit non-classical behavior. Before presenting these topics, we briefly review some fundamental concepts and experiments from quantum information theory, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the Stern-Gerlach experiment, Bell inequalities and entanglement, and the language of quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The s-wave approximation to the black hole dynamics has attracted considerable attention recently. However, the near-AdS2 geometry of the near-horizon region and decoupling of the non-s-wave modes usually requires a small-temperature limit. In this work we propose the new limit based on the large number of dimensions in which the temperature remains finite, but the s-wave sector may be described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity interacting with other modes with vanishingly small coupling. However, we demonstrate that the thermal bath of the tensor modes with non-zero angular momenta collectively produces a significant impact on the two-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>A Manifestly Causal Approach to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a probability-level, manifestly causal formalism for calculations in QFT. The approach involves an implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. This inclusive summation over final states may also offer insights into the cancellation of IR divergences in physical observables within gauge theories, in accordance with the BN and KLN theorems. To study this, we first conduct particle scattering calculations using conventional methods, determining the quark-antiquark production cross section at first-order in gluon corrections, with careful tracking and cancellation of both IR and UV divergences. We then apply the causal formalism to analogous processes in scalar field theory, introducing novel diagrams that represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. We also investigate the Unruh effect through the lens of the causal formalism. We calculate the transition rate of an accelerating UdW detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial observer and an accelerating observer. We confirm that the two perspectives give the same transition rate, despite the Rindler observer describing the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of particles. Numerical results for the transition rate are presented, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state. Finally, we review the literature regarding the response of an UdW detector on various trajectories in the spacetime of a (3+1)-D Schwarzschild black hole, with a view to extending the analysis in the future using our causal formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to axions, gravitational waves (GW) can induce oscillating electromagnetic fields inside electromagnetic cavities. We explore their experimental sensitivity to monochromatic and non-monochromatic GW signals, using the total deposited energy as a primary measure. Focusing on cylindrical and spherical cavities, we present the coupling coefficients of GWs to the dominant electromagnetic resonances in transverse-traceless gauge, which is most appropriate in this regime. By considering the superposition of degenerate modes, we further examine their angular sensitivity. In addition, we calculate the response of a spherical cavity to non-monochromatic GWs emitted by primordial black hole mergers. We find that, for transient signals, a high quality factor with $Q \gtrsim 10^5$ does not necessarily enhance experimental sensitivity. In fact, even in the most optimistic scenario, only mergers within the solar system yield an observable energy deposit in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</description>

      <title>Timelike transitions in an atom by a mirror in light cone and Kruskal-Szekeres regions: a status of quantum equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the future-past light cone regions of a Minkowski spacetime, as well as in the region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the light cone regions, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a mirror is static in Minkowski spacetime while the atom is attached to a frame confined inside the future light cone region, $(ii)$ an atom is static in Minkowski spacetime, and the mirror is confined inside the future light cone region. For both situations, the atom is interacting with field modes defined in the mirror's frame. Analogous configurations are considered in the black hole spacetime: in one case, the mirror carries field modes represented by the Kruskal time, while the atom follows the Schwarzschild time defined inside the black hole; in the other case, the situations are reversed. The analyses, depending on the frame of the atom, are respectively done within the light cone, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kruskal time-interaction pictures. In all of these scenarios, we observe that the excitation probabilities contain a thermal factor and depend periodically on the separation between the atom and the mirror. At the level of transition probabilities, the aforesaid two scenarios in $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone regions appear to be the same for the equal field and atomic frequencies. However, the same is not true when we consider the $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone or the Schwarzschild interior regions. We also estimate the de-excitation probabilities and encounter similar situations. However, we observe that the excitation to de-excitation ratios (EDRs) corresponding to analogous scenarios are equal for equal atomic and field frequencies.</description>

Abstract: In the extensive literature on fluid-gravity correspondence formulated on null hypersurfaces, the Carrollian and membrane paradigm approaches have predominantly employed a timelike foliation. By contrast, within the null foliation formalism, only the momentum conservation law, expressed through the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation, has been established. In this work, we revisit the null foliation formalism for a generic null hypersurface and extend it to include the energy conservation law, continuity equation, and related relations, all derived from the covariant conservation of an appropriately defined energy-momentum tensor. This development complements the existing literature on the fluid description of gravitational dynamics in the null foliation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic Universe that can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented, extending previous results that apply in the limit of subrelativistic bulk motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the subrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in previous work. We discuss the conformal invariance of the MHD equations for a radiation-dominated fluid and different types of scaling of the fluid variables that are relevant for other equations of state when the bulk velocity is subrelativistic. In particular, we review the super-comoving coordinates that scale the time coordinate with the Universe expansion, and present a particular choice that allows the equations to become conformally flat for any choice of the equation of state. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but their detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves in the early Universe plasma. The Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\'en speeds is presented and adapted for early Universe applications. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse ``Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics'' lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program ``Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields'' at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between a one-parameter family of (anti-)de Sitter Yang-Mills models and a model of Einstein-Palatini gravity with matter, realized through In\"o\"nu-Wigner contraction of the (A)dS algebra. By setting the group parameter $\alpha$ to zero, the gauge transformation of the potential becomes consistent with the transformation properties of the tetrad form and spin connection. We show that a sector of the Yang-Mills dynamics exists in which the equations decouple. Moreover, a subset of the gauge transformations can be related to diffeomorphisms, leading to the identification of the tetrad field. Finally, the resulting dynamics is consistent with a gravitational dynamics in the first-order formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a "graviphoton") emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</description>

Abstract: We study Kerr-Schild perturbations of a ghost-free, generic non-local gravity theory constructed from an infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we obtain, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel quantum black hole model is derived by incorporating the Lorentzian term within the loop quantum cosmology framework of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model features a quantum-corrected metric tensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution. Investigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected black holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the exponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a significant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this term and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the Lorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS model and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the near-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties with both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the anti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the temperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass diminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior. Furthermore, a logarithmic term emerges as the leading-order correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Additionally, LQG corrections induce an extra phase transition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius. While for the de Sitter case, the temperature increases as the mass decreases for small black holes, again differing from classical expectations. Similarly to the anti-de Sitter case, LQG corrections in the de Sitter case also lead to an extra phase transition in the heat capacity at small radius.</description>

      <title>Expansion-sensitive coupling of a local quantum system in de Sitter cosmology</title>

Abstract: When a local quantum system couples to a quantum field in a cosmological spacetime, the time dependence of the coupling strength is conventionally taken to reflect the design of the local quantum system but not to depend on the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we consider a novel coupling that incorporates additional time dependence that reflects the cosmological expansion, as motivated by structures that appear in quantum cosmology. We focus on a conformal scalar field in a de Sitter Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with flat but compact spatial sections in 3+1 dimensions, and a comoving Unruh-DeWitt detector: the novel coupling posits the detector to couple to the scaled scalar field that appears in the conformally related static spacetime. We survey the differences between the conventional and novel coupling, for detectors that couple to the full field and detectors that couple only to specific field modes, and for detectors with proper time internal dynamics and detectors with conformal time internal dynamics. We also briefly discuss noncompact spatial sections and single-mode detectors with discontinuous time dependence. We find that the novel coupling tends to enhance the de-excitation peaks in the detector's response, particularly for single-mode detectors.</description>

      <title>Cyclic universe and uniform rate inflation in loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate uniform rate inflationary universe in the framework of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and find that this seemingly simple inflationary model is interlinked with various concepts such as cyclic evolution, HNI inflation and polymer quantized scalar fields, when the background spacetime is loop quantized. The potential for an \textit{exactly} uniform rate inflation in a loop quantized FRW spacetime turns out to be a polymerized version of the corresponding potential in general relativity, which mimics the potentials for a polymerized scalar field and that for hybrid natural inflation (HNI). There is also a radical modification of the background spacetime, leading to a cyclic universe with identical epochs separated by quantum bounces which replace the classical singularity. The energy density and Hubble rate are bounded. The predictions for cosmological perturbations depend on the value of the field at the end of inflation. The parameter space is explored to compare the results for spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio with observational constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available to the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the pair number density, the average energy per pair, and the pair energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Deflection of Massive Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Particles around Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact measurement of neutrino mass remains a longstanding issue. So far, there has been much success in providing an upper bound for the neutrino rest mass, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, by exploring the critical radius of a beam of polarized quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle deflecting around a classical Kerr black hole, we attempt to provide an additional testing ground for neutrino mass, as well as the mass of other proposed ultra-light particles yet to be determined. Notably, the quantum Dirac equation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam of massive spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the spin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous theoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles' intrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative magnitude $&gt;10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with rest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole. Although highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the neutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum spin correction.</description>

      <title>The Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality for asymptotically flat, axisymmetric initial data satisfying the dominant energy condition with vacuum in the exterior region. This inequality establishes a lower bound for the total mass (ADM mass) in terms of the area and angular momentum of an outermost strictly stable marginally outer trapped surface. Equality holds if and only if the data arises from a slice of the Kerr spacetime.
  The proof introduces a four-stage method combining the Jang equation, conformal deformations, and Inverse Mean Curvature Flow techniques. The key innovation is the introduction of an angular-momentum-modified Hawking mass, which is shown to be monotonically non-decreasing along the flow and converges to the ADM mass at infinity.
  As a methodological application, we also outline a new proof strategy for the Charged Penrose Inequality for non-rotating Einstein-Maxwell data, demonstrating the versatility of this framework.</description>

      <title>Novel thermodynamic inequality for rotating AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new thermodynamic inequality for stationary and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black holes, $ 4\pi J^2/(3MV)&lt;1 $. This inequality is derived through an analysis of the roots of the identity which holds among the thermodynamic variables to avoid a naked singularity. We have analyzed the Kerr-AdS black hole and the asymptotically AdS uncharged and rotating black strings and find strong supporting evidence for different horizon topologies. Using this inequality we verify the validity of reverse isoperimetric inequality in its conventional form ($ {\cal R}\geq 1 $) in the presence of rotation. By examining a wide range of black hole solutions, we confirm the validity of the proposed inequality. Assuming that reverse isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in higher dimensions, and employing the intermediate refined reverse isoperimetric inequalities introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 241401] as guiding principles, we extend the inequality to higher-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Two-point correlators in de Sitter-prepared states with bra-ket wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how "bra-ket wormholes" modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining 'time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find late-time transitions in the dominant saddle, accompanied by the ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and the characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Each observable is consistent with `complementarity', in the sense that wormhole effects are distinguishable only at late respective times. Consistencies are based upon the interplay of (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlations at small comoving momentum by wormhole contributions, (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance, which naturally yields the fast scrambling timescale, and (iv) irreducible errors by cosmic variance in early CMB-like observations. To clearly interpret in terms of entropy and chaotic nature of dS, one needs a more complete mechanism of wormhole stabilization.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the spin/anisotropy of the CCOs of Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 and a single surviving continuous gravitational wave candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out the deepest and broadest search for continuous gravitational-wave signals with frequencies between 20-1500 Hz, from three neutron stars at the center of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A, Vela Jr., and G347.3-0.5. This search was made possible by the computing power shared by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. After the initial Einstein@Home search, we perform a multi-stage follow-up of the most promising $\approx$ 45 million signal candidates. In the last stages, we use independent data to further investigate the remaining candidates from the previous stages. We set the most stringent constraints to date on the gravitational-wave amplitude, equatorial ellipticity, r-mode saturation amplitude, and -- for the first time -- the neutron-star crustal anisotropy. For spin periods lower than 2 ms we constrain the ellipticity to be smaller than $4\times 10^{-7}$ for all targets. We exclude the crustal anisotropy to be smaller than $5\times 10^{-3}$ for spin periods between 1.3-100 ms. Only one candidate -- from the low frequency G347.3 search -- survives all follow-ups. We illustrate properties of this candidate. Investigations on new data will aid in clarifying its nature. Such ``new" data exists and would be optimal for this purpose, but they are not publicly accessible at the time of writing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Shadow of regularized compact objects without a photon sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) indicate that the shadow of the compact object at our Galaxy's center (Sgr A*) closely resembles that of a Schwarzschild black hole. However, identifying the presence and exact location of a photon sphere observationally remains challenging. Motivated by this, we investigate shadow formation in spacetimes that lack a photon sphere by applying the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization technique (originally designed to smooth black hole singularities) to null singularity and charged null singularity metrics. Remarkably, these regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can produce a shadow without a photon sphere. We analyze how the SV regularization parameter influences their geometry and shadow size, and show that the regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can correspond either to two-way traversable wormholes or retain singularities. Our results reveal that shadows arising from these regularized 'null singularity spacetimes' closely mimic those of Schwarzschild and charged black-bounce spacetimes, despite the absence of a photon sphere. We also constrain parameters in these geometries using observational data of Sgr A* and M87.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crossed product has recently emerged as an important ingredient in describing algebras of observables for quantum field theory and gravity. We combine this with perturbation theory, and study perturbative crossed product algebras obtained from a unitary deformation of the original system. Motivated by the problem of black hole evaporation, we propose an abstract framework in which black hole information can be transferred to Hawking radiation by passing to a perturbative crossed product exhibiting a degree of non-locality in its modular structure. As both a concrete example and a toy model for evaporation, we analyze the algebra of observables of the traversable wormhole in anti-de-Sitter space. We obtain new contributions to the generalized entropy beyond subleading order relative to the original work by Gao, Jafferis, and Wall. We close with some comments on the potential applicability of the algebraic approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model. Note that these bounds on $\alpha$ and $r$ are derived within the linear framework of tensor fluctuations at the level of equations of motion, which nevertheless include scalar-scalar-tensor interactions with metric and matter fields. However, fully non-linear approaches, with all higher-order metric fluctuations, would be needed in the future to further validate these conclusions.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. To this end, we apply Souriau's Principle of General Covariance, which is a geometrical framework to derive diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) on Finsler geometries, and we give their conserved quantities which turn out to be formally identical to the Riemannian case.
  These equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since the velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the momentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the complete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to previously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4 dimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational currents and charges from conformal Killing-Yano tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a set of higher-form conserved currents on spacetimes admitting conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We find relations between these currents that allow the charge given by integrating one of these currents over a region to be re-expressed as an integral of a covariant quantity over the boundary. In many cases, only a non-covariant form of the boundary integral was previously known. For a special class of these currents the conservation does not rely on field equations, so they give conserved topological charges in any gravitational theory. We discuss the relation of our currents to the Komar current and derive several new properties of conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We study a number of applications of our construction to charges of black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory, and D-brane solutions of type II supergravity.</description>

      <title>A measure on the space of CFTs and pure 3D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a normalizable measure on the space of two-dimensional conformal field theories, which we interpret as a maximum ignorance ensemble. We test whether pure quantum gravity in AdS$_3$ is dual to the average over this ensemble. We find a negative answer, which implies that CFTs with a primary gap of order the central charge are highly atypical in our ensemble. We provide evidence that more generally, holographic CFTs are atypical in the space of all CFTs by finding similar results for permutation orbifolds: subgroups of $S_N$ with a good large $N$ limit are very sparse in the space of all subgroups. Along the way, we derive several new results on the space of CFTs. Notably we derive an upper bound on the spacing in central charge between CFTs, which is doubly exponentially small in the large central charge limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Primordial Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations. Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.</description>
