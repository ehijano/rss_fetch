      <title>A Simple Model to Estimate Sharing Effects in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for estimating treatment effects across many fields of science. Technology companies have adopted A/B-testing methods as a modern RCT counterpart, where end-users are randomly assigned various system variants and user behaviour is tracked continuously. The objective is then to estimate the causal effect that the treatment variant would have on certain metrics of interest to the business.
  When the outcomes for randomisation units -- end-users in this case -- are not statistically independent, this obfuscates identifiability of treatment effects, and harms decision-makers' observability of the system. Social networks exemplify this, as they are designed to promote inter-user interactions. This interference by design notoriously complicates measurement of, e.g., the effects of sharing. In this work, we propose a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based model describing user sharing behaviour in social networks. We derive an unbiased estimator for treatment effects under this model, and demonstrate through reproducible synthetic experiments that it outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Post-disaster Recovery in Behavior-dependent Business Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recovery of businesses after a disaster is vital to community economic resilience, yet the network dynamics influencing the speed and spillover effects of recovery remain poorly understood. Understanding these dynamics is essential for characterizing economic resilience and informing more effective recovery policies. This study explores the extent to which post-disaster business recovery is shaped by network diffusion processes within pre-disaster business dependency networks, driven by visitation behaviors among business points of interest (POIs). We developed a network diffusion model to simulate recovery across businesses in the Louisiana Gulf Coast following Hurricane Ida (2021) and assessed its performance using empirical data. Our analysis focuses on four key areas: (1) the presence of a diffusion process influencing recovery across the business network; (2) variations in how different business types depend on others for recovery; (3) identification of recovery multiplier businesses that accelerate regional recovery; and (4) differences in recovery multipliers across high- and low-income areas. The findings reveal that business recovery is governed by diffusion dynamics in these behavior-based networks, with recovery speed closely linked to pre-disaster visitation patterns. Retail and service businesses are identified as key recovery multipliers whose rapid recovery accelerates the broader business network's recovery, enhancing economic resilience. Additionally, recovery multipliers vary between high- and low-income areas. This study enhances our understanding of network mechanisms in post-disaster recovery and offers valuable insights for improving recovery policies.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on ADHD Research: Knowledge Graph Construction with LLMs and Network Based Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a challenging disorder to study due to its complex symptomatology and diverse contributing factors. To explore how we can gain deeper insights on this topic, we performed a network analysis on a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) of ADHD, constructed by integrating scientific literature and clinical data with the help of cutting-edge large language models. The analysis, including k-core techniques, identified critical nodes and relationships that are central to understanding the disorder. Building on these findings, we developed a context-aware chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling accurate and informed interactions. Our knowledge graph not only advances the understanding of ADHD but also provides a powerful tool for research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting LGBTQ+ Instances of Cyberbullying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media continues to have an impact on the trajectory of humanity. However, its introduction has also weaponized keyboards, allowing the abusive language normally reserved for in-person bullying to jump onto the screen, i.e., cyberbullying. Cyberbullying poses a significant threat to adolescents globally, affecting the mental health and well-being of many. A group that is particularly at risk is the LGBTQ+ community, as researchers have uncovered a strong correlation between identifying as LGBTQ+ and suffering from greater online harassment. Therefore, it is critical to develop machine learning models that can accurately discern cyberbullying incidents as they happen to LGBTQ+ members. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of several transformer models in identifying cyberbullying targeting LGBTQ+ individuals. We seek to determine the relative merits and demerits of these existing methods in addressing complex and subtle kinds of cyberbullying by assessing their effectiveness with real social media data.</description>

      <title>Spatially-invariant opinion dynamics on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear opinion dynamics model for an agent making decisions about a continuous distribution of options in the presence of distributed input. Inspired by perceptual decision-making, we develop the theory for options distributed on the circle, representing, e.g., the set of possible heading directions in planar robotic navigation problems. Interactions among options are encoded through a spatially invariant kernel. We design the kernel to ensure that decision-making is robust, in the sense that only a finite subset of options can be favored over the continuum. We prove the spatial invariance of the model linearization and use this result to prove an opinion-forming bifurcation in the model with zero input. We then use space and time frequency domain analysis of the model linearization to infer the ultra-sensitive input-output behavior of the nonlinear dynamics with input. We illustrate our model's versatility with a robotic navigation example in crowded spaces.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the public transport network against attacks on its routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Public Transport Networks (PTNs) when subjected to route attacks, focusing specifically on public bus lines. Such attacks, mirroring real-world scenarios, offer insight into the multifaceted dynamics of cities. Our study delves into the consequences of systematically removing entire routes based on strategies that use centrality measures. We evaluate the network's robustness by analyzing the sizes of fragmented networks, focusing on the largest components and derived metrics. To assess the efficacy of various attack strategies, we employ them on both a synthetic PTN model and a real-world example, specifically the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area in Argentina. We examine these strategies and contrast them with random, and one-step most and least harmful procedures. Our findings indicate that \textit{betweenness}-based attacks and the one-step most (\textit{maximal}) harmful procedure emerge as the most effective attack strategies. Remarkably, the \textit{betweenness} strategy partitions the network into components of similar sizes, whereas alternative approaches yield one dominant and several minor components.</description>

      <title>Exploring individual differences through network topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.13672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social animals, including humans, have a broad range of personality traits, which can be used to predict individual behavioral responses and decisions. Current methods to quantify individual personality traits in humans rely on self-report questionnaires, which require time and effort to collect, and rely on active cooperation. However, personality differences naturally manifest in social interactions such as online social networks. Here, we explored this option and found that the topology of an online social network can be used to characterize the personality traits of its members. We analyzed the directed social graph formed by the users of the LiveJournal (LJ) blogging platform. Individual user personality traits, inferred from their self-reported domains of interest (DOIs), were associated with their network measures. Empirical clustering of DOIs by topological similarity exposed two main self-emergent DOI groups that were in alignment with the personality meta-traits plasticity and stability. Closeness, a global topological measure of network centrality, was higher for bloggers associated with plasticity (vs. stability). A local network motif (a triad of 3 connected bloggers) also separated the personality meta-traits. Finally, topology-based classification of DOIs (without analyzing the blog content) attained &gt; 70% accuracy (average AUC of the test-set). These results indicate that personality traits can be detected in social network topology. This has serious implications for user privacy. But, if used responsibly, network identification of personality traits could aid in early identification of health-related risks, at the population level.</description>

      <title>Centrality-Based Node Feature Augmentation for Robust Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12751v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Self-attention Dual Embedding for Graphs with Heterophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been highly successful for the node classification task. GNNs typically assume graphs are homophilic, i.e. neighboring nodes are likely to belong to the same class. However, a number of real-world graphs are heterophilic, and this leads to much lower classification accuracy using standard GNNs. In this work, we design a novel GNN which is effective for both heterophilic and homophilic graphs. Our work is based on three main observations. First, we show that node features and graph topology provide different amounts of informativeness in different graphs, and therefore they should be encoded independently and prioritized in an adaptive manner. Second, we show that allowing negative attention weights when propagating graph topology information improves accuracy. Finally, we show that asymmetric attention weights between nodes are helpful. We design a GNN which makes use of these observations through a novel self-attention mechanism. We evaluate our algorithm on real-world graphs containing thousands to millions of nodes and show that we achieve state-of-the-art results compared to existing GNNs. We also analyze the effectiveness of the main components of our design on different graphs.</description>

      <title>The complementary contributions of academia and industry to AI research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen fast paced development in industry and academia. However, striking recent advances by industry have stunned the field, inviting a fresh perspective on the role of academic research on this progress. Here, we characterize the impact and type of AI produced by both environments over the last 25 years and establish several patterns. We find that articles published by teams consisting exclusively of industry researchers tend to get greater attention, with a higher chance of being highly cited and citation-disruptive, and several times more likely to produce state-of-the-art models. In contrast, we find that exclusively academic teams publish the bulk of AI research and tend to produce higher novelty work, with single papers having several times higher likelihood of being unconventional and atypical. The respective impact-novelty advantages of industry and academia are robust to controls for subfield, team size, seniority, and prestige. We find that academic-industry collaborations produce the most impactful work overall but do not have the novelty level of academic teams. Together, our findings identify the unique and nearly irreplaceable contributions that both academia and industry make toward the progress of AI.</description>

      <title>Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</description>

      <title>Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient multilingual candidate retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.</description>
