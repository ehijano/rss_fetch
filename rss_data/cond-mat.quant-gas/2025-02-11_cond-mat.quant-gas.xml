      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Coherent Quantum Tunneling of a Massive Atomic Cluster with 435 u</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling is a genuine quantum phenomenon typically observed in low-mass particles such as electrons. However, it fades rapidly as mass increases due to the exponential decay of the matter-wave penetration depth. Cooling atoms to nanokelvin temperatures enhances their matter wave characteristics. Here, we report the observation of coherent quantum tunneling of a bonded cluster composed of 5 ultracold rubidium-87 atoms, collectively forming a massive object of 435 u. Using a double-well superlattice, integer occupancy states are prepared, with atoms bonded via strong on-site interactions. We demonstrate that the exponential base of tunneling strength can be tuned to approach unity, drastically reducing its decay for heavier masses and enabling a scalable strategy. Moreover, tunneling is harnessed to create spatially separated Schr\"{o}dinger-cat states (~320 nm apart), achieving quantum enhancement in measurements. This work markedly raises the mass threshold for quantum tunneling and paves the way for quantum metrology with massive particles.</description>

      <title>Chiral Raman coupling for spin-orbit coupling in ultracold atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in ultracold atoms is engineered by light-atom interaction, such as two-photon Raman transitions between two Zeeman spin states. In this work, we propose and experimentally realize chiral Raman coupling to generate SOC in ultracold atomic gases, which exhibits high quantization axis direction-dependence. Chiral Raman coupling for SOC is created by chiral light-atom interaction, in which a circularly polarized electromagnetic field generated by two Raman lasers interacts with two Zeeman spin states $\delta m_{F}=\pm 1$ (chiral transition). We present a simple scheme of chiral one-dimension (1D) Raman coupling by employing two Raman lasers at an intersecting angle 90$^{\circ}$ with the proper polarization configuration. In this case, Raman coupling for SOC exist in one direction of the magnetic quantization axis and disappears in the opposite direction. Then we extend this scheme into a chiral 2D optical square Raman lattice configuration to generate the 1D SOC. There are two orthogonal 1D SOC, which exists in the positive and negative directions of the magnetic quantization axis respectively. This case is compared with 2D SOC based on the nonchiral 2D optical Raman lattice scheme for studying the topological energy band. This work broadens the horizon for understanding chiral physics and simulating topological quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fermion mediated pairing in the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida to Efimov transition regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction and Efimov physics are two distinct quantum phenomena in condensed matter and nuclear physics, respectively. The RKKY interaction describes correlations between impurities mediated by an electron gas, while Efimov physics describes universal bound states of three particles with resonant interactions. Recently, both effects have been observed in Bose-Fermi mixtures in the weak and resonant interaction regimes, respectively. Intriguing conjectures exist to elucidate how the two phenomena meet in the transition regime where the mixture is strongly interacting. In this work, we explore the RKKY-Efimov transition in a mixture of bosonic Cs-133 and fermionic Li-6 near a tunable interspecies Feshbach resonance. From dispersion and relaxation measurements, we find that the transition is highlighted by a fermion-mediated scattering resonance between Cs atoms and a weaker resonance on Li atoms. These resonances represent reactive scattering of Cs and Li atoms in the many-body regime, which reduces to an Efimov resonance in the thermal gas regime. Our observation demonstrates the intriguing interplay of two-, three-, and many-body physics in an Bose-Fermi mixture that connects condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and quantum many-body chemistry.</description>

      <title>Transport of ultracold dipolar fermions in one-dimensional optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties in out-of-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated dipolar fermions initially localized in one-dimensional inhomogeneous optical lattice. The dynamics is studied by experimentally measurable dynamical variables such as one-body density, pair-correlation function and size of the expanding cloud. In the noninteracting limit, we trace the usual fingerprints of ballistic expansion in the short time dynamics. However, dynamics is strongly affected by system size due to Pauli principle. The dynamics also exhibits significant dependence on the sign of the interactions. We observe that strong repulsive dipolar interaction gives rise to many-body features in the dynamics, while strong attractive dipolar interaction leads to stabilized cluster states. Intermediate dipolar interaction are found to hinder expansion of correlations, while very strong dipolar interaction favors expansion of the cloud. Our work show the effect of dipolar interaction in the transport properties of interacting fermions, that can be studied in on-going experiments with ultracold dipolar fermions.</description>

      <title>Emulating Novel Topological Phases with Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a feasible scheme utilizing the Floquet engineering platform with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to emulate both pair-hopping processes and singlet/triplet pairing interactions, aiming to simulate and control novel topologically nontrivial phases. Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.</description>

      <title>Supersolid phases of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolids--the enigmatic phase of quantum matter, with properties resembling both the superfluid and solid states--have been actively sought over the past 70 years. We provide a comprehensive review of the to-date development in experimental and theoretical studies of supersolid bosons, with a particular focus on their observation in ultracold atomic gases. Additionally, the use of optical lattice facilitates the realization of 'lattice-supersolids', which paves the way to study the effect of correlations in a controlled manner. A brief theoretical framework is presented to characterize this puzzling state with competing orders and to gain insight into its basic properties. Various types of supersolid phases and the different platforms used to achieve them are described. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of research and the potential to achieve supersolids with more exotic features.</description>

Abstract: We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Observation of Magnon-Polarons in the Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold triatomic molecules by electric microwave association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical model is proposed for the formation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules in weakly bound energy levels. The process is driven by the electric component of a microwave field, which induces the association of an ultracold atom colliding with an ultracold diatomic molecule. This model is exemplified using $^{39}$K atoms and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules, both in their ground states, a scenario of experimental relevance. The model assumes that the dynamics of the association are dominated by the long-range van der Waals interaction between $^{39}$K and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K. The electric microwave association mechanism relies on the intrinsic electric dipole moment of $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K, which drives transitions between its lowest rotational levels ( $j$=0 and $j$=1). The energies of the uppermost triatomic energy levels are computed by numerically solving coupled Schr\"odinger equations using the Mapped Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method. Measurable association rates are derived within the framework of a perturbative approach. This method of electric microwave association provides an alternative to atom-molecule association via magnetic Feshbach resonances for forming ultracold, deeply bound triatomic molecules, and is applicable to a wide range of polar diatomic molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the diffusive spin dynamics of a 2D electron gas with spin-orbit coupling confined within a grid of narrow channels. We show that the lifetime of certain spin distributions in such grids greatly exceeds that in an unconfined 2D electron gas and diverges as the channel width approaches zero. Such persistent spin grids occur if the electron spin orientation remains invariant after diffusion around the grid plaquette. We establish a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification for persistent spin grids and speculate that the setup can be used to simulate non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinant quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Many-body density of states of bosonic and fermionic gases: a combinatorial approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a combinatorial approach to obtain exact expressions for the many-body density of states of fermionic and bosonic gases with equally spaced single-particle spectra. We identify a mapping that reveals a remarkable property, namely, fermionic and bosonic gases have the same many-body density of states, up to a shift corresponding to ground state energy. Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems</title>

Abstract: We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>

Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the preparation of topological insulator states with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices by means of measurement-based Markovian feedback control. The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</description>

Abstract: We present recent results in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at finite isospin $\mu_I$ and strangeness $\mu_s$ chemical potentials at zero temperature. The phase diagram to ${\cal O}(p^2)$ in the $\mu_I$--$\mu_S$ plane is mapped out with and without electromagnetic effects. The phase diagram consists of a vacuum phase and three Bose-condensed phases with condensates of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^{0}/\bar{K}^0$, respectively. Including electromagnetic interactions, the Bose-condensed phases become Higgs phases via the Higgs mechanism. The tree-level spectrum for the mesons and gauge bosons is also derived. We calculate the pressure, energy density, isospin density, and speed of sound in the pion-condensed phase to ${\cal O}(p^4)$ for three-flavor $\chi$PT. The results are compared with recent lattice simulations and the agreement is very good for isospin chemical potentials up to approximately 200 MeV. Moreover, by integrating out the $s$-quark, we show that the thermodynamic quantities can be mapped onto their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized parameters. %to ${\cal O}(p^6)$ for two-flavor $\chi$PT in the chiral limit. We also consider the nonrelativistic limit. It is shown that the energy density can be matched onto the classic result by Lee, Huang and Yang (LHY) for a dilute Bose, with an $s$-wave scattering length that includes radiative corrections. The breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry in the Bose-condensed phases gives rise to a Goldstone bosons, whose dispersion is linear for momenta $p\ll\mu_I$. In this regime, we use Son's prescription to construct an effective theory for the Goldstone field which is valid in this regime. It is shown that its damping rate is of order $p^5$. This result is in agreement with Beliav's for a dilute Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>
