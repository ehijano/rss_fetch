      <title>A metal-poor atmosphere with a hot interior for a young sub-Neptune progenitor: JWST/NIRSpec transmission spectrum of V1298 Tau b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of the young (10 - 20 Myr old) transiting planet V1298 Tau b (9.85+/-0.35 Re, Teq=670K). Combined HST and JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a large scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30 sigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our observations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in the 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale height using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me respectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity estimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an atmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low compared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance ([CH4]=-6.1^+0.2_-0.3) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction. To adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a high internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s). These internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary models, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a gas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me, consistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity gradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable metallicity. Over time, mass loss from such an atmosphere could enhance its metallicity, potentially reconciling V1298 Tau b with mature sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Where are the missing Kuiper Belt binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we call attention to a gap in binaries in the Kuiper belt in the mass range between $\approx$10$^{19}$-10$^{20}$ kg, with a corresponding dearth in binaries between 4th and 5th absolute magnitude $H$. The low-mass end of the gap is consistent with the truncation of the cold classical population at 400 km, as suggested by the OSSOS survey, and predicted by simulations of planetesimal formation by streaming instability. The distribution of magnitudes for all KBOs is continuous, which means that many objects exist in the gap, but the binaries in this range have either been disrupted, or the companions are too close to the primary and/or too dim to be detected with the current generation of observational instruments. At the high-mass side of the gap, the objects have small satellites at small separations, and we find a trend that as mass decreases, the ratio of primary radius to secondary semimajor increases. If this trend continues into the gap, non-Keplerian effects should make mass determination more challenging.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI observations of the young TWA 27 system: hydrocarbon disk chemistry, silicate clouds, evidence for a CPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) enables the characterisation of young self-luminous gas giants at previously inaccessible wavelengths, revealing physical processes in gas, dust, and clouds. We characterise the young planetary system TWA 27 (2M1207) in the mid-infrared (MIR), studying the atmosphere and disk spectra of the M9 brown dwarf TWA 27A and its L6 planetary-mass companion TWA 27b. We obtained data with the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 20 um, and MIRI Imaging in the F1000W and F1500W filters. We applied high-contrast imaging methods to extract the companion's spectral energy distribution up to 15 um at 0.78 arcsec separation and a contrast of 60. Combining these with published JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we analysed the 1-20 um range using self-consistent atmospheric grids and 0D slab models for molecular disk emission. The atmosphere of TWA 27A is well fitted by a BT-SETTL model with Teff 2780 K, log g 4.3, plus a 740 K blackbody for the inner disk rim. The disk shows at least 11 organic molecules, with no water or silicate dust emission detected. The atmosphere of TWA 27b is matched by a Teff 1400 K low-gravity model with extinction, best fit by the ExoREM grid. MIRI spectra and photometry for TWA 27b reveal a silicate cloud absorption feature between 8-10 um and significant (&gt;5 sigma) infrared excess at 15 um consistent with circumplanetary disk emission. These MIRI observations provide new insights into TWA 27, revealing diverse features to study the formation and evolution of circumplanetary disks and young dusty atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Free Floating or Merely Detached?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing surveys suggest the presence of a surprisingly large population of free-floating planets, with a rate of about two Neptunes per star. The origin of such objects is not known, neither do we know if they are truly unbound or are merely orbiting at large separations from their host stars. Here, we investigate planet-planet scattering as a possible origin through numerical simulations of unstable multi-planet systems. We find that planet ejection by scattering can be slow, often taking more than billions of years for Neptune-mass scatterers orbiting at a few AU and beyond. Moreover, this process invariably delivers planets to orbits of hundreds of AU that are protected from further scattering. We call these ``detached" planets. Under the scattering hypothesis, we estimate that about half of the reported ``free-floating" Neptunes are not free but merely ``detached".</description>

      <title>From Global Climate Models (GCMs) to Exoplanet Spectra with the Global Emission Spectra (GlobES)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest to understand the climates and atmospheres of exoplanets, 3D global climate models (GCMs) have become indispensable. The ability of GCMs to predict atmospheric conditions complements exoplanet observations, creating a feedback loop that enhances our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres and their environments. This paper discusses the capabilities of the Global Exoplanet Spectra (GlobES) module of the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG), which incorporates 3D atmospheric and surface information into spectral simulations, offering a free, accessible tool for the scientific community to study realistic planetary atmospheres. Through detailed case studies, including simulations of TRAPPIST1 b, TRAPPIST-1 e, and Earth around Sun, this paper demonstrates the use of GlobES and its effectiveness in simulating transit, emission and reflected spectra, thus supporting the ongoing development and refinement of observational strategies using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future mission concept studies (e.g., Habitable Worlds Observatory [HWO]) in exoplanet research.</description>

      <title>Detailed Architecture of the L 98-59 System and Confirmation of a Fifth Planet in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L 98-59 system, identified by TESS in 2019, features three transiting exoplanets in compact orbits of 2.253, 3.691, and 7.451 days around an M3V star, with an outer 12.83-day non-transiting planet confirmed in 2021 using ESPRESSO. The planets exhibit a diverse range of sizes (0.8-1.6 R$_{\oplus}$), masses (0.5-3 M$_{\oplus}$), and likely compositions (Earth-like to possibly water-rich), prompting atmospheric characterization studies with HST and JWST. Here, we analyze 16 new TESS sectors and improve radial velocity (RV) precision of archival ESPRESSO and HARPS data using a line-by-line framework, enabling stellar activity detrending via a novel differential temperature indicator. We refine the radii of L 98-59 b, c, and d to 0.837 $\pm$ 0.019 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.329 $\pm$ 0.029 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.627 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_{\oplus}$, respectively. Combining RVs with transit timing variations (TTV) of L 98-59 c and d from TESS and JWST provides unprecedented constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We report updated masses of 0.46 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\oplus}$ for b, 2.00 $\pm$ 0.13 M$_{\oplus}$ for c, and 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 M$_{\oplus}$ for d, and a minimum mass of 2.82 $\pm$ 0.19 M$_{\oplus}$ for e. We additionally confirm L 98-59\,f, a non-transiting super-Earth with a minimal mass of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\oplus}$ on a 23.06-day orbit inside the Habitable Zone. The TTVs of L 98-59 c and d (&lt;3 min, $P_{\rm TTV} = 396$ days) constrain the eccentricities of all planets to near-circular orbits ($e \lesssim 0.04$). An internal structure analysis of the transiting planets reveals increasing water-mass fractions ($f_{\rm H_{2}O}$) with orbital distance, reaching $f_{\rm H_{2}O} \approx 0.16$ for L 98-59\ d. We predict eccentricity-induced tidal heating in L 98-59 b with heat fluxes comparable to those of Io, potentially driving volcanic activity.</description>

      <title>Leaky dust trap in the PDS 70 disk revealed by ALMA Band 9 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new observations of the PDS 70 disc obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 9 (671 GHz) at 0.242$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, which provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of sub-millimetre grains in the disc. The data reveal a ring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously observed at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations. Additionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not observed at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\sim 100 \mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both radially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than those probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at millimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution shows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the dust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain size in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains as small as 10 $\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters through the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a turbulent viscosity of $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter through the disc gap, while $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ is required to retain large grains in the pressure bump. The Band 9 observations of PDS 70 validate theoretical models and confirm the presence of pebble flux through the disc gap.</description>

      <title>A New Brown Dwarf Orbiting an M star and An Investigation on the Eccentricity Distribution of Transiting Long-Period Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital eccentricities of brown dwarfs encode valuable information of their formation and evolution history, providing insights into whether they resemble giant planets or stellar binaries. Here, we report the discovery of TOI-5575b, a long-period, massive brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass M5V star ($\rm 0.21\pm0.02\,M_\odot$) delivered by the TESS mission. The companion has a mass and radius of $\rm 72.4\pm4.1\,M_J$ and $\rm 0.84\pm0.07\,R_J$ on a 32-day moderately eccentric orbit ($e=0.187\pm0.002$), making it the third highest-mass-ratio transiting brown dwarf system known to date. Building on this discovery, we investigate the eccentricity distributions of a sample of transiting long-period ($10\leq P\lesssim 1000$ days, $\sim$0.1-1.5 AU) giant planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We find that brown dwarfs exhibit an eccentricity behavior nearly identical to that of giant planets: a preference for circular orbits with a long tail toward high eccentricities. Such a trend contrasts sharply with direct imaging findings, where cold (5-100 AU) brown dwarfs and giant planets display distinct eccentricity distributions. Our results suggest that transiting long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets probably 1) form in different routes at exterior orbits but undergo analogous dynamical evolution processes and migrate inwards; or 2) both contain two sub-groups, one with widely spread eccentricities while the other has circular orbits, that jointly sculpt the eccentricity distributions. The low-mass-star systems appear to be a distinctive population, showing a peak eccentricity at about 0.3, akin to more massive stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>The New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS) VIII. Impact of host star metallicity on planet occurrence rates, orbital periods, eccentricities, and radius valley morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dust-to-gas ratio in the protoplanetary disk, which is likely imprinted into the host star metallicity, is a property that plays a crucial role during planet formation. We aim at constraining planet formation and evolution processes by statistically analysing planetary systems generated by the Generation III Bern model, comparing with the correlations derived from observational samples. Using synthetic planets biased to observational completeness, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and Neptune-size planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small sub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, for sub-Neptune and super-Earth, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with increasing [Fe/H] with an inflection point at 0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital periods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with higher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius. (3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between the eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation and perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and becomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the planets above the valley increases with [Fe/H]. Our nominal model successfully reproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity, supporting the description of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model. However, the dependences of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted by the synthetic population is however significantly weaker than observed. This discrepancy suggests that long-term dynamical interactions between planets, along with the impact of binaries/companions, can drive the system towards a dynamically hotter state.</description>

      <title>Cometary ion dynamics at 67P: A collisional test-particle approach with Rosetta data comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rosetta spacecraft escorted comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for two years, gathering a rich and variable dataset. Amongst the data from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) suite of instruments are measurements of the total electron density from the Mutual Impedance Probe (MIP) and Langmuir Probe (LAP).
  At low outgassing, the plasma density measurements can be explained by a simple balance between the production through ionisation and loss through transport. Ions are assumed to travel radially at the outflow speed of the neutral gas. Near perihelion, the assumptions of this field-free chemistry-free model are no longer valid, and plasma density is overestimated. This can be explained by enhanced ion transport by an ambipolar electric field inside the diamagnetic cavity, where the interplanetary magnetic field does not reach.
  In this study, we explore the transition between these two regimes, at intermediate outgassing ($5.4 \times10^{26}~\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), when the interaction between the cometary and solar wind plasma influences the transport of the ions. We use a 3D collisional test-particle model, adapted from Stephenson et al. 2022 to model the cometary ions with input electric and magnetic fields from a hybrid simulation for 2.5-3 au. The total plasma density from this model is then compared to data from MIP/LAP and to the field-free chemistry-free model. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of the hybrid approach and demonstrate the importance of modelling collisional cooling of the electrons to understand the ion dynamics close to the nucleus.</description>

      <title>The Pedersen and Hall Conductances in the Jovian Polar Regions: New Maps based on a Broadband Electron Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances play an important role in understanding the exchanges of angular momentum, energy and matter between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere at Jupiter, modifying the composition and temperature of the planet. In the high latitude regions, these conductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of a broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed electron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values is investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous studies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband precipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution, which is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the density vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the Pedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the conductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally, the Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the corresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances are globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution rather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct outputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression presented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron collision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance values. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation enforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the field-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere are also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned currents.</description>

      <title>Modeling Atmospheric Alteration on Titan: Hydrodynamics and Shock-Induced Chemistry of Meteoroid Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteoroid entry into planetary atmospheres generates bow shocks, resulting in high-temperature gas conditions that drive chemical reactions. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of meteoroid entry using the Athena++ code, coupled with chemistry calculations via Cantera to model the non-equilibrium chemistry triggered by atmospheric entry. Our aerodynamical simulations reveal the formation of complex shock structures, including secondary shock waves, which influence the thermodynamic evolution of the gas medium. By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the effects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction pathways. Our results demonstrate that chemical quenching occurs when the cooling timescale surpasses reaction rates, leading to the formation of distinct chemical products that deviate from equilibrium predictions. We show that the efficiency of molecular synthesis depends on the object\textquotesingle s size and velocity, influencing the composition of the post-entry gas mixture. Applying our model to Titan, we demonstrate that organic matter can be synthesized in the present environment of Titan. Also, we find that nitrogen, the dominant atmospheric component, remains stable, while water vapor is efficiently removed, a result inconsistent with equilibrium chemistry assumptions. Moreover, we compare our simulation results with laser experiments and find good agreement in chemical yields. Finally, we also evaluate the impact on Titan\textquotesingle s atmosphere as a whole, showing that meteoroid entry events could have played a significant role in supplying molecules such as HCN during early Titan\textquotesingle s history.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Acoustic Signatures of Saturn's Upper Atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions for the acoustic attenuation coefficient and phase speed as functions of frequency and altitude in Saturn's atmosphere are presented and discussed. The pressure range considered in the study is 1 mbar to 1 bar, in windless and cloudless conditions. The atmospheric composition is represented by the major constituents, namely hydrogen (with its two spin isomers, ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$) and helium. The H$_2$ and He concentrations are assumed constant with respect to altitude; however, non-uniform ortho- and para-H$_2$ profiles are considered. The acoustic wavenumber is obtained by incorporating a viscous, thermal, and internal molecular relaxation effects in a linearized fluid dynamics model. The ambient inputs are vertical profiles of the specific heats, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity coefficients of the three-component (oH$_2$, pH$_2$, He) mixture, extracted at each pressure-temperature pair.

      <title>Multi-epoch spectro-photometric characterization of the minimoon 2024 PT$_5$ in the visible and near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2024 PT$_5$ is a tiny ($D\leq10$ m) near-Earth asteroid (NEA) discovered in August 2024. 2024 PT$_5$ was gravitationally bound to the Earth-Moon system from September to November 2024 and classified as a minimoon. Several quick response observations suggest the lunar ejecta origin of 2024 PT$_5$, while rotation state and albedo, essential properties to investigate its origin, are not well constrained. We performed visible to near-infrared multicolor photometry of 2024 PT$_5$ from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope during 2025 January 4-10. The Seimei/TriCCS observations of 2024 PT$_5$ cover phase angles from 14 deg to 27 deg, and were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system. In addition, we analyzed $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ photometry taken with the Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I 10-m telescope taken on 2025 January 16-17. Our lightcurves show brightness variations over time periods of several tens of minutes. We infer that 2024 PT$_5$ is in a tumbling state and has a lightcurve amplitude of about 0.3 mag. Visible and near-infrared color indices of 2024 PT$_5$, $g-r=0.567\pm0.044$, $r-i=0.155\pm0.009$, $r-z=0.147\pm0.066$, $Y-J=0.557\pm0.046$, $J-H=0.672\pm0.078$, and $H-Ks=0.148\pm0.098$, indicate that 2024 PT$_5$ is an S-complex asteroid, largely consistent with previous observations. Using the $H$-$G$ model, we derived an absolute magnitude $H_{V,HG}$ of $27.72\pm0.09$ and a slope parameter $G_V$ of $0.223\pm0.073$ in V-band. A geometric albedo of 2024 PT$_5$ is derived to be $0.26\pm0.07$ from the slope of its photometric phase curve. This albedo value is typical of the S- and Q-type NEAs. The color properties of 2024 PT$_5$ derived from our observations match rock samples taken from the lunar surface, which agrees with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Studying Ionospheric Phase Structure Functions Using Wide-Band uGMRT (Band-4) Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of the low-frequency radio sky ($&lt;$ 1~GHz) are largely limited by systematic effects introduced by the ionosphere. In this study, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48, carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to examine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations change with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our results, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725~MHz, show a clear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the diffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could guide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence is anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest diffractive scales do not always align with Earth's magnetic field, suggesting the influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The contribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a power-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping the observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water vapour is highly subsaturated in much of the Earth's atmosphere. This has important consequences for water vapour feedback, and also for general phenomena such as the runaway greenhouse. In this chapter, we discuss the processes that create subsaturation, with reference to both observations, general circulation models, and a range of idealized theoretical models which produce subsaturation. While this chapter focuses on subsaturation of water vapour in Earth's atmosphere, the processes discussed are generic to condensible substances in all planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Placing the Solar System in its Astrophysical Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine recent astronomical data to assess whether the sun and Solar System possess anomalous properties compared to other stars and exoplanetary systems, providing context for astrobiology research. Utilising data primarily from large surveys like {\it Gaia}, {\it Kepler}, {\it TESS}, and ground-based spectroscopy (e.g., GALAH, LAMOST, HARPS), we construct comparison samples (e.g., nearby stars, solar analogues and twins within 20-200 pc) and employ statistical methods, including regression analysis, to account for parameter dependencies. We find that the sun is modestly metal-rich compared to nearby solar-age stars. More anomalous solar properties include its mass (top $\sim$8 percent locally), low photometric variability on short timescales ($\sim$0.2 percent), specific light and heavy element abundance patterns (high beryllium, low lithium, low carbon/oxygen and nitrogen/oxygen ratios, and low heavy neutron capture and refractory elements), slow rotation, and low superflare rate. The sun has average $\alpha$/iron, phosphorus/iron, and Ytterbium/iron abundance ratios. It also has average chromospheric activity as measured by R$^{\rm '}_{\rm HK}$(T$_{\rm eff}$), R$^{\rm +}_{\rm HK}$, and H$\alpha$ indices. The Solar System is unusual in its lack of super-Earths despite hosting a cold Jupiter ($\sim$3 percent), the low eccentricities of its planets (especially considering detectability, $&lt;2$ percent), its large size scale for a multi-planet system ($\sim$6 percent), and potentially the sun's obliquity. The sun's galactic orbit is less eccentric and has lower vertical excursions than $\sim$95 percent of nearby solar analogues. Its current position is near perigalacticon and minimum distance from the Galactic plane, resulting in a higher local star density than 98.8 percent of randomly chosen times from $-0.5$ to $+0.5$ Gyrs.</description>

      <title>Mars Clocks and other novel analog clocks, using Earth Standard Seconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analog clocks fitted to the Mars solar day. These clocks use the standard Earth-based second of the International System of Units (SI) as their operational unit of time, unlike current practice for Mars timekeeping. We discuss the importance of preserving the SI second. On this basis, we identify the two analog clocks most suitable for public use by a future Mars population. These are a 20-hour clock with a hand motion similar to that of the standard Earth clock, and a 24-hour clock with a novel "Martian" hand motion which strikes the hour when all 3 hands converge onto that hour mark on the dial. Both clocks have Earth-day equivalents to assist learning. We also present a 24-hour "SpaceClock", similar to the Martian clock but with no favored reference plane, hence equally readable from any viewing orientation.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>

      <title>Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.</description>

      <title>Intermittency in Voyager Magnetic Field Beyond the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the two Voyager spacecraft traveled beyond the heliosphere, they encountered a magnetic field environment that had never been observed before. Studies have attempted to characterize this new regime by examining the magnetic field intermittency. This is typically done by fitting the optimal kappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to characterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent findings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field increments in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian statistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just beyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the heliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1) optimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether and how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3) determining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using magnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent techniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the distributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we find that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian distribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa values (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further demonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic Gaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our results show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field environment of the VLISM.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase Elemental abundances in Molecular cloudS (GEMS) XI. The evolution of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios in starless cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotopic ratios have been used as chemical diagnostics to investigate the origin of the material in the Solar System. We have determined the HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless cores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to constrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of HCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code DNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores, with average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\pm$0.019, 0.036$\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions (Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that reflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a significant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed values with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The 14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\pm$120) and HNC/H15NC (296$\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the deuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The Dfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless cores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N and HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the detected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The average value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than the values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating that nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar phase.</description>

Abstract: In this work, models of rubble pile binary secondaries are simulated in different spin states in a system similar in size and scale to Didymos-Dimorphos. The numerical modeling is performed in the N-body Chrono-based software GRAINS, which simulates gravity, contact, and friction forces acting on non-spherical mass elements. Tidal dissipation successfully emerges in the simulations as an aggregate of the effects of inter-element contact and friction across thousands of simulated mass elements. We devise computational techniques for simulating and studying such systems, establishing rigorous numerical procedures for computing tidal quantities of interest. We compute $Q/k_{2} \sim 71.6^{+99.6}_{-43.6}$ for the secondary, smaller than previously predicted ranges $10^{2} &lt; Q/k_{2} &lt; 10^{6}$, and thus a rather dissipative result. From our simulations, we observe non-classical variation of the tidal lag angle with the topographic longitude, and dependence of $Q/k_{2}$ on the rotation rate. Further study is required to see if the enhanced dissipativity holds with other geometries and regolith properties.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar inclination from tidal interaction of multiple-moon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by a collision between Theia and the proto-Earth, and the predicted lunar orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equatorial plane is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. We show that, after explaining Earth-Moon isotopic similarity in the framework of the canonical giant impact theory, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and the two moons with negligible orbital inclination could lead to the merger of the two moons with newly formed moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator exceeding 10 degrees.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Constraints on Dust Dynamics and Size Evolution in Protoplanetary Disk Rings. I. Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) have revealed many dust rings in protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as dust traps at gas pressure bumps. Previous studies have typically modeled these rings by assuming a single dust species in drift-diffusion equilibrium, neglecting dust size evolution resulting from coagulation and fragmentation. In this work, we perform numerical simulations that incorporate both dust-gas dynamics (drift and diffusion) and dust size evolution. Our results show that the radial distributions of different dust species (up to the fragmentation limit) are nearly identical in the dust ring, as dust growth dominates over drift and diffusion (e.g., with a typical dust-to-gas ratio of $\epsilon \sim 10^{-2}$). Building on this finding, we develop a comprehensive, self-consistent analytical theory that describes the dust ring structure while explicitly accounting for size evolution effects. Our model provides a unified framework for interpreting multi-wavelength observations by linking the physical dust distribution to the observed ring properties, thus laying the foundation for future observational modeling.</description>

      <title>Self-limited tidal heating and prolonged magma oceans in the L 98-59 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rocky exoplanets accessible to characterisation often lie on close-in orbits where tidal heating within their interiors is significant, with the L 98-59 planetary system being a prime example. As a long-term energy source for ongoing mantle melting and outgassing, tidal heating has been considered as a way to replenish lost atmospheres on rocky planets around active M-dwarfs. We simulate the early evolution of L 98-59 b, c and d using a time-evolved interior-atmosphere modelling framework, with a self-consistent implementation of tidal heating and redox-controlled outgassing. Emerging from our calculations is a novel self-limiting mechanism between radiative cooling, tidal heating, and mantle rheology, which we term the `radiation-tide-rheology feedback'. Our coupled modelling yields self-limiting tidal heating estimates that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous calculations, and yet are still large enough to enable the extension of primordial magma oceans to Gyr timescales. Comparisons with a semi-analytic model demonstrate that this negative feedback is a robust mechanism which can probe a given planet's initial conditions, atmospheric composition, and interior structure. The orbit and instellation of the sub-Venus L 98-59 b likely place it in a regime where tidal heating has kept the planet molten up to the present day, even if it were to have lost its atmosphere. For c and d, a long-lived magma ocean can be induced by tides only with additional atmospheric regulation of energy transport.</description>

      <title>The HOSTS Survey: Suspected variable dust emission and constraints on companions around {\theta} Boo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the HOSTS survey by the LBTI, an excess emission from the main sequence star {\theta} Boo (F7V spectral type, 14.5pc distance) was observed. This excess indicates the presence of exozodiacal dust near the habitable zone (HZ) of the star. Previous observations from Spitzer and Herschel showed no sign of outer cold dust within their respective detection limits. Additional nulling and high-contrast AO observations were taken to spatially constrain the dust distribution, search for variability, and directly image potential companions in the system. This study presents the results of these observations and provides an interpretation of the inner system's architecture. The star was observed using the LBTI's N'-band nulling mode during three epochs in 2017, 2018, and 2023. The dust distribution is modeled and constrained for each epoch using the standard LBTI nulling pipeline, assuming a vertically thin disk with a face-on inclination. In addition, high-contrast AO observations are performed in the L'-band and H-band to constrain the presence of substellar companions around the star. Several solutions are found for the dust distribution, and for each epoch. However, the LBTI nulling observations are not able to discriminate between them. Using the upper limits from previous observations, we constrain the representative size of the dust grains around 3-5$\mu$m. A tentative increase in dust brightness is also measured at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance between 2017 and 2023. Several options are considered to explain the origin of the observed dust and its variability, but no clear sources could be identified from the current observations. Partly because our high-contrast AO observations could only constrain the presence of companions down to $11M_\text{Jup}$ at 1.3" separation.</description>

      <title>Cold Jupiters and small planets: Friends, foes, or indifferent? A search for correlations with the largest exoplanet samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether there is any correlation between the presence of short-period small planets (SPs) with $P\lesssim100~d$ ($a \lesssim0.4~AU$) and $1&lt;M_{p}&lt;20~M_\oplus$ and that of outer cold Jupiters (CJs) with $a=1-10~AU$ and $M_{p}=0.5-20~M_{Jup}$ around solar-type stars may provide crucial constraints on models of formation and/or migration of SPs. However, discrepant results regarding the occurrence rates of CJs in SP systems have been reported in the literature, with some recent studies suggesting a strong SP-CJ correlation but only at super-solar metallicities and/or masses of the host stars. Here, we homogeneously recomputed the occurrence rates of CJs at average, sub-solar ($[Fe/H]&lt;-0.1$), solar ($-0.1\le[Fe/H]\le0.1$), and super-solar ($[Fe/H]&gt;0.1$) metallicity as well as at average and subintervals of stellar mass, namely 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, and 1.0-1.2 $M_\odot$, using (i) a carefully-selected sample of 217 SP systems, and (ii) a large comparison sample of 1167 solar-type stars. We determine the integrated occurrence rate of CJs in SP systems to be $f_{CJ|SP}=11.1^{+2.5}_{-1.8}\%$; this is consistent with the estimated frequencies of CJs in both the comparison sample ($f_{CJ}=9.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\%$) and the HARPS-N survey of transiting SP systems. We find a possible correlation ($f_{CJ|SP}&gt;f_{CJ}$) only at super-solar mass and metallicity, though with statistical confidence of less than $3\sigma$. To test some theoretical predictions, we also searched for possible SP-CJ relations as a function of SP and CJ multiplicity, as well as SP composition, and we found none. We show that the architectures of SP systems are not indifferent to the presence of CJs, because the multiplicity of SPs strongly depends on the CJ eccentricity, as expected from planetary dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of the relation between SPs and CJs requires larger samples of SP systems.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Detecting alien living worlds and photosynthetic life using imaging polarimetry with the HWO coronagraph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our Earth, being the only living planet that we know, provides us with clues that photosynthetic life-forms may be dominant on other exoplanets for billions of years. Spectropolarimetric signatures of the terrestrial photosynthetic life (PSLife) are well studied in the lab and remotely sensed with space and airborne instrumentation. An astonishing biosignature revealed by these measurements is an extremely strong linear polarization (tens \%) associated with broad absorption bands of biological pigments (biopigments) driving photosynthesis in various organisms. Also, unique circular-polarization signatures are associated with biopigments and other complex macromolecules as a sign of homochirality which is ubiquitous in terrestrial life forms. Thus, low-resolution spectro- or multi-band polarimetry of exoplanets directly imaged at an unprecedented contrast using the HWO coronagraph is a novel opportunity for a robust discovery of life on exoplanets. Here we propose to carry out two surveys and two follow-up observing programs. Survey 1 will identify potentially habitable planets (PHPs) through detection of atmospheres, clouds and liquid surface water (ocean) using linear polarimetry. Survey 2 will identify Living World (LW) candidates among PHPs by searching for strong linear polarization signatures associated with strong and broad absorption bands reminiscent of terrestrial biopigments. Follow-up program 3 will obtain multi-color surface maps of LWs, determine the distribution and abundance of alien photosynthetic organisms with exo-biopigments (exoBPs) and correlate their properties with the atmospheric and surface compositions. Follow-up program 4 will employ circular polarization to verify homochirality of exoBPs. This comprehensive approach aims at providing a quantitative answer to the ultimate question "Are we are alone in the Universe?".</description>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. \textbf{We obtained B,V, R, I, g, r, i, and z photometry with the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, the Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope on 2024 July 2, 3, and 6. We measured colour indices B-V=0.98$\pm$0.23, V-R=0.71$\pm$0.09, R-I=0.14$\pm$0.10, g-r=0.84$\pm$0.05 mag, r-i=0.16$\pm$0.03 mag, i-z=-0.02$\pm$0.07 mag, and g-i=1.00$\pm$0.05 mag and a spectral slope of 16.0$\pm$1.9 $\%$/100 nm.} We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 184.6$\pm$4.6 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. 3I/ATLAS's coma has FWHM$\simeq$2.2 arcsec and A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$=280.8$\pm$3.2 cm. \textbf{We estimate that 3I/ATLAS's \textmu m-scale to mm-scale dust is ejected at $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying a dust production of $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss generalized linear models for directional data where the conditional distribution of the response is a von Mises-Fisher distribution in arbitrary dimension or a Bingham distribution on the unit circle. To do this properly, we parametrize von Mises-Fisher distributions by Euclidean parameters and investigate computational aspects of this parametrization. Then we modify this approach for local polynomial regression as a means of nonparametric smoothing of distributional data. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and a data set from planetary sciences involving covariate vectors on a sphere with axial response.</description>

      <title>Linear and Regular Kepler-Manev Dynamics via Projective Transformations: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric formulation for transforming nonconservative mechanical Hamiltonian systems and introduces a new method for regularizing and linearizing central force dynamics -- in particular, Kepler and Manev dynamics -- through a projective transformation. The transformation is formulated as a configuration space diffeomorphism (rather than a submersion) that is lifted to a cotangent bundle (phase space) symplectomorphism and used to pullback the original mechanical Hamiltonian system, Riemannian kinetic energy metric, and other key geometric objects. Full linearization of both Kepler and Manev dynamics (in any finite dimension) is achieved by a subsequent conformal scaling of the projectively-transformed Hamiltonian vector field. Two such conformal scalings are given, both achieving linearization. Arbitrary conservative and nonconservative perturbations are included, with closed-form solutions readily obtained in the unperturbed Kepler or Manev cases.</description>
