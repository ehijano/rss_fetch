      <title>Towards relational foundations for spacetime quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics tells us that the description of a system in the formalism of quantum mechanics is not an absolute, but it is relative to the observer itself. The interpretation goes further and proposes a set of axioms. In standard non relational language, one of them states that an observer can only retrieve finite amount information from a system by means of measurement. Our contribution starts with the observation that quantum mechanics, i.e. quantum field theory (QFT) in dimension 1, radically differs from QFT in higher dimensions. In higher dimensions boundary data (or initial data) cannot be specified by means of finitely many measurements. This calls for a notion of measuring scale, which we provide. At a given measuring scale the observer has partial information about the system. Our notion of measuring scale generalizes the one implicitly used in Wilsonian QFT, where at each measuring scale there are effective theories, which may be corrected, and if the theory turns out to be renormalizable the mentioned corrections converge to determine a completely corrected (or renormalized) theory at the given measuring scale. The notion of a measuring scale is the cornerstone of Wilsonian QFT. This notion tells us that we are not describing a system from an absolute perspective. An effective theory at that scale describes the system with respect to the observer, which may retrieve information from the system by means of measurement in a specific way determined by our notion of measuring scale. We claim that a relational interpretation of quantum physics for spacetimes of dimension greater than 1 is Wilsonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum secure direct communication of continuous-time signals using Whittaker Nyquist Shannon theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we provide a new quantum secure direct communication protocol and its experimental implementation. The proposed protocol can be used to transfer, in a secure way, continuous signals, like audio signal, from Alice to Bob. The security is guaranteed by the quantum nature of optical signals and the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon theorem. Furthermore, it can be easily implemented with common optical devices that are commercially available.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <title>A competitive NISQ and qubit-efficient solver for the LABS problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) has recently been introduced as a qubit-efficient approach to combinatorial optimization problems within variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). The method offers a polynomial reduction in qubit count and a super-polynomial suppression of barren plateaus. Moreover, it has been shown to feature a competitive performance with classical state-of-the-art methods on MaxCut. Here, we extend the PCE-based framework to solve the Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS) problem. This is a notoriously hard problem with a single instance per problem size, considered a major benchmark for classical and quantum solvers. We simulate our PCE variational quantum solver for LABS instances of up to $N=44$ binary variables using only $n=6$ qubits and a brickwork circuit Ansatz of depth $10$, with a total of $30$ two-qubit gates, i.e. well inside the NISQ regime. We observe a significant scaling advantage in the total time to (the exact) solution of our solver with respect to previous studies using QAOA, and even a modest advantage with respect to the leading classical heuristic, given by Tabu search. Our findings point at PCE-based solvers as a promising quantum-inspired classical heuristic for hard-in-practice problems as well as a tool to reduce the resource requirements for actual quantum algorithms, with both fundamental and applied potential implications.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithms with exact geodesic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term applications of quantum computers, but their training represents a major challenge in practice. We introduce exact-geodesic VQAs, a curvature-aware framework that enables analytic Riemannian optimization of variational quantum circuits through a convenient choice of circuit ansatz. Our method exploits the exact metric to find a parameter optimization path based on exact geodesic transport with conjugate gradients (EGT-CG). This supersedes the quantum natural gradient method, in fact recovering it as its first-order approximation. Further, the exact-geodesic updates for our circuit ansatz have the same measurement cost as standard gradient descent. This contrasts with previous metric-aware methods, which require resource-intensive estimations of the metric tensor using quantum hardware. In numerical simulations for electronic structure problems of up to 14 spin-orbitals, our framework allows us to achieve up to a 20x reduction in the number of iterations over Adam or quantum natural gradient methods. Moreover, for degenerate cases, which are notoriously difficult to optimize with conventional methods, we achieve rapid convergence to the global minima. Our work demonstrates that the cost of VQA optimization can be drastically reduced by harnessing the Riemannian geometry of the manifold expressed by the circuit ansatz, with potential implications at the interface between quantum machine learning, differential geometry, and optimal control theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Experiments Performed on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on exotic spin systems that model quantum materials. However, quantum annealing experiments have yet to explore magnetic memory and hysteresis, features seemingly at odds with hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling, favoring forgetfulness. Here, we present a general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis in a transverse-field Ising model. We implement it on three D-Wave superconducting flux qubit annealers, using up to thousands of spins, and explore both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models across contrasting graph topologies. Crucially, we observe robust memory retention in hysteresis loops, establishing quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena. This approach enables many topics of future exploration including return point memory and hysteresis in frustrated or topologically ordered systems, thus broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase in Pathangled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce pathangled quantum states, spatially correlated systems governed via production angles, to achieve geometric control of entanglement beyond spin/polarization constraints. By driving the system through cyclic adiabatic evolution of an external parameter in Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we demonstrate that Berry phases and production angles become additional degrees of freedom for Bell correlations. We identify an approximate critical angle $24.97^\circ$ that geometrically manifests the Bell-limit for certain measurement settings, delineating boundaries between local-hidden-variable theories and quantum mechanics. This framework simplifies state preparation while enabling geometry-driven entanglement control, thus providing distinct experimental advantages.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Squeezing of Superpositions of Quadrature Eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of operators exploiting the symmetry of superpositions of quadrature eigenstates (SQE) and demonstrate how the associated nonlinear squeezing, quantified by the expectation value of such operators, serves both as a witness of non-Gaussianity and as an indicator of the quality of SQE approximations. To establish the usefulness of this measure, we connect it to quantum state fidelity and evaluate its implications in breeding protocols. Finally, we construct optimal approximations of SQE states in truncated Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>Multi-NARP Laser Driving Scheme for Multiplexed Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed NARP scheme for laser-triggered single-photon sources to the simultaneous excitation of multiple emitters with varying transition energies, laying the groundwork for wavelength-division multiplexing in quantum optical networks. Our Multi-NARP scheme does not rely on polarization filtering and thus enables the near-unity extraction efficiency of single photons from each quantum dot. Our approach also offers the advantages of robustness to variations in the laser pulse parameters and immunity to excitation-induced dephasing tied to electron-phonon coupling. We show that simultaneous triggering of at least 10 emitters is possible, enabling the development of high-bandwidth quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Information theoretic measures within Schr\"odinger-Dunkl framework in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have presented analytical solution of Schr\"odinger-Dunkl equation with Deng-Fan molecular potential in spherical coordinates. The ro-vibrational energy of some selected diatomic molecules ScH, TiH, VH and CrH are obtained under a simple, new approximation to the centrifugal term in presence of three reflection operators and Dunkl parameters. The angular wave functions are obtained in terms of Jacobi polynomial, whereas radial wave functions in terms of hypergeometric function. The analytical results of Shannon entropy, expectation, Heisenberg uncertainty, entropic moment, disequilibrium, R\'enyi entropy and Tsallis entropy of marginal density (radial r, and angular {\theta}, {\phi}) and total density functions are obtained in Schr\"odinger-Dunkl system with respect to the weighted Lebesgue measure. This has been possible by making use of factorization method for Shannon entropy. The absolute per cent deviation between the analytical and numerical results for all the information theoretic measures remain well within 0.0001%. The effect of reflection operators on angular wave solutions and on information theoretic measures are shown. In essence, a number of statistical measures have been reported for Deng-Fan potential in the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger framework.</description>

      <title>On the excitability of two-level atoms by spectrally encoded single-photon wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon wave packets are utilized as quantum information carriers within quantum information science and quantum communication applications. Here, we analyze the time-dependent interaction of a two-level atom with a spectrally encoded single-photon wave packet and obtain the excitation probability of the atom based on the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Our results show that the spectral encoding process causes the single-photon wave packet to spread in the time domain, and the intensity of the wave packet decreases. Therefore, an encoded single-photon wave packet excites a two-level atom much weaker than an uncoded one. These results are crucial for understanding how encoded quantum light interacts with quantum nodes in realistic quantum networks. In particular, they reveal limitations and trade-offs in using spectrally encoded photons for secure, multiplexed quantum communication. The findings offer insights into optimizing encoding strategies for efficient atom-photon interactions and contribute to the development of scalable and secure quantum networking protocols.</description>

      <title>Revealing Quantum Information Encoded in Classical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a simple quantum pre-processing filter kernel designed with only two CNOT gates for image feature extraction. We examine the impact of these filters when combined with a classical neural network for image classification tasks. Our main hypothesis is that this circuit can extract pixel correlation information that classical filters cannot. This approach is akin to a convolutional neural network, but with quantum layers replacing convolutional layers to extract spatial pixel entanglement. We found that a small circuit with just two CNOT gates can be engineered in three different spatial symmetries, each affecting classification differently. While the filter improves classification when combined with a simple, narrow network, it does not surpass complex classical methods. However, the filter demonstrates potential to enhance classification performance in more sophisticated architectures. Despite this, our empirical results show no clear correlation between the observed improvements and the level of entanglement in the quantum circuit, as measured by Von Neumann Entropy. The underlying cause of this improvement remains unclear and warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Edge of Many-Body Quantum Chaos in Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a machine learning paradigm that harnesses dynamical systems as computational resources. In its quantum extension -- quantum reservoir computing (QRC) -- these principles are applied to quantum systems, whose rich dynamics broadens the landscape of information processing. In classical RC, optimal performance is typically achieved at the ``edge of chaos," the boundary between order and chaos. Here, we identify its quantum many-body counterpart using the QRC implemented on the celebrated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our analysis reveals substantial performance enhancements near two distinct characteristic ``edges": a temporal boundary defined by the Thouless time, beyond which system dynamics is described by random matrix theory, and a parametric boundary governing the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes. These findings establish the ``edge of many-body quantum chaos" as a fundamental design principle for QRC.</description>

      <title>Erbium Quantum Memory Platform with Long Optical Coherence via Back-End of Line Deposition on Foundry-Fabricated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing scalable quantum interconnects necessitates the integration of solid-state quantum memories with foundry photonics processes. While prior photonic integration efforts have relied upon specialized, laboratory-scale fabrication techniques, this work demonstrates the monolithic integration of a quantum memory platform with low-loss foundry photonic circuits via back-end-of-line deposition. We deposited thin films of titanium dioxide ($\mathrm{TiO_2}$) doped with erbium (Er) onto silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides and studied Er optical coherence at sub-Kelvin temperatures with photon echo techniques. We suppressed optical dephasing through ex-situ oxygen annealing and optimized measurement conditions, which yielded an optical coherence time of 64 $\mu$s (a 5 kHz homogeneous linewidth) and slow spectral diffusion of 27 kHz over 4 ms, results that are comparable to state-of-the-art erbium devices. Combined with second-long electron spin lifetimes and demonstrated electrical control of Er emission, our findings establish Er:$\mathrm{TiO_2}$ on foundry photonics as a manufacturable platform for ensemble and single-ion quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Residue Number System (RNS) based Distributed Quantum Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplication of quantum states is a frequently used function or subroutine in quantum algorithms and applications, making quantum multipliers an essential component of quantum arithmetic. However, quantum multiplier circuits suffer from high Toffoli depth and T gate usage, which ultimately affects their scalability and applicability on quantum computers. To address these issues, we propose utilizing the Residue Number System (RNS) based distributed quantum multiplication, which executes multiple quantum modulo multiplication circuits across quantum computers or jobs with lower Toffoli depth and T gate usage. Towards this end, we propose a design of Quantum Diminished-1 Modulo $(2^n+1)$ Multiplier, an essential component of RNS based distributed quantum multiplication. We provide estimates of quantum resource usage and compare them with those of an existing non-distributed quantum multiplier for 6 to 16 qubit sized output. Our comparative analysis estimates up to 46.018% lower Toffoli depth, and reduction in T gates of 34.483% to 86.25%.</description>

      <title>The Dirac--Bergmann approach to optimal control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for optimal control in both classical and quantum systems. Our approach leverages the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm: a systematic method for formulating and solving constrained dynamical systems. In contrast to the standard Pontryagin principle, which is used in control theory, our approach bypasses the need to perform a variation to obtain the optimal solution. Instead, the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm generates the optimal solution dynamically. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through two quintessential examples: the classical and quantum brachistochrone problems, the latter relevant for quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable Antichiral Hinge State in Photonic Synthetic Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in 2-dimensional (2D) topological matter has generalized the notion of edge states from chiral to antichiral configurations with the same propagating direction at parallel edges, revealing a rich variety of robust transport phenomena. Here, we propose that antichiral hinge states can emerge in a 3D higher-order topological insulator/semimetal, where two surface/bulk Dirac points are connected by the hinge states. The band dispersion can be controlled and tilted independently for each hinge using properly designed tunnelings, resulting in tunable antichiral hinge states with programmable propagation direction and velocity. Moreover, we propose experimental realization schemes based on a 1D coupled cavity array with additional synthetic dimensions represented by the photonic orbital angular momentum and frequency. We innovatively introduce both longitudinal and transversal electro-optic modulators to generate the desired tunable tunnelings along the synthetic dimensions, which significantly reduce the experimental complexity by eliminating the need for beam splittings and auxiliary cavities. The tunable antichiral hinge states are confirmed by the photonic transmission spectra. Our work presents the robust and tunable antichiral hinge-state transports which paves the way for exploring novel topological matter and their device applications.</description>

      <title>Imaging of microwave magnetic field orientation using continuous-wave experiments on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging of microwave magnetic fields with nano-scale resolution has interesting applications. Specifically, detecting the orientation of the microwave fields is useful in condensed matter physics and quantum control. However, most of the existing methods for microwave field imaging are limited to detecting the magnitude of the fields. Due to their small sensor size and favorable optical and spin properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly suitable for imaging dc and ac magnetic fields. The reported methods for detecting the orientation of microwave magnetic fields use pulsed Rabi frequency measurements. Here, we demonstrate imaging of the orientation of microwave magnetic fields by only using continuous-wave experiments on NV centers. This simplifies the sensor apparatus and is particularly advantageous in applications where pulsing of the target microwave field is not possible. The method requires static bias magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the quantization axis of NV centers. We detect the direction of an arbitrary microwave magnetic field using NV centers of two different orientations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the projection of the microwave fields onto a plane can be imaged using NV centers of single orientation. It can be straightforwardly implemented using a single NV center.</description>

      <title>A Solvable Semi-infinite Fock-state-lattice SSH Model: the Stable Topological Zero Mode and the Non-Hermitian Bound Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</description>

      <title>Sensing Electric Currents in an a-IGZO TFT-Based Circuit Using a Quantum Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) is an emerging magnetic imaging tool enabling noninvasive characterization of electronic circuits through spatially mapping current densities. In this work, we demonstrate wafer-level current sensing of a current mirror circuit composed of 16 amorphous-indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). a-IGZO TFTs are promising for flexible electronics due to their high performance. Using QDM, we obtain two-dimensional (2D) magnetic field images produced by DC currents, from which accurate current density maps are extracted. Notably, QDM measurements agree well with conventional electrical probing measurements, and enable current sensing in internal circuit paths inaccessible via conventional methods. Our results highlight QDM's capability as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the characterization of emerging semiconductor technologies, especially oxide-based TFTs. This approach provides essential insights to fabrication engineers, with potential to improve yield and reliability in flexible electronics manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic in Discrete-Time Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magic, which accounts for the non-stabilizer content of a state, is essential for universal quantum computation beyond classically simulable resources. We investigate the generation and evolution of quantum magic in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) using the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy as a measure of quantum magic. We investigate single- and two-walker quantum walks on a one-dimensional lattice, considering a wide range of initial coin states. Our results reveal that DTQWs can dynamically generate significant magic, with the amount and structure strongly dependent on the initial state of the coin. In the case of a single walker, the relationship between magic and entanglement is found to be nontrivial and complementary at long times. These findings position DTQWs as accessible and controllable platforms for producing quantum magic, offering a new perspective on their role in quantum information processing and reliable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Physically motivated decompositions of single qutrit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although only two quantum states of a physical system are often used to encode quantum information in the form of qubits, many levels can in principle be used to obtain qudits and increase the information capacity of the system. To take advantage of the additional levels, a parameterization of unitary transformations in terms of experimentally realizable operations is needed. Many parameterizations of unitary 3 * 3 matrices (U(3)) exist. One decomposition of a general unitary matrix can be expressed as the product of an exponential of a diagonal matrix and an exponential of an off-diagonal matrix. This decomposition is relevant for controlling superconducting qutrits using fixed-frequency resonant control pulses. This decomposition is numerically confirmed to allow the parameterization of any element in U(3). It is shown that a simple setting of parameter ranges of parameters can easily lead to an over-parameterization, in the sense that several different sets of values for the parameters produce the same element in U(3). This fact is demonstrated using the Walsh-Hadamard (WH) matrix as an example, which is also a special qutrit gate of practical interest. The different decompositions are shown to be related, and the relationships between them are presented using general methods. The shortest path needed for the implementation of a qutrit gate is found. Other parameterizations obtained by other analytic means, which can be advantageous for various reasons, are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips. We measured the resonance frequency and internal quality factor in response to temperature sweeps to evaluate the effect of quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Hybrid Support Vector Machines for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitive data captured by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a large role in the safety and integrity of many critical infrastructures. Detection of anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores. Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels. This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics. Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential "quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization algorithms for diagonalizing quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagonalizing a Hamiltonian, which is essential for simulating its long-time dynamics, is a key primitive in quantum computing and has been proven to yield a quantum advantage for several specific families of Hamiltonians. Yet, despite its importance, only a handful of diagonalization algorithms exist, and correspondingly few families of fast-forwardable Hamiltonians have been identified. This paper introduces classical optimization algorithms for Hamiltonian diagonalization by formulating a cost function that penalizes off-diagonal terms and enforces unitarity via an orthogonality constraint, both expressed in the Pauli operator basis. We pinpoint a class of Hamiltonians that highlights severe drawbacks of existing methods, including exponential per-iteration cost, exponential circuit depth, or convergence to spurious optima. Our approach overcomes these shortcomings, achieving polynomial-time efficiency while provably avoiding suboptimal points. As a result, we broaden the known realm of fast-forwardable systems, showing that quantum-diagonalizable Hamiltonians extend to cases generated by exponentially large Lie algebras. On the practical side, we also present a randomized-coordinate variant that achieves a more efficient per-iteration cost than the deterministic counterpart. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms through explicit examples and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Attainable quantum speed limit for N-dimensional quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and provides a lower bound on the evolution time. The attainability of QSL, greatly depending on the understanding of QSL, is a long-standing open problem especially for high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we solve this problem by establishing a QSL suitable and attainable for both open and closed quantum systems based on a new proposed state distance. It is shown that given any initial state in a certain dimension, our QSL bound can always be saturated by unitary and non-unitary dynamics, and for any given Hamiltonian for a unitary evolution, a pair of states always exists, saturating the bound. As applications, we demonstrate the QSL time attained by various physical settings. This paper will shed new light on the QSL problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for self-testing, in which bipartite correlations are described by states on the commuting tensor product of a pair of operator systems. We propose a definition of a local isometry between bipartite quantum systems in the commuting operator model, and define self-testing and abstract self-testing in the latter generality. We show that self-tests are in the general case always abstract self-tests and that, in some cases, the converse is also true. We apply our framework in a variety of instances, including to correlations with quantum inputs and outputs, quantum commuting correlations for the CHSH game, synchronous correlations, contextuality scenarios, quantum colourings and Schur quantum channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) have emerged as a promising direction in quantum machine learning, combining the strengths of quantum computing and adversarial training to enable efficient and expressive generative modeling. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QGAN models, highlighting key advances from theoretical proposals to experimental realizations. We categorize existing QGAN architectures based on their quantum-classical hybrid structures and summarize their applications in fields such as image synthesis, medical data generation, channel prediction, software defect detection, and educational tools. Special attention is given to the integration of QGANs with domain-specific techniques, such as optimization heuristics, Wasserstein distance, variational circuits, and large language models. We also review experimental demonstrations on photonic and ion-trap quantum processors, assessing their feasibility under current hardware limitations. This survey aims to guide future research by outlining existing trends, challenges, and opportunities in developing QGANs for practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-Robust Dynamical Decoupling for Bipartite-Topology Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol that modifies dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences to be robust to static $ZZ$ crosstalk when implemented with bounded control on two-colorable qubit topologies. The protocol, which relies on modifications to the pulse timing, can be applied to any sequence with equidistant $\pi$-pulses. We motivate the method theoretically via suppression conditions identified through time-dependent perturbation theory. Theoretical findings are supported by demonstrations of widely studied sequences on several superconducting qubit devices offered by the IBM Quantum Platform. Using up to 20 qubits on fixed-coupler devices, we observe at least a $3\times$ improvement in the fidelity decay rate via our approach when compared to non-robust DD variants. In addition, we leverage our approach to assess the impact of $ZZ$ errors on tunable-coupler devices. We find that $ZZ$-robust sequences perform nearly equivalent to non-robust DD, affirming the reduced impact of such errors in a tunable-coupler architecture. Nevertheless, our demonstrations indicate that fixed-coupler devices, when subject to DD-protection, can outperform tunable-coupler devices. Our method broadens the scope of practical DD protocols: with modest overhead and a reasonable constraint on the qubit topology, the method attains significant performance improvements on modern quantum computing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the profound connection between physics and computation by proposing and examining the model of non-Hermitian quantum computer (NQC). In addition to conventional quantum gates such as the Hadamard gate, phase gate, and CNOT gate, this computing model incorporates a non-unitary quantum gate $G$.We show that NQC is extraordinarily powerful, not only capable of solving all NP problems but also all problems within the complexity class $\text{P}^{\sharp\text{P}}$ in polynomial time. We investigate two physical schemes for implementing the non-unitary gate $G$ and find that the remarkable computational power of NQC originates from the exponentially large amount of physical resources required in these implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures, described by mixed states, pose significant challenges due to the triviality of the Uhlmann bundle. We introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number, to characterize the topological properties of mixed states. By inserting the density matrix into the Chern character, we introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number that reduces to the pure-state value in the zero-temperature limit and vanishes at infinite temperature, providing a framework to study the temperature-dependent evolution of topological features in mixed states. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous mathematical proof that the first- and higher-order Uhlmann-Chern numbers converge to the corresponding Chern numbers in the zero-temperature limit, differing only by a factor of $1/D$ for $D$-fold degenerate ground states. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through applications to a two-level system, the coherent state model, the 2D Haldane model, and a four-band model, highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of topological invariants. Our results establish a robust bridge between the topological properties of pure and mixed states, offering new insights into finite-temperature topological phases.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling bounds and scalable partitioning for quantum circuit cutting beyond bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for identifying cutting locations for quantum circuit cutting, with a primary focus on partitioning circuits into three or more parts. Under the assumption that the classical postprocessing function is decomposable, we derive a new upper bound on the sampling overhead resulting from both time-like and space-like cuts. We show that this bound improves upon the previously known bound by orders of magnitude in cases of three or more partitions. Based on this bound, we formulate an objective function, $L_Q^{}$, and present a method to determine cutting locations that minimize it. Our method is shown to outperform a previous approach in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the obtained partitioning is found to be comparable to or better than that of the baseline in all but a few cases, as measured by $L_Q^{}$. These results are obtained by identifying cutting locations in a number of benchmark circuits of the size and type expected in quantum computations that outperform classical computers.</description>

      <title>Planar Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Low Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation critically depends on architectures uniting high encoding rates with physical implementability. Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, including bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, achieve dramatic reductions in qubit overhead, yet their logical operations remain a key challenge under planar hardware constraints. Here, we introduce code craft, a framework for designing fault-tolerant logical operations on planar BB codes within a translationally invariant, two-dimensional qubit lattice. By systematically deforming codes through local modifications-stretching, cutting, and painting-we enable the manipulation of logical qubits using strictly planar operations. We establish fault tolerance through numerical optimization of code distances and show that logical operations, including controlled-NOT gates, state transfers, and Pauli measurements, can be efficiently implemented within this framework to assemble an individually addressable logical qubit network. Universal quantum computation can then be realized by coupling just one BB-code logical qubit to a surface-code block. By combining the high encoding efficiency of qLDPC codes with geometric locality, our approach offers a practical and resource-efficient path to fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced quantum synchronization of spin chain with periodic boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum synchronization offers new possibilities for the exploration of collective dynamics in many-body systems. However, achieving synchronization in many-body quantum systems still faces numerous challenges. Here, we focus on the synchronization behavior of quantum spin chain with periodic boundary conditions under the influence of local Gaussian white noise. The necessary conditions for synchronization of local spin observables when noise acts on individual spin and two spins are obtained. The degree of synchronization between the expectation values of the local spin observables is characterized by utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient, while the frequency of oscillation is determined through the application of fast Fourier transformation. We also discuss qualitatively the effect of system parameters on synchronization time. Despite the presence of noise leading to decoherence in the system, entanglement between synchronous and antisynchronous spins still persists. Our results provide valuable insights toward the realization of quantum synchronization in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-Andr\'e (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-Andr\'e model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.</description>

      <title>Programmable Bell State Generation in an Integrated Thin Film Lithium Niobate Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum technologies such as cryptography, sensing, and computing. Photon pairs generated via nonlinear optical processes are excellent for preparing entangled states due to their long coherence times and compatibility with fiber optic networks. Steady progress in nanofabrication has positioned lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) as a leading platform for monolithic integration of photon pair sources into optical circuits, leveraging its strong second-order nonlinearity. Here, we present a reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit on LNOI, which combines two on-chip photon pair sources with programmable interferometers, enabling generation of entangled states. The pair sources achieve a source brightness of MHz nm$^{-1}$ mW$^{-1}$ while maintaining a coincidence-to-accidental ratio above 100. We successfully interfere the two sources with $99 \pm 0.7$ % visibility, demonstrating the indistinguishability required for producing entanglement on-chip. We show preparation of any of the maximally entangled Bell states with fidelity above 90 % verified by quantum state tomography. These results establish LNOI as a compelling, scalable platform to explore integrated quantum photonic technologies enabled by high-brightness sources of entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</description>

      <title>Programming Quantum Computers with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise transformative change to fields as diverse as medical diagnosis, legal services, and software development. One reason for such an impact is LLMs' ability to make highly technical endeavors more accessible to a broader audience. Accessibility has long been a goal for the growing fields of quantum computing, informatics, and engineering, especially as more quantum systems become publicly available via cloud interfaces. Between programming quantum computers and using LLMs, the latter seems the more accessible task: while leveraging an LLM's fullest potential requires experience with prompt engineering, any literate person can provide queries and read responses. By contrast, designing and executing quantum programs -- outside of those available online -- requires significant background knowledge, from selection of operations for algorithm implementation to configuration choices for particular hardware specifications and providers. Current research is exploring LLM utility for classical software development, but there has been relatively little investigation into the same for quantum programming. Consequently, this work is a first look at how well an uncustomized, publicly available LLM can write straightforward quantum circuits. We examine how well OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4) can write quantum circuits for two hardware providers: the superconducting qubit machines of IBM and the photonic devices of Xanadu. We find that ChatGPT currently fares substantially better with the former.</description>

      <title>Dilution of Entanglement: Unveiling Quantum State Discrimination Advantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The states in the three-qubit GHZ SLOCC class can exhibit diverse entanglement patterns, as they may have no entanglement in any reduced subsystems, or show entanglement across one, two, or all three bipartite cuts. Significant research has explored how such states can be used in entanglement-assisted discrimination tasks. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between probability of error and amount of bipartite and multiparty entanglement, examining how different levels of entanglement impact the accuracy of state discrimination. Also we have shown that the generic class of GHZ state provide some advantages in probabilistic distinguishibility. However, perfect discrimination typically requires maximally entangled states. The use of non-maximally entangled states as a resource for perfect discrimination remains an open problem in this area of research. In this manuscript, we propose a method to explore the perfect distinguishability of orthogonal product states using non-maximally entangled states, utilizing the GHZ SLOCC class structure. Moreover, these findings offer deeper insights into the relationship between entanglement classification and nonlocality, potentially shedding light on how different entanglement structures influence nonlocal behavior in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding entanglement and resolving the measurement problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize a recently proposed resolution of the quantum measurement problem. It stems from an insight into entanglement demonstrated in a 1991 experiment involving photon momenta. This experiment shows that, when two superposed quantum systems A and B are entangled, the resulting "pre-measurement state" is not a paradoxical macroscopic superposition of compound states of the two subsystems; for example, Schrodinger's cat is not "smeared" between dead and alive. It is instead a non-local superposition of correlations between states of the subsystems. In Schrodinger's example, an undecayed nucleus is correlated with a live cat, AND a decayed nucleus is correlated with a dead cat, where "AND" indicates the superposition on. This is exactly what we want. We have misinterpreted "dyads" |A&gt; |B&gt; where "A" and "B" are subsystems of a composite system AB. A&gt; |B&gt; does not mean states |A&gt; and |B&gt; both exist. It means instead |B&gt; exists if and only |A&gt; exists, i.e. |A&gt; and |B&gt; are correlated. It is a fact of nature that such correlations are nonlocally coherent: The degree of correlation between A and B depends on the nonlocal phase angle between the arbitrarily distant subsystems. Such coherent correlations are central to the nonlocal collapse of wave functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements are important tools in quantum information, represented by positive, operator-valued measures. A wide class of symmetric measurements is given via generalized equiangular measurements that form conical 2-designs. We show that only two positive constants are needed to fully characterize a variety of important quantum measures constructed from such operators. Examples are given for entropic uncertainty relations, the Brukner-Zeilinger invariants, quantum coherence, quantum concurrence, and the Schmidt-number criterion for entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>Correlated Error Bursts in a Gap-Engineered Superconducting Qubit Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the roadblocks towards the implementation of a fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processor is impacts of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. Such impacts temporarily elevate the density of quasiparticles (QPs) across the device, leading to correlated qubit error bursts. The most damaging errors, $T_1$ errors, stem from QP tunneling across the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs). Recently, we demonstrated that this type of error can be strongly suppressed by engineering the profile of superconducting gap at the JJs in a way that prevents QP tunneling. In this work, we identify a new type of impact-induced correlated error that persists in the presence of gap engineering. We observe that impacts shift the frequencies of the affected qubits, and thus lead to correlated phase errors. The frequency shifts are systematically negative, reach values up to $3\,{\rm MHz}$, and last for $\sim 1\,{\rm ms}$. We provide evidence that the shifts originate from QP-qubit interactions in the JJ region. Further, we demonstrate that the shift-induced phase errors can be detrimental to the performance of quantum error correction protocols.</description>

      <title>Modulator-Assisted Local Control of Quantum Battery via Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are devices designed to store and deliver energy using quantum mechanics. In charger-mediated protocols, energy is transferred from a charger to batteries via their interaction, typically modulated through quenches that require either global or local access to the primary systems. Such control schemes can introduce noise and become impractical for long-range charging scenarios, where the charger and battery are spatially separated. To overcome these limitations, we propose a modulator-assisted scheme that enables indirect control of energy transfer using only local operations on a third system, the modulator, which interacts only with the charger. The charger-battery interaction remains always on and requires no direct control during the charging cycle. Instead, repeated unitary pulses applied to the modulator exploit the quantum Zeno effect to dynamically modulate the effective coupling strength, thereby controlling the battery's charging speed. Our protocol enables the potential of remote, platform-independent control of energy flow and provides a framework for engineering interactions in spatially distributed quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of Quantum Many-Body Scars in Kinetically Constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum many-body scars (QMBS) has been studied both theoretically and experimentally, due to its unusual violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). In this paper, we extend the ETH to a new description based on the grand canonical ensemble to depict the thermal properties of QMBS models. For this purpose, we embed the dynamics of kinetically constrained systems within the Lindblad-like master equation, and demonstrate that the violation of the ETH by scar eigenstates is related to their slow decay in the corresponding dissipative process. Within this open system description, we reformulate the ETH to demonstrate that both scar eigenstates and thermal ones exhibit thermalization governed by grand canonical statistics. Consequently, our revised ETH unifies scars and thermal states under a cohesive thermodynamic rule. Our work resolves the fundamental tension between constraint-induced non-ergodicity and thermalization paradigms, establishing a unified route to generalized thermalization for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute all third-order local invariants accessible via randomised measurements and employ them to derive separability criteria. The reconstruction of the invariants yields experimentally accessible entanglement criteria %and an experimentally accessible second-order Renyi entropy for multipartite states with arbitrary local dimensions. The results show that third-order invariants capture inter-subsystem correlations beyond second-order spectral criteria within more feasible entanglement detection protocols than full tomography. As an example, for Werner states in $d=3$ the entanglement is detected for $p&gt;\frac 12$ at the second-order correlations, and it is improved to $p&gt;\frac 1{\sqrt[3]{10}}$ at the third-order.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions and Edge-State Transfer in Time-Multiplexed Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase transitions and edge-state properties of a time-multiplexed nonunitary quantum walk with sublattice symmetry. By constructing a Floquet operator incorporating tunable gain and loss, we systematically analyze both unitary and nonunitary regimes. In the unitary case, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) is preserved, with edge modes localized at opposite boundaries as predicted by topological invariants. In contrast, the nonunitary regime exhibits non-Hermitian skin effects, leading to a breakdown of the conventional BBC. By applying non-Bloch band theory and generalized Brillouin zones, we restore a generalized BBC and reveal a novel transfer phenomenon, where edge modes with different sublattice symmetries can become localized at the same boundary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the structure of the spectral loops in the complex quasienergy plane provides a clear signature for these transfer behaviors. Our findings deepen the understanding of nonunitary topological phases and offer valuable insights for the experimental realization and control of edge states in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Certification of high stellar ranks of quantum states of light with a pair of click detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rank of quantum states of light quantifies the amount of non-Gaussian resources required for their generation. One popular and practical approach to certification of stellar rank is based on measurement of click statistics with an array of binary detectors that can only distinguish the presence and absence of photons. Specifically, it was shown that measurements with an array of m+1 detectors allows one to certify stellar rank of approximate Fock state |m&gt;, even when the state is subjected to losses or certain noise. Here we address the question how many click detectors are in principle required to certify high stellar ranks. We show that two click detectors arranged in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss setup suffice. An important requirement is that the total detection efficiency of the detectors is sufficiently low but well calibrated. Interestingly, losses affect the response of the detection scheme in a way that can be exploited to certify stellar rank of high Fock states. We explicitly construct the corresponding stellar rank witnesses and discuss dependence of the stellar rank thresholds on parameters of the considered setup. Our results reveal that it is possible to certify high stellar ranks even with a minimalistic scheme that provides only very coarse grained information about the photon number statistics of the characterized state.</description>

      <title>Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>R\'{e}nyi and Shannon mutual information in critical and decohered critical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information, connecting between R\'{e}nyi mutual information and R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information. This R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the R\'{e}nyi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information and R\'{e}nyi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that R\'{e}nyi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal rectification via state-dependent two-photon dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling heat flow at the quantum level is essential for the development of next-generation thermal devices. We investigate thermal rectification in a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to two thermal baths via both single-photon (linear) and two-photon (nonlinear) exchange processes. At low temperatures, rectification arises from a state-dependent suppression of two-photon emission: when the cold bath dominates, it drives the oscillator into low-occupancy states, inhibiting emission and creating a thermal bottleneck. At higher temperatures, rectification is governed by the asymmetric scaling of higher-order moments associated with two-photon absorption and emission. We systematically explore various bath coupling configurations and identify the conditions under which nonlinear dissipation leads to directional heat flow. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on coupling an auxiliary two-level system to the oscillator, enabling effective two-photon dissipation. These results contribute to the understanding of quantum heat transport in the presence of nonlinear dissipation and may support future efforts in nanoscale thermal rectification design.</description>

      <title>Unilateral determination of causal order in a cyclic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent years have seen interest into the possibility for (classical as well as quantum) causal structures that, while remaining logically consistent, feature a cyclic causal order between events, opening intriguing possibilities for new physics. In the cyclic processes displayed so far, the global causal order is determined jointly by the operations performed by agents at each event, a feature that can be certified through the introduction of causal games and (the violation of) causal inequalities. This raises the question of whether there exist processes in which an agent acting at a single event can unilaterally determine her causal ordering with respect to some other events. We answer this question in the affirmative, by introducing a process in which any party may be put in a position to pick, on her own, any other party to lie in her future. We certify this behaviour by displaying a related causal inequality that the process allows to maximally violate.</description>

      <title>Bounded information as a foundation for quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formalize the concept that best synthesizes our intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics -- that the information carried by a system is limited -- and, from this principle, to construct the foundations of quantum theory. In our discussion, we also introduce a second important hypothesis: if a measurement closely approximates an ideal one in terms of experimental precision, the information it provides about a physical system is independent of the measurement method and, specifically, of the system's physical quantities being measured. This principle can be expressed in terms of metric properties of a manifold whose points represent the state of the system. These and other reasonable hypotheses provide the foundation for a framework of quantum reconstruction.
  The theory presented in this paper is based on a description of physical systems in terms of their statistical properties, specifically statistical parameters, and focuses on the study of estimators for these parameters. To achieve the goal of quantum reconstruction, a divide-and-conquer approach is employed, wherein the space of two discrete conjugate Hamiltonian variables is partitioned into a binary tree of nested sets. This approach naturally leads to the reconstruction of the linear and probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Resources in Perfect Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a teleportation protocol that enables perfect transmission of a qubit using a partially entangled two-qutrit quantum channel. Within our scheme, we analyze the relationship among the three key ingredients of teleportation: (i) the quantum channel, (ii) the sender's (Alice's) measurement operations, and (iii) the classical information transmitted to the receiver (Bob). Compared to Gour's protocol \cite{PRA2004}, our scheme requires less entanglement of Alice's measurement and fewer classical bits sent to Bob.Our results also show a trade-off between these two resources and derive a lower bound for their sum, quantifying their interplay in the teleportation process.</description>

      <title>Robust Control of High-dimensional Quantum Systems against Coherent and Incoherent Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toward scalable quantum computing, the control of quantum systems needs to be robust against both coherent errors induced by parametric uncertainties and incoherent errors induced by environmental decoherence. This poses significant challenges for high-dimensional systems due to the computational intensity involved in the control design process. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to improve the design efficiency. By employing the Taylor series expansion of uncertain parameters, the problem of robust control for an uncertain quantum system is reformulated as the optimal control problem of an augmented deterministic system. The Suzuki-Trotter expansion is then applied to accelerate the calculation of the system dynamics. Numerical simulations of quantum state preparation and quantum gate synthesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify robust solutions in multi-qubit systems. The enhanced efficiency effectively extends the feasibility of high-order robust control for realistic high-dimensional quantum systems with multiple error sources.</description>

      <title>Systematic improvement of the quantum approximate optimisation ansatz for combinatorial optimisation using quantum subspace expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimisation ansatz (QAOA) is one of the flagship algorithms used to tackle combinatorial optimisation on graphs problems using a quantum computer, and is considered a strong candidate for early fault-tolerant advantage. In this work, I study the enhancement of the QAOA with a generator coordinate method (GCM), and achieve systematic performances improvements in the approximation ratio and fidelity for the maximal independent set on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs. The cost-to-solution of the present method and the QAOA are compared by analysing the number of logical CNOT and $T$ gates required for either algorithm. Extrapolating on the numerical results obtained, it is estimated that for this specific problem and setup, the approach surpasses QAOA for graphs of size greater than 75 using as little as eight trial states. The potential of the method for other combinatorial optimisation problems is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A ultrabright, two-colour photon pair source based on thin-film lithium niobate for bridging visible and telecom wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and characterisation of a guided-wave, bright and highly frequency non-degenerate parametric down-conversion source in thin-film lithium niobate. The source generates photon pairs with wavelengths of 815$\,\mathrm{nm}$ and 1550$\,\mathrm{nm}$ linking the visible wavelength regime with telecommunication wavelengths. We confirm the high quality of the generated single photons by determining a value for the heralded second-order correlation function as low as $g^{(2)}_h(0) = (6.7\pm1.1)\cdot10^{-3}$. Furthermore, we achieve a high spectral brightness of 0.44$\cdot$10$^{7}$$\frac{\text{pairs}}{\text{s} \cdot \text{mW} \cdot \text{GHz}}$ which is two orders of magnitude higher than sources based on weakly guiding waveguides. The almost perfect sinc-shape and the strong agreement between the effective and nominal bandwidth highlights the success of our integrated workflow, which begins with device design and continues through precise fabrication to detailed quantum-state characterization. This comprehensive approach enables targeted optimization of the source, resulting in excellent quantum state generation. Our results set a new standard for on-chip, non-degenerate photon-pair sources and represent a crucial step towards practical, scalable quantum communication networks and photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study monitored quantum dynamics of infinite-range interacting bosonic systems in the thermodynamic limit. We show that under semiclassical assumptions, the quantum fluctuations along single monitored trajectories adopt a deterministic limit for both quantum-jump and state-diffusion unravelings, and can be exactly solved. In particular, the hierarchical structure of the equations of motion explains the coincidence of entanglement phase transitions and dissipative phase transitions found in previous finite-size numerical studies. We illustrate the findings on a Bose-Hubbard dimer and a collective spin system.</description>

We introduce a family of unique games based on groups that generalize XOR games, and show that when the group is the cyclic group of order 3, then these games correspond to a 3-labelling problem for directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Characterization of Arbitrary Order Pulse Correlations for Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations, memory effects caused by the limited bandwidth of modulators and/or other active devices can leak information about previous setting choices. Security proofs addressing this imperfection require the characterization of pulse correlations, which, in principle, can be of an arbitrary order, even unbounded. Experimentally, this is very hard (if not impossible) to achieve. Here, we solve this pressing problem by introducing a simple linear model to explain pulse correlations. In so doing, we can derive upper bounds on the correlation strength of arbitrary order from the study of the step response of the system. Importantly, this is what is needed to ensure the security of QKD in the presence of pulse correlations of unbounded length. We experimentally characterize short-range correlations and apply the proposed method to account for long-range correlations to an infinite order.</description>

      <title>Phase-Dependent Squeezing in Dual-Comb Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure phase-dependent Kerr soliton squeezing and anti-squeezing in the time-domain dualcomb interferograms generated using two independent frequency comb lasers. The signal appears as non-stationary quantum noise that varies with the fringe phase of the interferogram and dips below the shot-noise level by as much as 3.8 dB for alternating zero-crossings. The behavior arises from the periodic displacement of the Kerr squeezed comb by the coherent field of the second frequency comb, and is confirmed by a quantum noise model. These experiments support a route towards quantum-enhanced dual-comb timing applications and raise the prospect of high-speed quantum state tomography with dual-comb interferometry.</description>

      <title>Can boundary configuration be tuned to optimize directional quantum steering harvesting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the harvesting of quantum steering and its asymmetry between two static detectors locally interacting with a vacuum massless scalar field near an infinite, perfectly reflecting boundary. The detectors are arranged either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with detector $B$ assumed to have an energy gap greater than or equal to that of detector $A$. It is interesting to observe that, with increasing distance between the detectors and the boundary, the boundary tends to suppress quantum steering in one direction while enhancing it in the opposite direction. In the case of identical detectors, steering is symmetric when they are aligned parallel to the boundary. However, orthogonal alignment breaks this symmetry due to their unequal spatial proximity to the boundary. For non-identical detectors in the parallel configuration, the steering from $A$ to $B$ ($A \rightarrow B$) generally surpasses that from $B$ to $A$ ($B \rightarrow A$). In contrast, when the detectors are oriented orthogonally to the boundary, the relative strength of $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow A$ steerability depends on the interplay between the boundary effects and the detectors' energy gap difference. Across most of the parameter space, the orthogonal alignment tends to enhance $B \rightarrow A$ steering while suppressing $A \rightarrow B$ steering compared to the parallel setup. These findings suggest that boundary configurations should be flexibly adjusted according to the directional dependence of steering harvesting in order to optimize quantum information extraction.</description>

      <title>From Few to Many Emitters Cavity QED: Energy Levels and Emission Spectra From Weak to Deep-Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the properties of systems composed of $N$ two-level quantum emitters coupled to a single cavity mode, for light-matter interaction strengths ranging from the weak to the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes. Beginning with an analysis of the energy spectrum as a function of the light-matter coupling strength, we examine systems with varying numbers of emitters, from a pair to large collections, approaching the thermodynamic limit ($N \to \infty$). Additionally, we explore the emission properties of these systems under incoherent excitation of the emitters, employing a general theoretical framework for open cavity-QED systems, which is valid across all light-matter interaction regimes and preserves gauge invariance within truncated Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we study the influence of the emitter-environment interaction on the spectral properties of the system. Specifically, when each emitter interacts independently with its own reservoir, we observe the emergence of an emission peak at the cavity's resonant frequency for even values of $N$. Our analysis also clarify the evolution of the system as the number of emitters increases, ultimately converging towards an equivalent system composed of two interacting single-mode bosonic fields.</description>

      <title>Hardware-efficient quantum phase estimation via local control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for an increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Spatial Regionalization: A Hybrid Quantum Computing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has shown significant potential to address complex optimization problems; however, its application remains confined to specific problems at limited scales. Spatial regionalization remains largely unexplored in quantum computing due to its complexity and large number of variables. In this paper, we introduce the first hybrid quantum-classical method to spatial regionalization by decomposing the problem into manageable subproblems, leveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum computation. This study establishes a foundational framework for effectively integrating quantum computing methods into realistic and complex spatial optimization tasks. Our initial results show a promising quantum performance advantage for a broad range of spatial regionalization problems and their variants.</description>

      <title>Trans-dimensional Hamiltonian model selection and parameter estimation from sparse, noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput characterization often requires estimating parameters and model dimension from experimental data of limited quantity and quality. Such data may result in an ill-posed inverse problem, where multiple sets of parameters and model dimensions are consistent with available data. This ill-posed regime may render traditional machine learning and deterministic methods unreliable or intractable, particularly in high-dimensional, nonlinear, and mixed continuous and discrete parameter spaces. To address these challenges, we present a Bayesian framework that hybridizes several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques to estimate both parameters and model dimension from sparse, noisy data. By integrating sampling for mixed continuous and discrete parameter spaces, reversible-jump MCMC to estimate model dimension, and parallel tempering to accelerate exploration of complex posteriors, our approach enables principled parameter estimation and model selection in data-limited regimes. We apply our framework to a specific ill-posed problem in quantum information science: recovering the locations and hyperfine couplings of nuclear spins surrounding a spin-defect in a semiconductor from sparse, noisy coherence data. We show that a hybridized MCMC method can recover meaningful posterior distributions over physical parameters using an order of magnitude less data than existing approaches, and we validate our results on experimental measurements. More generally, our work provides a flexible, extensible strategy for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse problems under realistic experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Finite-size security analysis for quantum protocols: A Python framework using the Entropy Accumulation Theorem with graphical interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive software framework for the finite-size security analysis of quantum random number generation (QRNG) and quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, based on the Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT). Our framework includes both a Python API and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), designed to support protocol designers and experimentalists in certifying randomness and key rates under realistic, finite-resource conditions. At its core, the framework automates the construction of min-tradeoff functions via semi-definite programming and integrates them into a full entropy analysis pipeline. Users can specify device configurations, Bell-type inequalities or probability constraints, and select entropy measures such as min-entropy or von Neumann entropy. The package further provides tools for setting test parameters, computing secure randomness rates, and exploring tradeoffs between statistical confidence, protocol duration, and randomness output. We demonstrate the framework showing how users can move from theoretical constraints to practical security bounds with minimal overhead. This work contributes a reproducible, modular, and extensible platform for certifying quantum protocols under finite-size effects, significantly lowering the skill barrier to rigorous quantum cryptographic analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge of consistently updating quantum states after selective measurements in a relativistic spacetime. Standard updates along the future lightcones preserve causality but break correlations between causally disconnected parties, whereas updates along the past lightcone either imply retrocausality or do not respect the causal propagation of information. We introduce a minimal extension of multipartite states to encode subsystem-specific contextual information. This "polyperspective" formalism ensures causally consistent covariant state updates, preserves multipartite correlations, and respects conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Operator Ordering in the Relativistic Quantization and its Thermodynamic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a covariant canonical quantization for a particle in curved spacetime that tracks operator-ordering ambiguities. Parameterizing spatial and temporal ordering, we derive a Hermitian Hamiltonian with leading quantum-relativistic corrections. In a uniformly accelerated frame, we show the semiclassical heat-capacity approximation misses these effects and then develop a perturbative quantum treatment using Airy-function modes to obtain analytical first- and second-order energy shifts. Including these shifts in the partition function yields nontrivial, ordering-dependent specific-heat corrections. Numerical studies for electrons in extreme electric fields and ultra-light particles in strong gravitational fields demonstrate that these corrections become significant at intermediate temperatures. Enforcing the Tolman-Ehrenfest relation for spatial temperature variation further modulates the heat-capacity profile. Our results suggest that precision calorimetry in laser-acceleration or analogue gravity setups could probe quantum-ordering effects in relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Tunable anyonic permeability across ${\mathbb{Z}_2}$ spin liquid junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two classes of junctions in a toric code, a prototypical model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid, and study the nature of anyonic transport across them mediated by Zeeman fields. In the first class of junctions, termed potential barrier junctions, the charges sense effective static potentials and a change in the band mass. In a particular realization, while the junction is completely transparent to the electric charge, magnetic charge transmission is allowed only after a critical field strength. In the second class of junctions we stitch two toric codes with operators which do not commute at the junction. We show that the anyonic transmission gets tuned by effective pseudospin fluctuations at the junction. Using exact analytical mappings and numerical simulations, we compute charge-specific transmission probabilities. Our work, apart from uncovering the rich physical mechanisms at play in such junctions, can motivate experimental work to engineer defect structures in topologically ordered systems for tunable transport of anyonic particles.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time t=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and possibly others with Im (p) &lt; 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is tanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially short time scale, our previous results (Kui\'c, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10, 384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behaviour exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>The physics, travels, and tribulations of Ronald Wilfrid Gurney</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ronald Wilfrid Gurney is one of the lesser-known research students of the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid 1920s. Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke. With the approach of the 100th year anniversary of quantum mechanics, it is timely to commemorate the life and contributions of this somewhat forgotten physicist.</description>

      <title>Improving the lifetime of aluminum-based superconducting qubits through atomic layer etching and deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dry surface treatment combining atomic layer etching and deposition (ALE and ALD) to mitigate dielectric loss in fully fabricated superconducting quantum devices formed from aluminum thin films on silicon. The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.</description>

      <title>The influence of nitrogen doping and annealing on the silicon vacancy in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy ($V_{Si}$) in 4H-SiC at its cubic site (V2-center) has shown significant promise for quantum technologies, due to coherent spin states, the mature material system, and stable optical emission. In these SiC-based applications, doping plays a crucial role. It can be used to control the charge state of $V_{Si}$ and formation of different types of defects. Despite its importance, there has been little research on the effects of doping. In this work, we perform a study of the effects of nitrogen doping and annealing on the photoluminescence (PL), optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast, and dephasing times of ensembles of V2 in epilayers of 4H-SiC. The results show an enhancement of PL that depends on the electron irradiation dose for a given electron concentration, supported by theoretical modeling of the charge state of $V_{Si}$ in the presence of nitrogen. Nitrogen substituted for carbon is shown to very efficiently donate one electron to $V_{Si}$. We also observe that the ODMR contrast can be increased from 0.5% in low doped SiC to 1.5% by nitrogen doping of $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ and annealing at 500-600 $^{\circ}$C for 1 hour, with only a 20% decrease in PL compared to unannealed. Some of the improvement in contrast is offset by a reduction in $T_2^*$ at these doping levels, but the estimated cw ODMR shot-noise limited sensitivity is still 1.6 times higher than that of undoped, unannealed SiC.</description>

      <title>Attosecond tunneling time measurements through momentum squeezing in strong field ionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunneling of a particle through a potential barrier is a fundamental physical process and a major thought-provoking outcome of quantum physics. It is at the basis of multiple scientific and technological advances and strongly influences both the structuring and the dynamics of matter at the microscopic scale. Without a classical counterpart, it defies our intuitive perception and understanding of the motion of a particle. Thus, the temporal characterization of tunneling, typically in terms of the time spent "under the barrier", referred to as tunneling time, raises several debates and questions on its interpretation and measurability. Here we show that an electron wavepacket tunneling out of an atom through the potential barrier induced by a strong electric field, carries in its momentum profile the value of the corresponding tunneling time, in a self-probing manner. In a revisited interpretation of the attoclock setup, we view a circularly polarized light pulse as a temporal prism which maps the barrier configuration, and hence the tunneling dynamics, onto different photoelectron ejection directions. From our simulations, we find that tunneling times in the infrared regime are of the order of hundreds of attoseconds, in agreement with previous theories.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of enhancement of index of refraction (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. We analyze the modulation in the response function of probe in both first- and second-order quantization, under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of refractive index and coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</description>

      <title>Kitaev model in regular hyperbolic tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolates between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Four-body physics in low-dimensional bosons with three-body interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-channel model for bosons with the three-body interaction is proposed. Similar to the Hamiltonian describing narrow Feshbach resonance in the two-body sector, our model includes the finite-range effects of the three-body potential and is well-defined in the ultraviolet (UV). A detailed exploration of the Efimov-like effect in the fractal-dimension system of four bosons is carried out. Peculiarities of the four-body bound states and the low-energy atom-trimer scattering in one dimension are revealed.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are becoming increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, in particular, on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The application of QVAs, more especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), to schematic model simulation is examined in this work. The cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework serves as a foundation for comprehending high-spin phenomena in deformed nuclei. Using single-particle level spacings, pairing correlations, cranking (rotational) terms, and particle-number conservation, we build five increasingly complex CNS-like models. Quantum-classical hybrid procedures are used to solve these Hamiltonians after mapping them to qubit operators. Key metrics such as ground state energy, angular momentum expectation values $J_x$, and entanglement entropy are used to compare the results to exact diagonalization (ED). With variational errors typically $&lt;0.005$, our results show agreement in energy and angular momentum predictions. Notably, we find slight variances in entanglement entropy between the ED and VQE results, which are influenced by numerical precision and ansatz expressivity. These results open the door to investigating larger, more realistic CNS-type systems through more expressive ansatz and validate the use of variational quantum algorithms in modelling rotational nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of contraction map proof method for holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contraction map proof method is the commonly used method to prove holographic entropy inequalities. Existence of a contraction map corresponding to a holographic entropy inequality is a sufficient condition for its validity. But is it also necessary? In this note, we answer that question in affirmative for all linear holographic entropy inequalities with rational coefficients. We show that, generically, the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a hypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as alterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation of inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.</description>

      <title>Measures of Systems of Oscillators and Properties of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of trajectories of systems of harmonic oscillators equipped with a point, absolutely continuous or singular measure are considered in this paper. Linear flow of an infinite system of oscillators on an infinite dimensional tori in the phase space are studied. It was shown in [28] that for infinite-dimensional linear flows of a countable system of oscillators there is a new type of trajectories that is not periodic and has no transitive projection on any 4-dimensional symplectic subspace. A trajectory with this property is absent in the finite-dimensional case, it is not typical for a countably system of oscillators and it is typical for a continual one. We show that any point of a non-degenerated invariant torus is non-wandering point of the flow of a countable system of harmonic oscillators. But a point of a non-degenerated invariant torus of a flow of continual system of harmonic oscillator with absolutely continuous measure is wandering point. For the continual system of oscillators with a singular measure we obtain sufficient conditions on measure and torus for absence of transitive trajectory and non-wandering points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polygon resonators are known for their small size and high force sensitivity. We propose an analytical model to predict the mechanical quality factors (Q) of polygon perimeter modes by incorporating a stress term in the Timoshenko-Gere equation. We discuss the origin of losses and their relationship with polygon structure dimensions. Notably, we demonstrate that the torsion loss can be suppressed through the torsion angle of supporting tethers. These results offer new insights into optimizing high Q polygon resonators for cavity optomechanics, force sensing, and multimode physics of phononic structures.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits provide a versatile platform for studying quantum materials by leveraging precise microwave control and utilizing the tools of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Hybrid circuit devices incorporating novel quantum materials could also lead to new qubit functionalities, such as gate tunability and noise resilience. Here, we report experimental progress towards a transmon-like qubit made with a superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junction using exfoliated BiSbTeSe2. We present a design that enables us to systematically characterize the hybrid device, from DC transport of the S-TI-S junction, to RF spectroscopy, to full circuit QED control and measurement of the hybrid qubit. In addition, we utilize a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity to characterize material and fabrication-induced losses, thereby guiding our efforts to improve device quality.</description>

Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the false vacuum decay at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Storage properties of a quantum perceptron"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent paper "Storage properties of a quantum perceptron" [Phys. Rev. E 110, 024127] considers a quadratic constraint satisfaction problem, motivated by a quantum version of the perceptron. In particular, it derives its critical capacity, the density of constraints at which there is a satisfiability transition. The same problem was considered before in another context (classification of geometrically structured inputs, see [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 120601; Phys. Rev. E 102, 032119; J. Stat. Mech. (2021) 113301]), but the results on the critical capacity drastically differ. In this note, I substantiate the claim that the derivation performed in the quantum scenario has issues when inspected closely, I report a more principled way to perform it and I evaluate the critical capacity of an alternative constraint satisfaction problem that I consider more relevant for the quantum perceptron rule proposed by the article in question.</description>

      <title>Detection of subsurface structures with a vehicle-based atom gravity gradiometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision mobile gravity gradiometers are very useful in geodesy and geophysics. Atom gravity gradiometers (AGGs) could be among the most accurate mobile gravity gradiometers but are currently constrained by the trade-off between portability and sensitivity. Here, we present a high-sensitivity mobile AGG featuring an ultra-compact sensor head with a volume of only 94 L. In the laboratory, it achieves a sensitivity of 77 E/$\sqrt{Hz}$ (1 E=1$\times10^{-9}$/s$^2$) and a long-term stability of better than 0.5 E. We integrated the instrument in a minivan, enabling efficient mobile field surveys with excellent maneuverability in confined spaces. Using this vehicular system, we surveyed the gravitational field over a set of subsurface structures within a small wooded area, successfully resolving their structural signatures with a signal-to-noise ratio of 57 and quantifying the water depth in a reservoir with an accuracy of $\pm$0.23 m. Compared with previous observations using a CG-5 gravimeter, the superior spatial resolution inherent in gradiometry is clearly demonstrated. This work paves the way for bring AGGs to practical field applications.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the electronic wave function using deep variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel wave function partitioning method that integrates deep-learning variational Monte Carlo with ans\"atze based on generalized product functions. This approach effectively separates electronic wave functions (WFs) into multiple partial WFs representing, for example, the core and valence domains or different electronic shells. Although our ans\"atze do not explicitly include correlations between individual electron groups, we show that they accurately reproduce the underlying physics and chemical properties, such as dissociation curve, dipole moment, reaction energy, ionization energy, or atomic sizes. We identify the optimal number of core electrons and define physical core sizes for Li to Mg atoms. Our results demonstrate that core electrons can be effectively decoupled from valence electrons. We show that the core part of the WF remains nearly constant across different molecules and their geometries, enabling the transfer and reuse of the core part in WFs of more complex systems. This work provides a general framework for WF decomposition, offering potential advantages in computing and studying larger systems, and possibly paving the way for ab-initio development of effective core potentials. Though currently limited to small molecules due to scaling, we highlight several directions for extending our method it to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram demonstrating the coexistence and interplay between the intrinsic Jeans instability of self-gravitating systems and the unstable tongues of parametric resonance. The phase diagram shows that reducing the driving frequency fragments and narrows parametric resonance structures while expanding the Jeans-dominated regime. We further identify a thermal-gravity competition in the Faraday wavevector, manifested as a sharp transition when thermal energy balances mean-field interaction at low driving frequencies. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal that Faraday wave patterns exhibit high sensitivity to Jeans frequency, transitioning from parametric resonance to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases.</description>

      <title>Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the local nonfreeness, an unbiased measure of correlation between electrons at a single lattice site, can be computed as the mutual information between local natural spin orbitals. Using this concept, we prove that local electron correlations in the Hubbard model are fully classical: in the natural basis the local reduced density matrix is separable and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.</description>

      <title>Integrating Classical and Quantum Software for Enhanced Simulation of Realistic Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of quantum computing for large-scale, realistic chemical systems through the development of a new interface using a quantum circuit simulator and CP2K, a highly efficient first-principles calculation software. Quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers require Hamiltonians prepared on classical computers. Moreover, to compute forces beyond just single-point energy calculations, one- and two-electron integral derivatives and response equations are also to be computed on classical computers. Our developed interface allows for efficient evaluation of forces with the quantum-classical hybrid framework for large chemical systems. We performed geometry optimizations and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations on typical condensed-phase systems. These included liquid water, molecular adsorption on solid surfaces, and biological enzymes. In water benchmarks with periodic boundary conditions, we confirmed that the cost of preparing second-quantized Hamiltonians and evaluating forces scales almost linearly with the simulation box size. This research marks a step towards the practical application of quantum-classical hybrid calculations, expanding the scope of quantum computing to realistic and complex chemical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Chain rules for quantum R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5455</link>
      <description>arXiv:1410.5455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present chain rules for a new definition of the quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy sometimes called the "sandwiched" R\'enyi conditional entropy. More precisely, we prove analogues of the equation $H(AB|C) = H(A|BC) + H(B|C)$, which holds as an identity for the von Neumann conditional entropy. In the case of the R\'enyi entropy, this relation no longer holds as an equality, but survives as an inequality of the form $H_{\alpha}(AB|C) \geqslant H_{\beta}(A|BC) + H_{\gamma}(B|C)$, where the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ obey the relation $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1} = \frac{\beta}{\beta-1} + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}$ and $(\alpha-1)(\beta-1)(\gamma-1) &gt; 0$; if $(\alpha-1)(\beta-1)(\gamma-1) &lt; 0$, the direction of the inequality is reversed.</description>

      <title>Power-like potentials: from the Bohr-Sommerfeld energies to exact ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For one-dimensional power-like potentials $|x|^m, m &gt; 0$ the Bohr-Sommerfeld Energies (BSE) extracted explicitly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition are compared with the exact energies. It is shown that for the ground state as well as for all positive parity states the BSE are always above the exact ones contrary to the negative parity states where BSE remain above the exact ones for $m&gt;2$ but they are below them for $m &lt; 2$. The ground state BSE as the function of $m$ are of the same order of magnitude as the exact energies for linear $(m=1)$, quartic $(m=4)$ and sextic $(m=6)$ oscillators but relative deviation grows with $m$ reaching the value 4 at $m=\infty$. For physically important cases $m=1,4,6$ for the $100$th excited state BSE coincide with exact ones in 5-6 figures.
  It is demonstrated that modifying the right-hand-side of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition by introducing the so-called {\it WKB correction} $\gamma$ (coming from the sum of higher order WKB terms taken at the exact energies) to the so-called exact WKB condition one can reproduce the exact energies. It is shown that the WKB correction is small, bounded function $|\gamma| &lt; 1/2$ for all $m \geq 1$, it is slow growing with increase in $m$ for fixed quantum number, while it decays with quantum number growth at fixed $m$. For the first time for quartic and sextic oscillators the WKB correction and energy spectra (and eigenfunctions) are written explicitly in closed analytic form with high relative accuracy $10^{-9 \ -11}$ (and $10^{-6}$).</description>

      <title>Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show an area law in the mutual information for the
  maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general
  Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space
  degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good'
  approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a
  crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations
  have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and
  2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a
  corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any
  $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system,
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big),
  \end{align*}
  where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and
  $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed
  maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition
  in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega
  \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in
  1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show
  that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with
  a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to
  a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond
  dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual
  information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local
  Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Global Variational Quantum Circuits for Arbitrary Symmetric State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states that are symmetric under particle exchange play a crucial role in fields such as quantum metrology and quantum error correction. We use a variational circuit composed of global one-axis twisting and global rotations to efficiently prepare arbitrary symmetric states, i.e. any superposition of Dicke states. The circuit does not require local addressability or ancilla qubits and thus can be readily implemented in a variety of experimental platforms including trapped-ion quantum simulators and cavity QED systems. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that any $N$-qubit symmetric state can be prepared in $2N/3$ steps. We demonstrate the utility of our protocol by preparing (i) metrologically useful $N$-qubit Dicke states of up to $N = 300$ qubits in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gate steps with theoretical infidelities $1-\mathcal{F} &lt; 10^{-3}$, (ii) the $N = 9$ Ruskai codewords in $P = 4$ gate steps with $1-\mathcal{F} &lt; 10^{-4}$, and (iii) the $N = 13$ Gross codewords in $P = 7$ gate steps with $1-\mathcal{F} &lt; 10^{-4}$. Focusing on trapped-ion platforms, for the $N = 9$ Ruskai and $N = 13$ Gross codewords we estimate that the protocol achieves fidelities $\gtrsim 95\%$ in the presence of typical experimental noise levels, thus providing a pathway to the preparation of a wide range of useful highly-entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>Useful entanglement can be extracted from noisy graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster states and graph states in general offer a useful model of the stabilizer formalism and a path toward the development of measurement-based quantum computation. Their defining structure -- the stabilizer group -- encodes all possible correlations which can be observed during measurement. Those outcomes which are compatible with the stabilizer structure make error correction possible. Here, we leverage both properties to design feasible families of states that can be used as robust building blocks of quantum computation. This procedure reduces the effect of experimentally relevant noise models on the extraction of smaller entangled states from the larger noisy graph state. In particular, we study the extraction of Bell pairs from linearly extended graph states -- this has the immediate consequence for state teleportation across the graph. We show that robust entanglement can be extracted by proper design of the linear graph with only a minimal overhead of the physical qubits. This scenario is relevant to systems in which the entanglement can be created between neighboring sites. The results shown in this work may provide a mathematical framework for noise reduction in measurement-based quantum computation. With proper connectivity structures, the effect of noise can be minimized for a large class of realistic noise processes.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. These numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Achieving the ultimate quantum precision in the estimation of multiple physical parameters simultaneously is a challenge in quantum metrology due to fundamental limitations and experimental challenges in harnessing the necessary quantum resources. We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to reach Heisenberg limited sensitivity in the simultaneous estimation of two unknown phase parameters in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer by using a squeezed and a coherent state of light as input and homodyne detections at the outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond is a promising platform for quantum information processing as it can host highly coherent qubits that could allow for the construction of large quantum registers. A prerequisite for such devices is a coherent interaction between nitrogen vacancy (NV) electron spins. Entanglement between dipolar-coupled NV spin pairs has been demonstrated, but with a limited entanglement fidelity and its error sources have not been characterized. Here, we design and implement a robust, easy to implement entangling gate between NV spins in diamond and quantify the influence of multiple error sources on the gate performance. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record gate fidelity of $F=(96.0 \pm 2.5)$ % under ambient conditions. Our identification of the dominant errors paves the way towards NV-NV gates beyond the error correction threshold.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum control dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable.
  In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</description>

      <title>Concentration of quantum channels with random Kraus operators via matrix Bernstein inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we generate quantum channels with random Kraus operators to typically obtain almost twirling quantum channels and quantum expanders. To prove the concentration phenomena, we use matrix Bernstein's inequality. In this way, our random models do not utilize Haar-distributed unitary matrices or Gaussian matrices. Rather, as in the preceding research, we use unitary $t$-designs to generate mixed tenor-product unitary channels acting on $(\mathbb C^{d})^{\otimes t}$. Although our bounds in Schatten $p$-norm are valid only for $1\leq p \leq 2$, we show that they are typically almost twirling quantum channels with the tail bound proportional to $1/\mathrm{poly}(d^t)$, while such bounds were previously constants. The number of required Kraus operators was also improved by powers of $\log d$ and $t$. Such random quantum channels are also typically quantum expanders, but the number of Kraus operators must grow proportionally to $\log d$ in our case. Finally, a new non-unital model of super-operators generated by bounded and isotropic random Kraus operators was introduced, which can be typically rectified to give almost randomizing quantum channels and quantum expanders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a noise model that ensures the functioning of an echo state network employing a gate-based quantum computer for reservoir computing applications. Energy dissipation induced by amplitude damping drastically improves the short-term memory capacity and expressivity of the network, by simultaneously providing fading memory and richer dynamics. There is an ideal dissipation rate that ensures the best operation of the echo state network around $\gamma\sim$ 0.03. Nevertheless, these beneficial effects are stable as the intensity of the applied noise increases. The improvement of the learning is confirmed by emulating a realistic noise model applied to superconducting qubits, paving the way for the application of reservoir computing methods in current non-fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-spatial-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. Our results indicate a potential reduction of required data points by at least a factor of 3, while maintaining the current error level. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Conventional formulation of quantum sensing has been mostly developed in the context of local estimation, where the unknown parameter is roughly known. In contrast, global sensing, where the prior information is incomplete and the unknown parameter is only known to lie within a broad interval, is practically more engaging but has received far less theoretical attention. Available formulations of global sensing rely on adaptive Bayesian strategies requiring on-the-fly change in measurement settings, or minimizing average uncertainty yielding unsaturable bounds. Here, we provide an operationally motivated approach to global sensing for fixed but optimized settings. Our scheme yields a saturable precision bound optimizing the measurement as well as the probe preparation simultaneously. The formalism is general and computationally scalable for generic bosonic multimode Gaussian or many-particle free-fermionic quantum sensors. We illustrate the implications for Gaussian thermometry and Gaussian phase estimation by showing that the optimal measurement changes, either gradually or abruptly, from homodyne for local sensing, towards heterodyne for global sensing. In contrast, for fermionic transverse XY probes, the optimal measurement basis stays fixed independent of width.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in Classically Simulable Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operator scrambling in quantum circuits built from `super-Clifford' gates. For such circuits it was established in arXiv:2002.12824 that the time evolution of operator entanglement for a large class of many-body operators can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, including for operators with volume-law entanglement. Here we extend the scope of this formalism in two key ways. Firstly we provide evidence that these classically simulable circuits include examples of fast scramblers, by constructing a circuit for which operator entanglement is numerically found to saturate in a time $t_* \sim \mathrm{ln}(N)$ (with $N$ the number of qubits). Secondly we demonstrate that, in addition to operator entanglement, certain out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) can be classically simulated within the same formalism. As a consequence such OTOCs can be computed numerically in super-Clifford circuits with thousands of qubits, and we study several explicit examples in the aforementioned fast scrambling circuits.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of frequency-bin-encoded microwave photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distributed quantum computing network requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be implemented based on propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver. However, traveling microwave photons can be lost during the transmission, leading to the failure of information transfer. Heralding protocols can be used to detect such photon losses. In this work, we propose such a protocol and experimentally demonstrate a frequency-bin encoding method of microwave photonic modes using superconducting circuits. We deterministically encode the quantum information from a superconducting qubit by simultaneously emitting its information into two photonic modes at different frequencies, with a process fidelity of 90.4%. The frequency-bin-encoded photonic modes can be used, at the receiver processor, to detect the occurrence of photon loss. Our work thus provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a distributed quantum computing network, incorporating error detection to enhance performance and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate perfect optical nonreciprocal transmission in a hybrid optomechanical system that incorporates an atomic ensemble. By introducing complex coupling strengths between the atomic ensemble and a mechanical oscillator, nonreciprocity is induced through interference between distinct optical pathways. The nonreciprocal transmission is governed by the real and imaginary components of the coupling constants, along with the relative phase differences between the optomechanical couplings. Our analysis reveals that, with precise tuning of system parameters, such as coupling strengths, detuning, and phase differences, perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. We derive the conditions necessary for optimal nonreciprocal transmission and demonstrate its dependence on the complex nature of the coupling. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of nonreciprocal optical devices, including isolators and circulators, with potential applications in quantum communication, signal processing, and photonics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) integrate quantum computing and deep neural networks, leveraging quantum properties like superposition and entanglement to enhance machine learning algorithms. These characteristics enable QNNs to outperform classical neural networks in tasks such as quantum chemistry simulations, optimization problems, and quantum-enhanced machine learning. Despite their early success, their reliability and safety issues have posed threats to their applicability. However, due to the inherently non-classical nature of quantum mechanics, verifying QNNs poses significant challenges. To address this, we propose QCov, a set of test coverage criteria specifically designed to systematically evaluate QNN state exploration during testing, with an emphasis on superposition. These criteria help evaluate test diversity and detect underlying defects within test suites. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and QNN models validate QCov's effectiveness in reflecting test quality, guiding fuzz testing efficiently, and thereby improving QNN robustness. We also evaluate sampling costs of QCov under realistic quantum scenarios to justify its practical feasibility. Finally, the effects of unrepresentative training data distribution and parameter choice are further explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of a closed quantum system is extended with the identification of an underlying substructure in which an expanded formulation of dynamics in the Heisenberg picture is given. Between measurements a ``state point" moves in an underlying multi-dimensional complex, projective space with constant velocity determined by the quantum state vector. Following a measurement, the point changes direction and moves with new constant velocity along one of several possible new orthogonal paths, with probabilities determined by Born's Rule. A possible generalization to a Riemannian substructure is speculated upon, suggesting an unexpected interaction with the background gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use spectral hole burning to investigate spin dynamics within the electronic Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of the erbium ions in erbium-doped fibers (EDF). Conducted at ultra-low temperatures and under varying magnetic fields, our study reveals distinct changes in spin relaxation dynamics across different conditions. We identified three decay components at approximately 7 mK, with one achieving spin lifetimes of over 9 hours under optimal conditions, while two components were observed at higher temperatures. The fairly stable relative weights of the decay components across conditions suggest distinct ion populations contributing to the observed relaxation dynamics. While earlier studies struggled to account for all decay components at higher temperatures, our approach successfully models spin dynamics across all observed decay components, using a consistent set of underlying mechanisms, including spin flip-flop interactions, direct coupling to two-level systems, and Raman-type processes, and distinguishes the decay components by the strengths with which these mechanisms contribute. These results suggest EDFs' potential as a promising candidate for quantum memory applications, with further room for optimization.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two types of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in the transverse field Ising model on ensembles of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks of size $N$. These networks consist of vertices connected randomly with probability $p$ ($0&lt;p\leq 1$). Using analytical derivations and numerical techniques, we compare the characteristics of the transitions for $p&lt;1$ against the fully connected network ($p=1$). We analytically show that the overlap between the wave function after a quench and the wave function of the fully connected network after the same quench deviates by at most $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. For a DQPT defined by an order parameter, the critical point remains unchanged for all $p$. For a DQPT defined by the rate function of the Loschmidt echo, we find that the rate function deviates from the $p=1$ limit near vanishing points of the overlap with the initial state, while the critical point remains independent for all $p$. Our analysis suggests that this divergence arises from persistent non-trivial global many-body correlations absent in the $p=1$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>Tight and Robust Consecutive Measurement Theorems with Applications to Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many quantum information tasks, we encounter scenarios where information about two incompatible observables must be retrieved. A natural approach is to perform consecutive measurements, raising a key question: How does the information gained from the first measurement compare to that from both? The consecutive measurement theorem (CMT) provides a general relation between these quantities and has found applications in quantum cryptography. However, its previous formulations are often either too loose or too brittle to yield meaningful bounds. In this work, we first establish a tight CMT and apply it to achieve the best upper bounds on the quantum value of certain nonlocal games and their parallel repetitions to date. We then develop a robust CMT and explore a novel application of CMT to obtain the tightest known no-go theorem for quantum oblivious transfer. These contributions strengthen the theoretical tools for analyzing quantum advantage and have concrete implications for nonlocal games and quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</title>

Abstract: Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization</title>

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the coherent transport of one or two photons in a one-dimensional waveguide chirally coupled to a dissipative nonlinear cavity. The scattering amplitudes were derived analytically. With the assist of dissipation, we can realize an ideal optical diode at the single-photon level, i. e., the transmittance is unity from one side and zero form the other side. The working area and properties of the two-photon diode are also found. This work details the relation between the diode effect and our system parameters, especially dissipation, which may find it applications in nonreciprocal quantum devices and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST), the process of reconstructing some unknown quantum state $\hat\rho$ from repeated measurements on copies of said state, is a foundationally important task in the context of quantum computation and simulation. For this reason, a detailed characterization of the error $\Delta\hat\rho = \hat\rho-\hat\rho^\prime$ in a QST reconstruction $\hat\rho^\prime$ is of clear importance to quantum theory and experiment. In this work, we develop a fully random matrix theory (RMT) treatment of state tomography in informationally-complete bases; and in doing so we reveal deep connections between QST errors $\Delta\hat\rho$ and the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). By exploiting this connection we prove that wide classes of functions of the spectrum of $\Delta\hat\rho$ can be evaluated by substituting samples of an appropriate GUE for realizations of $\Delta\hat\rho$. This powerful and flexible result enables simple analytic treatments of the mean value and variance of the error as quantified by the trace distance $\|\Delta\hat\rho\|_\mathrm{Tr}$ (which we validate numerically for common tomographic protocols), allows us to derive a bound on the QST sample complexity, and subsequently demonstrate that said bound doesn't change under the most widely-used rephysicalization procedure. These results collectively demonstrate the flexibility, strength, and broad applicability of our approach; and lays the foundation for broader studies of RMT treatments of QST in the future.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</description>

      <title>Multimode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of reconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for reconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial transpose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot joint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively implementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are assumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-shot high-resolution spectroscopy at the single-photon-level has emerged as a promising measurement technique, enabling novel observations and evaluations that were previously challenging. This technology is particularly effective for spectroscopic applications aimed at realizing frequency-multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this study, we propose a single-shot high-resolution single-photon spectroscopy system that integrates high-resolution frequency-to-spatial mode mapping using a virtually imaged phased-array (VIPA) and high-precision spatial mode detection using a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. We experimentally demonstrated the principle of this system using weak coherent pulses with a frequency mode interval of 120 MHz. This interval closely matches the minimum frequency mode spacing of the atomic frequency comb quantum memory with the Pr$^{3+}$-ion-doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. By applying the proposed system, we expect to maximize the multiplexing capability of frequency-multiplexed quantum repeater schemes utilizing such quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerance by Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations.
  To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification.
  To utilize fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.</description>

      <title>Examples of small-time controllable Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain control in small times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of cavity effects on the decay dynamics of an open magnonic system. The Purcell effect on the magnon oscillator decay is thoroughly examined for both driven and non-driven scenarios. Analytical conditions are determined to distinguish between strong and weak coupling regimes, corresponding to oscillatory and pure decay behaviors respectively. Additionally, our theory also predicts the decay of the photon mode within the cavity-magnonic open system, demonstrating excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Our findings and methodologies can provide valuable insights for advancing research in cavity magnonic quantum control, quantum information processing, and the development of magnonic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we employ the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz to report the ground state energy of the BeH2 molecule in a geometry where strong correlation effects are significant. We consider the two most important determinants in the construction of the reference state for our ansatz. We remove redundancies in order to execute a redundancy-free calculation. In view of the currently available noisy quantum hardware, we carry out parameter optimization on a classical computer and measure the energy with optimized parameters on a quantum computer. Furthermore, in order to carry out our intended 12-qubit computation with error mitigation and post-selection on a noisy intermediate scale quantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we perform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of two-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12243 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the unoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of supercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy relative to that computed classically for the same resource-optimized problem setting.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Operators of Dirac's theory with mass and axial chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac equation with mass and axial chemical potential is solved analytically obtaining the mode spinors and corresponding projection operators giving the spectral representations of the principal conserved operators. In this framework, the odd partner of the Pryce spin operator is defined for the first time showing how these operators may be combined for defining the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators of Dirac's theory of massive fermions either in the free case or in the presence of the axial chemical potential. The quantization procedure is applied in both these cases obtaining two distinct operator algebras in which the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators take canonical forms. In this approach statistical operators with independent particle and antiparticle vortical chemical potentials may be constructed.</description>

      <title>Studying Maximal Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to test quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By computing the spin correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced via photon-gluon fusion, we find that longitudinally polarized photons produce maximal entanglement at leading order, while transversely polarized photons generate significant entanglement near the threshold and in the ultra-relativistic regime. Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality. This study extends entanglement measurements to the EIC, presenting new opportunities to explore the interplay of quantum information phenomena and hadronic physics in the EIC era.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase diagram of the Quantum Ising model with Cluster Interaction Under Noisy and Noiseless Driven field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</description>

      <title>QISCIT: A validated concept inventory assessment for quantum information science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information science (QIS) is a critical interdisciplinary field that requires a well-educated workforce in the near future. Numerous researchers and educators have been actively investigating how to best educate and prepare such a workforce. An open issue has been the lack of a validated tool to asses QIS understanding without requiring college-level math. In this paper, we present the systematic development and content validation of a new assessment instrument called the Quantum Information Science Concept Introductory Test (QISCIT). With feedback from 11 QIS experts, we have developed and validated a 31-item version of QISCIT that covers concepts like quantum states, quantum measurement, qubits, entanglement, coherence and decoherence, quantum gates and computing, and quantum communication. In addition to openly sharing our new concept inventory, we discuss how introductory QIS instructors can use it in their courses.</description>
