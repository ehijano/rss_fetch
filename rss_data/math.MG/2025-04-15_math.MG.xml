      <title>Affine Logarithmic HLS and Beckner-Type Logarithmic Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two limiting cases ($\alpha\rightarrow n$ and $\alpha\rightarrow 0 $) of the recent affine HLS inequalities by Haddad and Ludwig. As $\alpha\rightarrow n$, the affine logarithmic HLS inequality is established, which is stronger than the logarithmic HLS inequality by Carlen and Loss from 1992 and Beckner from 1993. As $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, an affine version of Beckner's logarithmic Sobolev inequality is established, which is also a limiting case of the affine fractional $L^2$ Sobolev inequalities. The affine logarithmic Sobolev inequality is stronger than the original version by Beckner from 1995.</description>

      <title>Real-rooted integer polynomial enumeration algorithms and interlacing polynomials via linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the algorithms of Robinson, Smyth, and McKee--Smyth to enumerate all real-rooted integer polynomials of a fixed degree, where the first few (at least three) leading coefficients are specified. Additionally, we introduce new linear programming algorithms to enumerate all feasible interlacing polynomials of a given polynomial that comes from a certain family of real-rooted integer polynomials. These algorithms are further specialised for the study of real equiangular lines, incorporating additional number-theoretic constraints to restrict the enumeration. Our improvements significantly enhance the efficiency of the methods presented in previous work by the authors.</description>

      <title>Capillary Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The result of Guan and Ma (Invent. Math. 151 (2003)) states that if $\phi^{-1/k} : \mathbb{S}^n \to (0,\infty)$ is spherically convex, then $\phi$ arises as the $\sigma_k$ curvature (the $k$-th elementary symmetric function of the principal radii of curvature) of a strictly convex hypersurface. In this paper, we establish an analogous result in the capillary setting in the half-space for $\theta\in(0,\pi/2)$: if $\phi^{-1/k} : \mathcal{C}_{\theta} \to (0,\infty)$ is a capillary function and spherically convex, then $\phi$ is the $\sigma_k$ curvature of a strictly convex capillary hypersurface.</description>

      <title>$p$-Poincar\'e inequalities and capacity upper bounds on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we prove that a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy satisfies the chain condition, the volume regular condition with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Phi$, and that both the Poincar\'e inequality and the capacity upper bound with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Psi$ hold if and only if $$\frac{1}{C}\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^p\le\frac{\Psi(R)}{\Psi(r)}\le C\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^{p-1}\frac{\Phi(R)}{\Phi(r)}\text{ for any }r\le R.$$ In particular, given any pair of doubling functions $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ satisfying the above inequality, we construct a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy on which all the above conditions are satisfied. As a direct corollary, we prove that a metric measure space is $d_h$-Ahlfors regular and has $p$-walk dimension $\beta_p$ if and only if $$p\le\beta_p\le d_h+(p-1).$$ Our proof builds on the Laakso-type space theory, which was recently developed by Murugan (arXiv:2410.15611).</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Non-smooth paths having unit speed with respect to the Kobayashi metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the question of whether a non-constant absolutely continuous path can be reparametrised as being unit speed with respect to the Kobayashi metric. Even when the answer is "Yes," which isn't always the case, its proof involves some subtleties. We answer the above question and discuss a small application to Kobayashi geometry.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to mass transference principle and large intersection property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass transference principle, discovered by Beresnevich and Velani [Ann Math (2), 2006], is a landmark result in Diophantine approximation that allows us to obtain the Hausdorff measure theory of $\limsup$ set. Another important tool is the notion of large intersection property, introduced and systematically studied by Falconer [J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2), 1994]. The former mainly focuses on passing between full (Lebesgue) measure and full Hausdorff measure statements, while the latter transfers full Hausdorff content statement to Hausdorff dimension. From this perspective, the proofs of the two results are quite similar but often treated in different ways.
  In this paper, we establish a general mass transference principle from the viewpoint of Hausdorff content, aiming to provide a unified proof for the aforementioned results. More precisely, this principle allows us to transfer the Hausdorff content bounds of a sequence of open sets $E_n$ to the full Hausdorff measure statement and large intersection property for $\limsup E_n$. One of the advantages of our approach is that the verification of the Hausdorff content bound does not require the construction of Cantor-like subset, resulting in a much simpler proof. As an application, we provide simpler proofs for several mass transference principles.</description>

      <title>On concentric fractal spheres and spiral shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dimension-theoretic properties of concentric topological spheres, which are fractal sets emerging both in pure and applied mathematics. We calculate the box dimension and Assouad spectrum of such collections, and use them to prove that fractal spheres cannot be shrunk into a point at a polynomial rate. We also apply these dimension estimates to quasiconformally classify certain spiral shells, a generalization of planar spirals in higher dimensions. This classification also provides a bi-H\"older map between shells, and constitutes an addition to a general programme of research proposed by J. Fraser.</description>

      <title>Measure and dimension theory of permeable sets and its applications to fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study {\it permeable} sets. These are sets \(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) which have the property that each two points \(x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d\) can be connected by a short path \(\gamma\) which has small (or even empty, apart from the end points of \(\gamma\)) intersection with \(\Theta\). We investigate relations between permeability and Lebesgue measure and establish theorems on the relation of permeability with several notions of dimension. It turns out that for most notions of dimension each subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) of dimension less than \(d-1\) is permeable. We use our permeability result on the Nagata dimension to characterize permeability properties of self-similar sets with certain finiteness properties.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>

      <title>On the $W$-entropy and Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and the monotonicity and rigidity theorem of the $W$-entropy for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>
