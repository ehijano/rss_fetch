      <title>Multi-temperature atomic ensemble: nonequilibrium evolution after ultrafast electronic excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser radiation or beams of fast charged particles primarily excite the electronic system of a solid target driving it transiently out of thermal equilibrium. Apart from the nonequilibrium between the electrons and atoms, each of the subsystems may themselves be far from equilibrium. We demonstrate that the transient state of the atomic system may be tracked with the generalized temperature approach in the configuration and momentum subspaces. It is shown that the definition of the kinetic temperature of atoms in the momentum subspace is unaffected by the excitation of the electronic system. We derive an expression for the configurational atomic temperature when the electronic temperature differs from the atomic one, applicable to the electronic-temperature-dependent interatomic potentials (such as ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations). It is revealed that upon ultrafast irradiation, the atomic system of a solid exists temporarily in a multi-temperature state: separate equilibria in the momentum and configurational subspaces. Complete equilibration between the various atomic temperatures takes place at longer timescales, forming the energy equipartition. Based on these results, we propose a formulation of multi-temperature heat transport equations.</description>

      <title>Determining Domain of Machine Learning Models using Kernel Density Estimates: Applications in Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the domain of applicability of a machine learning model is essential to ensuring accurate and reliable model predictions. In this work, we develop a new approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful designation of in-domain versus out-of-domain when applied across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between a test and training data point in feature space by using kernel density estimation and shows that this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on established chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that the normalization method in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalization of unitary symmetry to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized symmetries for novel physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Predicting edge-localized monovacancy defects in zigzag graphene nanoribbons from Floquet quasienergy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prescribe a theoretical framework aiming at predicting the position of monovacancy defects at the edges of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using Floquet-Bloch formalism, which can be experimentally observed through time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES). Our methodology involves an in-depth investigation of the Floquet quasienergy band spectrum influenced by light with varying polarization across a range of frequencies. Particularly under the influence of circularly polarized light with a frequency comparable to the bandwidth of the system, our findings suggest a promising approach for locating monovacancy defects at either edge, a challenge that proves intricate to predict from the ARPES spectrum of ZGNRs with monovacancy defects. This has been achieved by analyzing the orientation of the Floquet edge state and the appearance of new Dirac points in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The real-world applications of these captivating characteristics underscore the importance and pertinence of our theoretical framework, paving the way for additional exploration and practical use. Our approach, employing the Floquet formalism, is not limited to monovacancy-type defects; rather, it can be expanded to encompass various types of vacancy defects.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhancements and entropic constraints to Boundary Time Crystals as sensors of AC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Quadratic dispersion relations in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound of dynamic critical exponents in critical frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic critical exponent $z$ characterizes the finite-size gap in gapless quantum many-body systems. We establish a rigorous lower bound $z \geq 2$ for frustration-free Hamiltonians on any lattice in any spatial dimension, given that their ground state exhibits a power-law decaying correlation function. This bound applies to representative classes of frustration-free Hamiltonians, including Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians, which are in one-to-one correspondence to Markov chains with locality, as well as parent Hamiltonians of critical projected entangled pair states with either a unique ground state or topologically degenerate ground states, and Hamiltonians with a plane-wave ground state.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>
