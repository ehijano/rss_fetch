      <title>All Loop Scattering As A Sampling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to turn the flip of a coin into a random variable whose expected value equals a scattering amplitude? We answer this question by constructing a numerical algorithm to evaluate curve integrals - a novel formulation of scattering amplitudes - by a Monte Carlo strategy. To achieve a satisfactory accuracy we take advantage of tropical importance sampling. The crucial result is that the sampling procedure can be realized as a stochastic process on surfaces which can be simulated efficiently on a computer. The key insight is to let go of the Feynman-bias that amplitudes should be presented as a sum over diagrams, and instead re-arrange the sum as suggested by a dual triangulation of curve integrals. We attach an implementation of this algorithm as an ancillary file, which we have used to evaluate amplitudes for the massive $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)^3$ theory in $D=2$ space-time dimensions, up to 10-loops. Interestingly, we observe experimentally that the number of sample points required to achieve a fixed accuracy remains significantly smaller than what the number of diagrams would suggest. Finally we propose an extension of our method which is inspired by ideas from artificial intelligence. We use the stochastic process to define a parametrization for a space of distributions, where we formulate importance sampling for an arbitrary curve integrand as a convex optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Fine Spectrum from Crude Analytic Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic line defect in the $O(N)$ model gives rise to a non-trivial one-dimensional defect conformal field theory of theoretical and experimental value. This model is considered here in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and the full spectrum of defect operators with dimensions close to one, two and three at order $\varepsilon$ is presented. The spectrum of several classes of operators of dimension close to four and operators of large charge are also discussed. Analytic bootstrap techniques are used extensively, and efficient tools to deal with the unmixing of nearly degenerate operators are developed. Integral identities are also incorporated, and it is shown that they lead to constraints on some three-point function coefficients and anomalous dimensions to order $\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Decomposition in 2d non-invertible gaugings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend decomposition to 2d QFT's with a gauged $\text{Rep}(H)$ symmetry category for $H$ a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra with $\text{Rep}(G)$ trivially-acting and $\text{Vec}(\Gamma)$ the remaining symmetry, for $G,\Gamma$ finite groups. We check our extension by explicitly computing partition functions, and by verifying that previous results arise as special cases. Then, drawing from these computations, we formulate a plausible decomposition conjecture for the even more general case of $\text{Rep}(H'')$ trivially-acting and $\text{Rep}(H')$ the remaining symmetry, for $H',H''$ Hopf algebras, not necessarily associated with groups.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction, Paramagnetic Anisotropic Plasma, IR Log-Gravitational-DBI Renormalization and $G_2$-Structure Induced (Almost) Contact 3-Structures in Hot Strongly Magnetic MQCD at Intermediate Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After obtaining the flavor $D6$-brane gauge fields/their fluctuations in the type IIA dual of T&gt;T_c QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling (via the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift's ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections) in the absence/presence of a strong magnetic field, we compute the photoproduction spectral function and get a nice agreement with gauged supergravity backgrounds arXiv:2204.00024 [hep-th]. We demonstrate from the EoS that the holographic dual, in principle, could correspond to several $T&gt;T_c$ scenarios: stable wormhole, stable wormhole transitioning via a smooth crossover to dark energy as the universe cools, and a paramagnetic pressure/energy-anisotropic plasma. Given that $T&gt;T_c$ QGP is expected to be paramagnetic, see Bali et al '14, the third possibility appears to be the preferred one. We also show that it is not possible that the anisotropic plasma leads to the formation of a compact star. IR renormalization of the DBI action requires a boundary Log-det-Ricci-tensor counter term. {\it Noting (i) photoproduction spectral function, speed of sound, etc. determined from gauge field fluctuations receiving ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrections, if complexified, include a non-analytic-complexified gauge-coupling dependence, and correspond to Contact 3-Structures; (ii) pressure/energy density, etc. determined from world-volume gauge fields and not ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected, if complexified, are analytic in the complexified gauge coupling, and correspond to Almost Contact 3-Structures (AC3S) both induced from the $G_2$ structure of a closed seven-fold, we conjecture (i) the lack of $N$-path connectedness in the parameter space associated with AC3S and C3S arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th] to be equivalent to that gauge field fluctuations can not be finite, and (zero-instanton sector) ${\cal O}(R^4)$ non-renormalized gauge fields produce ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected gauge fluctuation; (ii) C3S--UV--&gt; AC3S.</description>

      <title>Quasi Q-Balls in massless scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long-term evolution of radiating quasi-Q-balls in 1+1 dimensional models without mass threshold. Two different models are considered, the model with a rational modification of the usual Q-ball sextic potential and the model of a Q-ball in a box with outgoing boundary conditions. We find that the outgoing boundary conditions modify the angular frequency of quasi-Q-balls which becomes complex-valued. The quasi-Q-balls decay initially very similarly, but in the last stage quasi-Q-balls in a box become linear resonances, whereas in the rationally modified model, they decay according to some power law.</description>

      <title>Feynman integrals at large loop order and the $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 18 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we extrapolate the value of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theories on quantum Minkowski spaces: $\rho$ versus $\kappa$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\rho$-Minkowski space-time, a Lie-algebraic deformation of the usual Minkowski space-time is considered. A star-product realization of this quantum space-time together with the characterization of the deformed Poincar\'e symmetry acting on it are presented. It is shown that appearance of UV/IR mixing is expected already in scalar field theories on $\rho$-Minkowski. Classical and one-loop features of a typical gauge theory on this quantum space-time are presented and critically compared to the situation for $\kappa$-Minkowski.</description>

      <title>Long-range interaction of kinks in higher-order polynomial models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotic estimates of the interaction forces between kink and antikink in a family of field-theoretic models with two vacua in (1+1)-dimensional space-time. In our study we consider a new class of soliton solutions previously found in our paper [Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 165 (2022) 112805]. We focus on the case of kinks having one exponential and one power-law asymptotics. We show that if the kink and antikink are faced each other with long-range tails, the force of attraction between them at large separations demonstrates a power-law decay with the distance. We also performed numerical simulations to measure the interaction force and obtained good agreement between the experimental values and theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian integrable systems from constant non-invertible solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions ($R$-matrices) by Baxterizing constant non-invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent). They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians written in terms of the SUSY generators. As particular examples we Baxterize the $4\times 4$ constant non-invertible solutions of Hietarinta leading to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Apart from being non-hermitian, many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time-Order-Correlators in Holographic EPR pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) for quantum fields in a holographic framework describing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. We compute the four-point and six-point OTOCs using the gravity dual, represented by the string worldsheet theory in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. These correlators quantify the rate at which information is scrambled, leading to the disentanglement of the EPR pair. We demonstrate consistency between two approaches for calculating OTOCs: the holographic influence functional on worldsheets perturbed by shock waves, and the worldsheet scattering in the eikonal approximation. We show that the OTOCs exhibit an initial phase of exponential growth, with six-point correlators indicating a marginally longer scrambling time compared to four-point correlators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a contribution to the memorial edition devoted to Professor Vladislav Gavrilovich Bagrov, who was my official adviser from the beginning of undergraduate period to the end of Ph.D. The text includes a mentioning of two my publications in Izvestia VUZov Fisica (Russian Physics Journal), where Vladislav Gavrilovich served as an Editor.
  The rest of this paper is based on the recent lectures about decoupling in quantum gravity, given in ICTP-SAIFR in Sao Paulo and at the school ``Estate Quantistica'' in Scalea, Italy. After a brief and mainly qualitative review of the decoupling theorem in semiclassical gravity and the scalar fourth-derivative model of Antoniadis and Mottola, we explain what is the expected result for the physical beta functions in fourth-derivative quantum gravity and what should remain from these beta functions in the IR.</description>

      <title>Constructing noncommutative black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity, focusing on spherically symmetric black hole geometries. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the Moyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at each order in the deformation parameter $\Theta$. Working systematically to second order in $\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of four-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions, including scenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type black holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we explore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some symmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature invariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons in Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists introduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can decouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in the charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples, our approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating short-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational settings. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields, offering a broad framework for future studies of NC effects in classical solutions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Density matrices in quantum field theory: Non-Markovianity, path integrals and master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density matrices are powerful mathematical tools for the description of closed and open quantum systems. Recently, methods for the direct computation of density matrix elements in scalar quantum field theory were developed based on thermo field dynamics (TFD) and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this article, we provide a more detailed discussion of these methods and derive expressions for density matrix elements of closed and open systems. At first, we look at closed systems by discussing general solutions to the Schr\"odinger-like form of the quantum Liouville equations in TFD, showing that the dynamical map is indeed divisible, deriving a path integral-based expression for the density matrix elements in Fock space, and explaining why perturbation theory enables us to use the last even in situations where all initial states in Fock space are occupied. Subsequently, we discuss open systems in the same manner after tracing out environmental degrees of freedom from the solutions for closed systems. We find that, even in a general basis, the dynamical map is not divisible, which renders the dynamics of open systems non-Markovian. Finally, we show how the resulting expressions for open systems can be used to obtain quantum master equations, and comment on the artificiality of time integrals over density matrices that usually appear in many other master equations in the literature but are absent in ours.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{I}$-extremization with baryonic charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an entropy function for AdS$_4$ BPS black holes in M-theory with general magnetic charges, resolving in particular a long-standing puzzle about baryonic charges. The entropy function is constructed from a gravitational block defined solely in terms of topological data of the internal manifold. We show that the entropy of twisted black holes can always be reformulated as an $\mathcal{I}$-extremization problem -- even in cases where existing large-$N$ field theory computations fail to provide an answer. Furthermore, we correctly reproduce the entropy for a class of known black holes with purely baryonic magnetic charges. Our results offer both a conjecture for the general gravitational block for AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory and a prediction for the large-$N$ limit of several partition functions whose saddle points have yet to be found.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the logarithmic temperature corrections to the thermodynamic entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter (dS) black hole by computing a one-loop contribution within the path integral framework in the near-horizon limit. Due to the presence of three horizons, the extremal limit of a charged dS black hole is uniquely intriguing and remarkably different from its flat and AdS counterparts. In the near-horizon limit, there are three distinct extremal limits known as cold, Nariai, and ultracold configurations, each corresponding to a different product geometry structure involving AdS$_2$, dS$_2$ and Mink$_2$ respectively, where all of them contain a $S^2$. We compute the tensor zero modes of the Lichnerowicz operator acting on linearized metric perturbations for the cold and Nariai extremal limits which are associated with near-horizon AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ asymptotic symmetries. While the path integral over these zero modes results in an infrared divergence within the one-loop approximation to the partition function, we regulate the divergence by introducing a small, finite temperature perturbative correction to the extremal geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractonic matter with dipole symmetry can be coupled to a two-index symmetric tensor gauge field. In this work, we show that this symmetric tensor field, along with other related generalized Maxwell theories, can be consistently coupled to curved backgrounds in a covariant and gauge-invariant way by reformulating dipole symmetry using conventional vector gauge fields. We identify a family of curved geometries where global dipole symmetry is preserved and derive energy-momentum conservation laws as Ward identities associated with background diffeomorphisms. Our results pave the way for future extensions, including generalizations to higher-order multipole theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a prescription for minimally coupling massive matter to JT gravity with either sign of cosmological constant directly in its formulation as a topological BF theory. This coupling takes the form of a `Wilson spool,' originally introduced in the context of three-dimensional gravity. The Wilson spool expresses the exact one-loop partition function as the integral over a Wilson loop operator. We construct the spool by considering the partition function of a massive scalar field on Euclidean dS$_2$ and on Euclidean AdS$_2$. We discuss its extension to other geometries (including the `trumpet' and conical defect geometries) and its relation to the three-dimensional spool through dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>A BBGKY-like Hierarchy for Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Hamiltonian method of constructing BBGKY-like hierarchies for quantum field theories. With suitable choices, our method creates a hierarchical system of evolution equations for the k-th order reduced density matrices. These equations can be closed at finite order using methods developed for the classical BBGKY hierarchy to give non-perturbative approximations for the full quantum equations of motion. Classical observables can then be numerically computed from these approximate equations, providing an analytically tractable method of modeling high-energy environments where quantum effects play a pronounced role.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic characteristics of two horizons coexistence region in 4D-EGB spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of the coexistence region of two horizons in the charged 4-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) spacetime. Initially, we apply the universal first law of thermodynamics to derive the corresponding thermodynamic quantities for the coexistence region between the black hole event horizon and the cosmological event horizon, subject to the relevant boundary conditions. Next we examine the thermal properties of the thermodynamic system described by these equivalent quantities. Our analysis reveals that the peak of the heat capacity as a function of temperature exhibits characteristics similar to those observed in a paramagnetic system under specific conditions. We further conclude that, under certain conditions, the heat capacity mirrors that of a two-level system formed by two horizons with distinct temperatures. By comparing the heat capacity of the 4D-EGB spacetime's equivalent thermodynamic system with that of a two-level system defined by the two horizons in the spacetime, we can estimate the number of microscopic degrees of freedom at the two horizons. This findings sheds light on the quantum properties of de Sitter (dS) spacetime with two horizon interfaces and offers a novel approach to exploring the quantum properties of black holes and dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

Abstract: We present a new exact solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations which represents a rotating black hole with both electric and magnetic charges immersed in a universe which itself is also rotating and magnetized, i.e. the dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole in a Melvin-swirling universe. We show that the solution is completely regular and free of any type of singularity; then we analyze its physical properties, such as the ergoregions and the shape of the event horizons. Finally we present the extremal near horizon geometry of the metric and study its entropy via the Kerr/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensions of equivalent representations of gravity are discussed in the metric-affine framework. First, we focus on: (i) General Relativity, based upon the metric tensor whose dynamics is given by the Ricci curvature scalar $R$; (ii) the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, based on tetrads and spin connection whose dynamics is given by the torsion scalar $T$; (iii) the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, formulated with respect to both the metric tensor and the affine connection and characterized by the non-metric scalar $Q$ with the role of gravitational field. They represent the so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity, because, even if based on different frameworks and different dynamical variables, such as curvature, torsion, and non-metricity, they express the same gravitational dynamics. Starting from this framework, we construct their extensions with the aim to study possible equivalence. We discuss the straightforward extension of General Relativity, the $f(R)$ gravity, where $f(R)$ is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar. With this paradigm in mind, we take into account $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ extensions showing that they are not equivalent to $f(R)$. Dynamical equivalence is achieved if boundary terms are considered, that is $f(T-\tilde{B})$ and $f(Q-B)$ theories. The latter are the extensions of Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity and Symmetric Teleparallel of General Relativity, respectively. We obtain that $f(R)$, $f(T-\tilde{B})$, and $f(Q-B)$ form the Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity. The aim is to show that also if dynamics are equivalent, foundations of theories of gravity can be very different.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Modified Entropic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking into account the temperature corrections of the energy equipartition law for the bits of information that are coarse-grained on the holographic screen leads to a modification of Einstein's gravitational field equations. In the very high-temperature limit, which corresponds to strong gravitational fields, the modified gravitational equations reduce to the standard Einstein equations of general relativity, but in the low-temperature limit, which corresponds to the weak gravity regime, the modified equations show significant deviations from the standard Einstein equations. We solve the modified Einstein equations for the FRW metric and obtain the modified Friedmann equations. We see that the Friedmann equations obtained with this approach agree with the Friedmann equations previously obtained from the thermodynamic corrections of classical Newtonian mechanics. Using the modified Friedmann equations for a flat universe, we investigate the implications of our modified entropic cosmology (MEC) model. We show that our model can explain the dynamics of the universe without requiring any kind of dark energy. Using the Pantheon supernovae dataset, BAO data, Planck 2018 CMB data, and SH0ES measurements for $H_0$, we test the MEC model against observations. We will see that MEC fits the observational data better than the standard cosmological model of $\Lambda$CDM. We also see that our model can successfully solve the $H_0$ tension that challenges the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic inflation within the single-field model featuring an intermediate scale factor. Our analysis reveals that the anisotropic nature of the Friedmann equations in this framework affects the slow-roll parameters, which in turn influence key perturbation parameters. Using a numerical approach, we derive constraints on the intermediate parameter $\beta$ and the anisotropic parameter $c$. Our results show that the model is consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO data at $68\%$ CL, for $0.84&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.34&lt;c&lt;27.7$. At $95\%$ CL the consistency holds for $0.77&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.17&lt;c&lt;28.9$. The model is also consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK18+BAO data, for $0.91&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $8.00&lt;c&lt;27.4$ (at $68\%$ CL), and $0.88&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.40&lt;c&lt;28.8$ (at $95\%$ CL). Additionally, we examine the reheating phase using these constraints on constraints on $\beta$ and $c$ and determine the observationally consistent ranges for the number of e-folds and the temperature during the reheating phase.</description>

Abstract: With the help of a semi-classical kinetic theory, a new collision kernel is proposed, which simultaneously conserves the energy-momentum tensor and the spin tensor of a relativistic fluid of spin-1/2 particles irrespective of the frame and matching conditions, even when relaxation time is momentum dependent. The relativistic Boltzmann's equation is solved using this new collision kernel to obtain the expressions of the transport coefficients with general definitions for the frame and matching conditions. The results indicate the expected existence of Barnett-like effect and the non-existence of Einstein--de-Haas-like effects.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark origin of neutrino masses with oscillation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown to date. One popular idea involves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter, described as fields or particles with masses $m_\phi \ll 10\,\mathrm{eV}$. Due to the large phase-space number density, this type of dark matter exists in coherent states and can be effectively described by an oscillating classical field. As a result, neutrino mass-squared differences undergo field-induced interference in spacetime, potentially generating detectable effects in oscillation experiments. We demonstrate that if $m_\phi\gg 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the mechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations, which suppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities as a function of neutrino propagation distance in a model-independent way, thereby ruling out this regime. Furthermore, by analyzing data from the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), a benchmark long-baseline reactor experiment, we show that the hypothesis of a dark origin for the neutrino masses is disfavored for $m_\phi \ll 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, compared to the case of constant mass values in vacuum. This result holds at more than the 4$\sigma$ level across different datasets and parameter choices. The mass range $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$ can be further tested in current and future oscillation experiments by searching for time variations (rather than periodicity) in oscillation parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M&gt;1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we study the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within an effective field theory framework. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at one-loop level. As a proof of the weak gravity conjecture, we show that these quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality of charged black holes. It is important to note that our results are model-independent and have predictive capacities.</description>

      <title>Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Focusing on different relativistic dark matter distributions with an inner density spike, we analyze the effect of the dark matter halo on the topology and properties of the accretion flow. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution. Since the dominant contribution to the disk luminosity for compact and massive halo comes from the inner region of the accretion disk, our analysis suggests that luminosity measurement can indeed be useful to probe the exact nature of the dark matter density spike.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups into products of coadjoint orbits. After reviewing the known facts in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ we initiate a similar study for $\mathrm{SO}$ and $\mathrm{Sp}$ cases. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <title>Running Coupling for Holographic QCD with Heavy and Light Quarks: Isotropic case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the running coupling constant in holographic models supported by Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action for heavy and light quarks. To obtain the dependence of the running coupling constant $\alpha$ on temperature and chemical potential we impose boundary conditions on the dilaton field that depend on the position of the horizon. We use two types of boundary conditions: a simple boundary condition with the dilaton field vanishing at the horizon and a boundary condition that ensures an agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between quarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the 1st order phase transitions in $(\mu,T)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary conditions for light and heavy quarks. At these phase transitions, the function $\alpha$ undergoes jumps depending on temperature and chemical potential. We also show that for the second boundary conditions the running coupling decreases with a temperature increase, and the dependence on temperature and chemical potential both for light and heavy quarks is actually specified in QGP phase by functions of one variable, demonstrating in this sense auto-model behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has given proof and evidence that BPS states in local Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be described and counted by exponential networks on the punctured plane, with the help of a suitable non-abelianization map to the mirror curve. This provides an appealing elementary depiction of moduli of special Lagrangian submanifolds, but so far only a handful of examples have been successfully worked out in detail. In this note, we exhibit an explicit correspondence between torus fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb C^2\subset\mathbb C^3$ and anomaly free exponential networks attached to the quadratically framed pair of pants. This description realizes an interesting, and seemingly novel, "age decomposition" of linear partitions. We also provide further details about the networks' perspective on the full D-brane moduli space.</description>

      <title>Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et al. introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in a Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar field with a vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector and scalar interactions, although the details are largely different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimensions and not in higher dimensions, regardless of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the r\^ole of spatial random disorder and find a simple explanation of how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to a strange metal by changing the self-energies of the involved bosons and fermions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review the fundamental aspects of ${\cal N} = 1$ supergravity (SUGRA) and employ the chiral formalism to describe spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ fermions. Armed with this, we analyze the discrete symmetries of the graviton in the context of linearized gravity (LG) and Rarita-Schwinger (RS) fields, which include the description of the gravitino. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of the chiral formalism in classifying Lorentz and CPT-violating terms in RS theories, extending these models by including Lorentz-violating operators, as has been done in LG.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}({\cal N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model; (ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin multiplets and an effective action generating the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl anomaly; and (iii) $\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.</description>

Abstract: We follow up on our proposal for dressing factors for the mixed-flux $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ background presented in arXiv:2402.11732. We discuss in detail the analytic properties of the dressing factors in the string and mirror kinematics for fundamental massive particles and bound states. We prove that the dressing factors are unitary and CP-invariant in the string kinematics, parity invariant in the mirror, and solve the crossing equations in both kinematics. In the limit of pure Ramond-Ramond flux they reduce to the known ones. Finally, we present their expansion at strong tension, as well as in the (small-RR-flux) relativistic limit, finding agreement with the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study inhomogeneous Hamiltonians in two-dimensional conformal field theories within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence by relating them to two-dimensional curved backgrounds. We propose a classification of inhomogeneous Hamiltonians based on the Virasoro coadjoint orbit. The corresponding bulk dual geometries are described by the generalized Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados solutions, for which we introduce a generalized Roberts mapping to facilitate their study. Our classification provides previously underexplored classes of deformations, offering fresh insights into their holographic properties. Revisiting the well-known example of the M$\ddot{\text{o}}$bius Hamiltonian, we establish a connection to the 3D C-metric, which describes three-dimensional accelerating solutions. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to KdV-type asymptotic boundary conditions, revealing a broader class of solvable inhomogeneous Hamiltonians that are not linear combinations of Virasoro charges but instead involve KdV charges.</description>

      <title>One-loop Renormalization of BPS String Masses in Pseudo-anomalous Heterotic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compactification of heterotic string on a Calabi-Yau threefold can lead to a four-dimensional low-energy effective theory which contains a $U(1)$ gauge theory which is pseudo-anomalous, meaning that the fermion content is anomalous, but that the fermion anomaly is cancelled by a four-dimensional version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism involving a shift of the model-independent axion field. It is also well known that a field-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos like term is induced at one-loop in string perturbation theory in such compactifications and that this leads to a mass for the $U(1)$ gauge field. Explicit one-loop computations of the mass shifts of massless charged scalars and fermions implied by this mechanism were originally carried out in the 1980's and have been revisited more recently using techniques of string field theory and super Riemann surfaces. We consider such theories further compactified on a circle of radius $R$. There is then an infinite tower of BPS states with winding and momenta on the circle. BPS strings which wind the circle can, at large $R$, be viewed as macroscopic or cosmic strings in four spacetime dimensions, or, at generic $R$, as BPS states in three dimensions. We compute the one-loop mass renormalization of such states and show that it is nonzero and proportional to their pseudo-anomalous $U(1)$ charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of codimension one defects in free scalar field theory, with particular emphasis on line defects in two-dimensions. These defects are generically non-conformal, but include conformal and topological defects as special cases. Our analysis is based on the interplay between two complementary descriptions, the first involving matching conditions imposed on fields and their derivatives across the defect, and the second on the resummation of perturbation theory in terms of renormalized defect couplings. Using either description as appropriate we compute a variety of observables: correlators of fields in the presence of such defects; the defect anomalous dimension; multiple defects and their fusion; canonical quantization and instabilities; ring shaped defects with application to the g-theorem and the entanglement entropy of accelerating defects; defects on the torus and Cardy formulas for the asymptotic density of states of the defect Hilbert space; and quenches produced by spacelike defects. The simplicity of the model allows for explicit computation of all these quantities, and provides a starting point for more complicated theories involving interactions.</description>

The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Towards construction of superintegrable basis in matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. Our consideration is based on a tight connection of superintegrable property of Gaussian Hermitian model and $W_{1 + \infty}$ algebra in Fock representation. Motivated by this example, we propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegrable polynomials. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superintegrable polynomials. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model.</description>

      <title>Comments on Compton forward scattering singularity in the NCQED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Autonomous systems and attractor behaviors in non-metricity gravity: stability analysis and cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics are rigorously investigated through the systematic application of autonomous system analysis to the gravitational field equations in non-metricity gravity. The systematic procedure to analyze the late-time cosmic acceleration in higher-order non-metricity gravity is demonstrated by exploring non-hyperbolic critical points with the center manifold theory. The stability properties of these critical points are also evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits. It is explicitly shown that the stable node can be realized. The critical points of each model are individually analyzed, and their corresponding cosmological implications are derived. The stability properties of these critical points are evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits, revealing that each model includes at least one stable node. Furthermore, the evolution plots of the cosmological parameters confirm the models capacity to exhibit accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of fields in $SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity ($SU(\infty)$-QGR)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum system. $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe, in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space. Fragmentation of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to parameters of their {\it internal} finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters and the perceived classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum states of subsystems and their relative evolution. At lowest order the effective Lagrangian of $SU(\infty)$-QGR~has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly some of the fundamental aspects of $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify the impact of the degeneracies of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$ algebra on the construction of the model; describe mixed states of subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called {\it internal space} of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space for physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$.</description>

      <title>On supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent papers, Fuentealba, Henneaux, and Troessaert (FHT) gave definitions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism and showed that their definitions match with the Chen, Wang, Yau (CWY) definitions of Lorentz charges at null infinity which are free from ``supertranslation ambiguities''. In this brief note, motivated by the analysis of FHT, we write expressions for the supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in Beig-Schmidt variables at spacelike and timelike infinity. We present calculations, building upon the work of Comp\`ere, Gralla, and Wei (CGW), to show that our expressions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges match the CWY definitions at null infinity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of electroweak scale from the conformal sector: A strongly coupled Higgs via the Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak (EW) scale via non-perturbative dynamics of a conformally invariant scalar sector at the classical level. We provide a method to estimate the non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of the background equations of motion in a scalar theory via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Higgs mass in the strongly coupled regime in terms of its quartic self interaction term and the cut-off scale of the theory. We also show that the Higgs sector is an essential part of the Standard Model as, without it, a Yang--Mills gauge theory cannot acquire mass even if a self-interaction term is present. Our analysis lead to a more realistic model building with possible solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and, in general, to the dynamical generation of any scales scales in nature, be it the visible sector or the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the stress within a strongly coupled scalar nucleon, and now dissect the gravitational form factors into contributions from its constituents, the (mock) nucleon and the (mock) pion. The computation is based on a non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa model in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism with a Fock sector expansion including up to one nucleon and two pions. By employing the ``good currents" $T^{++}_i$, $T^{+-}_i$ and $T^{12}_i$, we extract the full set of gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$, $\bar c_i$ without the contamination of the spurious form factors, and free of uncanceled UV divergences. With these results, we decompose the mass of the system into its constituents and compute the matter and mechanical radii, gaining insights into the strongly coupled system.</description>

In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology.

      <title>Absorption, Scattering, Geodesics, Shadows and Lensing Phenomena of Black Holes in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the signatures of black holes within an effective quantum gravity framework recently proposed in the literature [1] . We begin by outlining the general setup, highlighting the two distinct models under consideration. This includes a discussion of their general properties, interpretations, and the structure of the event and inner horizons. We then examine the behavior of light in this context, analyzing geodesics, the photon sphere, and shadow formation. To validate our results, we estimate lower bounds for the shadow radius based on observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we derive the partial radial wave equation for scalar perturbations, enabling us to study the absorption cross section in both low and high frequency regimes. Additionally, we evaluate the greybody factors and provide bounds for both bosonic and fermionic fields. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of gravitational lensing in both the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection regime, the Gauss Bonnet theorem is employed, while for the strong deflection limit, the Tsukamoto approach is utilized.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks viewpoint for solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are employed to solve the Dyson--Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space, with a focus on the non-perturbative generation of the fermion's dynamical mass function in the Landau gauge. By inserting the integral equation directly into the loss function, our PINN framework enables a single neural network to learn a continuous and differentiable representation of the mass function over a spectrum of momenta. Also, we benchmark our approach against a traditional numerical algorithm showing the main differences among them. Our novel strategy, which can be extended to other quantum field theories, paves the way for forefront applications of machine learning in high-level theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity from Weyl connection and the $f(R,\cal{A})$ extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Weyl connection and Weyl geometry in order to construct novel modified gravitational theories. In the simplest case where one uses only the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general relativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a general potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to new modified gravity theories, where the extra degrees of freedom arise from the Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs from the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl field, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are of second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally, we construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\tilde{R},\cal{A})$ gravity, which is also ghost free. Applying the above classes of theories at a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical origin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective cosmological constant, and thus we recover $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless in more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy. These theories can reproduce the thermal history of the Universe, and the corresponding dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior.</description>

      <title>The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in the hyperboloidal framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor types are thoroughly investigated and put into several typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega&lt;0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes are studied in frequency-domain and time-domain, respectively. For the frequency-domain, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time-domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time-domain regardless of the shapes of the original effective potentials. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. Besides, we also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.</description>

Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

      <title>BV description of $N = 1$, $D = 4$ Supergravity in the first order formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note examines the BV formulation of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in the first-order Palatini--Cartan framework. Challenges in achieving an off-shell formulation are addressed by introducing corrections to the rank 2 BV action, offering in addition a solid foundation for the study of the theory on manifolds with boundary.</description>
