      <title>Rates of convergence for multivariate SDEs driven by L\'evy processes in the small-time stable domain of attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the rates of convergence of solutions for multivariate stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by L\'evy processes within the small-time stable domain of attraction (DoA). Explicit bounds are derived for the uniform Wasserstein distance between solutions of two L\'evy-driven SDEs, expressed in terms of driver characteristics. These bounds establish convergence rates in probability for drivers in the DoA, and yield uniform Wasserstein distance convergence for SDEs with additive noise. The methodology uses two couplings for L\'evy driver jump components, leading to sharp convergence rates tied to the processes' intrinsic properties.</description>

      <title>Skellam Processes via Multiparameter Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mltiparameter version of Skellam point process via multiparameter Poisson processes. Its distributional properties are studied in detail. Its compound representation is derived for a particular case. Also, its Riemann integral over a rectangle in $\mathbb{R}^M_+$, $M\ge1$ is introduced and a closed expression for its characteristic function is obtained. Later, we introduce a different version of multiparameter Skellam process, and derive a weak convergence result for it. Moreover, a two parameter fractional Skellam process is discussed.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-solutions to stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with superlinear drifts driven by space-time white noise^</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with logarithmic superlinear coefficient b, driven by space-time white noise W: $$ u_t(t,x) = (1/2)u_{xx}(t,x) + b(u(t,x)) + \sigma(u(t,x))W(dt,dx) $$ for $t &gt; 0$ and $x \in [0,1]$, with initial condition $$ u(0,x) = u_0(x) $$ for $x \in [0,1]$, where $u_0 \in L^2[0,1]$.
  In this paper, we establish existence and uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions in $C(R_+, L^2[0,1])$. Our result resolves a problem from [Ann. Probab. 47 (2019) 519-559] and provides an alternative proof of the non-blowup of $L^2[0,1]$ solutions from the same reference. We use new Gronwall-type inequalities. Due to nonlinearity, we work with first order moments, requiring precise estimates of the stochastic convolution.</description>

      <title>A geometric model of synthetic filtrations via context-dependent time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical filtrations in probability theory formalize the accumulation of information along a linear time axis: the past is unique and the present evolves into an uncertain future. In many contexts, however, information is neither linear nor uniquely determined by a single history. In this paper we propose a geometric model of synthetic filtrations, where the present may be formed by synthesizing multiple possible pasts. To achieve this, we introduce a new category {\Sigma}, an extension of the simplex category {\Delta}, whose objects encode context-dependent times. Synthetic filtrations are realized as contravariant functors {\Sigma} {\to} Prob, where Prob is the category of probability spaces with null-preserving maps. After seeing a general definition of synthetic filtrations, we define, as a concrete example, Dirichlet filtrations, where probability measures on simplices arise from Dirichlet distributions, highlighting the role of parameter and contextual uncertainty. Finally, we interpret Bayesian updating as a categorical update of a Dirichlet functor, showing how learning fits naturally into the synthetic filtration framework. This work combines categorical probability, simplicial geometry, and Bayesian statistics, and suggests new applications in finance, stochastic modeling, and subjective probability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates for Ergodic SDEs Driven by Multiplicative $\alpha$-Stable Processes in Wasserstein-1 distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the quantitative stability of invariant measures $\mu_{\alpha}$ for $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued ergodic stochastic differential equations driven by rotationally invariant multiplicative $\alpha$-stable processes with $\alpha\in(1,2]$. Under structural assumptions on the coefficients with a fixed parameter vector $\bm{\theta}$, we derive optimal convergence rates in the Wasserstein-$1$ ($\cW_{1}$) distance between the invariant measures introduced above, namely,
  \item[(i)] For any interval $[\alpha_0, \vartheta_0] \subset (1,2)$, there exists $C_1 = C(\alpha_0, \vartheta_0,\bm{\theta},d) &gt; 0$ such that
  \cW_{1}(\mu_\alpha, \mu_\vartheta) \leq C_1 |\alpha - \vartheta|, \quad \forall \alpha, \vartheta \in [\alpha_0, \vartheta_0].

  \item[(ii)] For any $\alpha_0\in (1,2)$, there exists $C_2 = C(\alpha_0, \bm{\theta}) &gt; 0$ such that \begin{align*}
  \cW_{1}(\mu_\alpha, \mu_2) \leq C_2\, d(2 - \alpha), \quad \forall \alpha \in [\alpha_0, 2).
The optimality of these rates is rigorously verified by explicit calculations for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck systems in \cite{Deng2023Optimal}. It is worth emphasizing that \cite{Deng2023Optimal} addressed only case (ii) under additive noise, whereas our analysis establishes results for both cases (i) and (ii) under multiplicative $\alpha$-stable noise, employing fundamentally different analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Strassen's theorem for biased convex order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strassen's theorem asserts that for given marginal probabilities $\mu,\nu$ there exists a martingale starting in $\mu$ and terminating in $\nu$ if and only if $\mu,\nu$ are in convex order. From a financial perspective, it guarantees the existence of market-consistent martingale pricing measures for arbitrage-free prices of European call options and thus plays a fundamental role in robust finance. Arbitrage-free prices of American options demand a stronger version of martingales which are 'biased' in a specific sense. In this paper, we derive an extension of Strassen's theorem that links them to an appropriate strengthening of the convex order. Moreover, we provide a characterization of this order through integrals with respect to compensated Poisson processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider local singular perturbations of a one-dimensional Laplace operator from the point of view of semigroup theory. Under certain assumptions, we prove the convergence of the corresponding semigroups to the heat semigroup with Robin-type boundary conditions at zero. As an application we provide semigroup theoretical approach to calculating the distribution of the local time for Brownian motion when it exits an interval.</description>

      <title>Parities in random Latin squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Latin square, every row can be interpreted as a permutation, and therefore has a parity (even or odd). We prove that in a uniformly random $n\times n$ Latin square, the $n$ row parities are very well approximated by a sequence of $n$ independent unbiased coin flips: for example, the total variation error of this approximation tends to zero as $n\to\infty$. This resolves a conjecture of Cameron. In fact, we prove a generalisation of Cameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column parities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between rows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).
  Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of random Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable intercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin squares with a certain independent model.</description>

      <title>The Gamma Expansion of the Level Two Large Deviation Rate Functional for Reversible Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \begin{equation*} d\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\bm{w}_{t}\,, \end{equation*} where $(\bm{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon&gt;0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\bb R^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mc I_\epsilon$ as $\mc I_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mc J^{(-1)} + \mc J^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mf q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mc J^{(p)}$, where $\mc J^{(p)}\colon \mc P(\bb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; \mf q$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mc J^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of random perturbations of non-normal Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral properties of Toeplitz operators and their finite truncations have long been central in operator theory. In the finite dimensional, non-normal setting, the spectrum is notoriously unstable under perturbations. Random perturbations provide a natural framework for studying this instability and identifying spectral features that emerge in typical noisy situations. This article surveys recent advances on the spectral behavior of (polynomially vanishing) random perturbations of Toeplitz matrices, focusing mostly on the limiting spectral distribution, the distribution of outliers, and localization of eigenvectors, and highlight the major techniques used to study these problems. We complement the survey with new results on the limiting spectral distribution of polynomially vanishing random perturbation of Toeplitz matrices with continuous symbols, on the limiting spectral distribution of finitely banded Toeplitz matrices under exponentially and super-exponentially vanishing random perturbations, and on the complete localization of outlier eigenvectors of randomly perturbed Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>Ancona inequalities along generic geodesic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents several versions of the Ancona inequality for finitely supported, irreducible random walks on non-amenable groups. We first study a class of Morse subsets with narrow points and prove the Ancona inequality around these points in any finitely generated non-amenable group. This result implies the inequality along all Morse geodesics and recovers the known case for relatively hyperbolic groups.
  We then consider any geometric action of a non-amenable group with contracting elements. For such groups, we construct a class of generic geodesic rays, termed proportionally contracting rays, and establish the Ancona inequality along a sequence of good points. This leads to an embedding of a full-measure subset of the horofunction boundary into the minimal Martin boundary.
  A stronger Ancona inequality is established for groups acting geometrically on an irreducible CAT(0) cube complex with a Morse hyperplane. In this setting, we show that the orbital maps extend continuously to a partial boundary map from a full-measure subset of the Roller boundary into the minimal Martin boundary. Finally, we provide explicit examples, including right-angled Coxeter groups (RACGs) defined by an irreducible graph with at least one vertex not belonging to any induced 4-cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, the author discusses the derivation of unit distributions and the derivation of the generalized form using the order statistics. The author discusses the Kumaraswamy as the smallest order statistic of the unit power distribution derived from the inverse Weibull distribution. The author discusses the unit Rayleigh distribution and how it can be generalized using the smallest, largest, and kth order statistics. Using the order statistics to generalize a distribution differs from other techniques like the power transformation and T-X family (transformed-transformer) method. For the discussed distribution, the author demonstrates the basic functions and properties with real data analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new property of value at risk (VaR), which is a standard risk measure that is widely used in quantitative financial risk management. We show that the subadditivity of VaR for given loss random variables holds for any confidence level if and only if those are comonotonic. This result also gives a new equivalent condition for the comonotonicity of random vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gillespie algorithm and its extensions are commonly used for the simulation of chemical reaction networks. A limitation of these algorithms is that they have to process and update the system after every reaction, requiring significant computation. Another class of algorithms, based on the tau-leaping method, is able to simulate multiple reactions at a time at the cost of decreased accuracy. We present a new algorithm for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks that is capable of sampling multiple reactions at a time via a first-order approximation similarly to the tau-leaping methods. We prove that the algorithm has an improved runtime complexity compared to existing methods for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks, and present an efficient and easy to use implementation that outperforms existing methods in practice.</description>

      <title>Myopic Optimality: why reinforcement learning portfolio management strategies lose money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myopic optimization (MO) outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) in portfolio management: RL yields lower or negative returns, higher variance, larger costs, heavier CVaR, lower profitability, and greater model risk. We model execution/liquidation frictions with mark-to-market accounting. Using Malliavin calculus (Clark-Ocone/BEL), we derive policy gradients and risk shadow price, unifying HJB and KKT. This gives dual gap and convergence results: geometric MO vs. RL floors. We quantify phantom profit in RL via Malliavin policy-gradient contamination analysis and define a control-affects-dynamics (CAD) premium of RL indicating plausibly positive.</description>

      <title>Least squares estimation of the transition density in bifurcating Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a least squares method for the estimation of the transition density in bifurcating Markov models. Unlike the kernel estimation, this method do not use the quotient which can be a source of errors. In order to study the rate of convergence for least squares estimators, we develop exponential inequalities for empirical process of bifurcating Markov chain under bracketing assumption. Unlike the classical processes, we observe that for bifurcating Markov chains, the complexity parameter depends on the ergodicity rate and as consequence, we have that the convergence rate of our estimator is a function of the ergodicity rate. We conclude with a numerical study to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Elementary differentials from multi-indices to rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove comparison theorems for the horizontal Laplacian of the Riemannian distance in the context of Riemannian foliations with minimal leaves. This general framework generalizes previous works and allow us to consider the sub-Laplacian of Carnot groups of arbitrary steps. The comparison theorems yield a Bonnet-Myers type theorem, stochastic completeness and Lipschitz regularization property for the sub-Riemannian semigroup.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of quadratic RBSDEs and BSDEs with one-sided growth restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of bounded and unbounded solutions for reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The generators of these equations satisfy a one-sided growth restriction on the variable $y$ and have a general quadratic growth in the variable $z$. The solutions $Y_t$ (and the obstacles of RBSDEs) take values in either $\mathbf{R}$ or $(0, \infty)$. We obtain the existence of solutions primarily by using the methods from Essaky and Hassani (2011) and Bahlali et al. (2017). For the uniqueness of solutions, we provide a method applicable when the generators are convex in $(y,z)$ or are (locally) Lipschitz in $y$ and convex in $z$. Our method relies on the $\theta$-difference technique introduced by Briand and Hu (2008), and some innovative comparison arguments based on RBSDEs. We also establish some general comparison theorems for such RBSDEs and BSDEs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sets and Quantization Errors under Geometric Constraints for Discrete Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of constrained quantization for both finite and infinite discrete probability distributions supported on subsets of the real line. Under specific geometric constraints - namely, a semicircular arc and the union of two sides of an equilateral triangle - we compute constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the corresponding $n$th constrained quantization errors. For finite discrete distributions, we consider both uniform and nonuniform cases with support on $\{-3, -2, \dots, 3\}$. For infinite discrete distributions, two cases are analyzed: one supported on $\left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$ and the other on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$. Explicit constructions and numerical computations of optimal quantizers and errors are provided. Furthermore, for the infinite discrete distribution supported on $\mathbb{N}$, we develop a general framework for constrained quantization under the linear constraint $y = mx + c$ and prove that the constrained quantization dimension in this setting is zero. Our results highlight how geometric constraints influence the structure and existence of optimal quantizers and pave the way for further investigations into constrained quantization theory.</description>

We sketch but do not prove an equivalent conjecture to Feige's Conjecture $\mathbb{P} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} &lt; \mu + 1 \right) \geq \exp \left(-1 \right)$, where $\mu$ is the expected value of the sum of the random variables. We show by a simple example how this inequality finds use in mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuations of last passage percolation with thick boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the exponential last passage percolation (LPP) with thick two-sided boundary that consists of a few inhomogeneous columns and rows. Ben Arous and Corwin previously studied the limit fluctuations in this model except in a critical regime, for which they predicted that the limit distribution exists and depends only on the most dominant columns and rows. In this article, we prove their conjecture and identify the limit distribution explicitly in terms of a Fredholm determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix kernel. This result leads in particular to an explicit variational formula for the one-point marginal of the KPZ fixed point for a new class of initial conditions. Our limit distribution is also a novel generalization of and provides a new numerically efficient representation for the Baik--Rains distribution.</description>

      <title>Law of the iterated logarithm for supercritical non-local spatial branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $X=(X_{t})_{t\ge 0}$ is either a general supercritical non-local branching Markov process, or a general supercritical non-local superprocess, on a Luzin space. Here, by ``supercritical" we mean that the mean semigroup of $X$ exhibits a Perron-Frobenius type behaviour with a positive principal eigenvalue. In this paper, we study the almost sure behaviour of a family of martingales naturally associated with the real or complex-valued eigenpairs of the mean semigroup. Under a fourth-moment condition, we establish limit theorems of the iterated logarithm type for these martingales. In particular, we discover three regimes, each resulting in different scaling factors and limits. Furthermore, we obtain a law of the iterated logarithm for the linear functional $\langle \mathrm{Re}(f),X_{t}\rangle$ where $f$ is a sum of finite terms of eigenfunctions and $\mathrm{Re}(f)$ denotes its real part. In the context of branching Markov processes, our results improve on existing literature by complementing the known results for multitype branching processes in Asmussen [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 231 (1) (1977) 233--248] and generalizing the recent work of Hou, Ren and Song [arXiv: 2505.12691] to allow for non-local branching mechanism and non-symmetric spatial motion. For superprocesses, as far as we know, our results are new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal liquidation problems where the agent's transactions create transient price impact driven by a Volterra-type propagator along with temporary price impact. We formulate these problems as maximization of a revenue-risk functionals, where the agent also exploits available information on a progressively measurable price predicting signal. By using an infinite dimensional stochastic control approach, we characterize the value function in terms of a solution to a free-boundary $L^2$-valued backward stochastic differential equation and an operator-valued Riccati equation. We then derive analytic solutions to these equations which yields an explicit expression for the optimal trading strategy. We show that our formulas can be implemented in a straightforward and efficient way for a large class of price impact kernels with possible singularities such as the power-law kernel.</description>

      <title>Merging Rate of Opinions via Optimal Transport on Random Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random measures provide flexible parameters for Bayesian nonparametric models. Given two different priors for a random measure, we develop a natural framework to investigate the rate at which the corresponding posteriors merge, as the sample size increases. We define a new distance between the laws of random measures that is built as a Wasserstein distance on the ground space of unbalanced measures, endowed with the bounded Lipschitz metric. We develop tight analytical bounds for its specification to completely random measures, including the special case of Poisson and gamma random measures. The bounds are interpreted in terms of an adapted extended Wasserstein distance between the L\'evy measures and are used to investigate the merging between the posteriors of normalized gamma and generalized gamma priors. After a careful study on the identifiability of the law of the random measure, interesting asymptotic and finite-sample insights are derived without putting any assumption on the true data generating process.</description>

      <title>Conditional uncorrelation equals independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the stochastic independence of real-valued random variables is equivalent to the conditional uncorrelation, where the conditioning takes place over the Cartesian products of intervals. Next, we express the mutual independence in terms of the conditional correlation matrix. Our results extend the results of Jaworski et al. (Electron. J. Stat., 18(1), 653-673, 2024), which are based on the copula functions and assume the existence of the joint density of the variables. We relax this assumption and show that the independence characterization via conditional uncorrelation is valid in full generality - that is, for all kinds of random variables and any dependencies between them. Additionally, we analyse the assumptions under which the independence is determined by the local uncorrelation. The measure-theoretic methodology we present uses the Radon-Nikodym derivative to reduce the multidimensional characterization problem to the simple one-dimensional conditioning. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of the presented results, various numerical examples are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call \emph{permutation mixtures}) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. We obtain as a corollary a new de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987), as well as several new statistical results, including a differential privacy guarantee for the ``shuffled privacy model'' with Gaussian noise and improved generic consistency guarantees for empirical Bayes procedures in compound decision problems.</description>

      <title>Convex Regularization and Convergence of Policy Gradient Flows under Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints, crucial for applications like autonomous systems, finance, and resource management. We propose a doubly-regularized RL framework combining reward and parameter regularization to address safety constraints in continuous state-action spaces. The problem is formulated as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Leveraging mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows, policies are modeled on an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with updates governed by parameter distribution gradient flows. Key contributions include solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, smooth bounded approximations for gradient flows, and exponential convergence guarantees under sufficient regularization. General regularization conditions, including entropy regularization, support practical particle method implementations. This framework provides robust theoretical insights and guarantees for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the Splits through Minimax Decision Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By revisiting the end-cut preference (ECP) phenomenon associated with a single CART (Breiman et al. (1984)), we introduce MinimaxSplit decision trees, a robust alternative to CART that selects splits by minimizing the worst-case child risk rather than the average risk. For regression, we minimize the maximum within-child squared error; for classification, we minimize the maximum child entropy, yielding a C4.5-compatible criterion. We also study a cyclic variant that deterministically cycles coordinates, leading to our main method of cyclic MinimaxSplit decision trees. We prove oracle inequalities that cover both regression and classification, under mild marginal non-atomicity conditions. The bounds control the tree's global excess risk by local worst-case impurities and yield fast convergence rates compared to CART. We extend the analysis to ensembles that subsample coordinates per node. Empirically, (cyclic) MinimaxSplit trees and their forests improve on structured heterogeneity data such as EEG amplitude regression over fixed time horizons, seasonal air quality forecasting, and image denoising framed as non-parametric regression on spatial coordinates.</description>

Abstract: We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak factor of i.i.d. Then, a low-cost graphing of this process is constructed by connecting the points of each horoball first, and then adding a percolation with small intensity. The connectedness of this graphing is ensured by proving that the resulting horoballs have the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully.</description>
