      <title>Inference in dynamic models for panel data using the moving block bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference in linear panel data models is complicated by the presence of fixed effects when (some of) the regressors are not strictly exogenous. Under asymptotics where the number of cross-sectional observations and time periods grow at the same rate, the within-group estimator is consistent but its limit distribution features a bias term. In this paper we show that a panel version of the moving block bootstrap, where blocks of adjacent cross-sections are resampled with replacement, replicates the limit distribution of the within-group estimator. Confidence ellipsoids and hypothesis tests based on the reverse-percentile bootstrap are thus asymptotically valid without the need to take the presence of bias into account.</description>

      <title>Scenario analysis with multivariate Bayesian machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an econometric framework that adapts tools for scenario analysis, such as conditional forecasts and generalized impulse response functions, for use with dynamic nonparametric multivariate models. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through an exercise with simulated data, and three real-world applications: (i) scenario-based conditional forecasts aligned with Federal Reserve Bank stress test assumptions, (ii) measuring macroeconomic risk under varying financial conditions, and (iii) the asymmetric effects of US-based financial shocks and their international spillovers. Our results indicate the importance of nonlinearities and asymmetries in the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic and financial variables.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences and Changes-in-Changes with Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample selection arises endogenously in causal research when the treatment affects whether certain units are observed. It is a common pitfall in longitudinal studies, particularly in settings where treatment assignment is confounded. In this paper, I highlight the drawbacks of one of the most popular identification strategies in such settings: Difference-in-Differences (DiD). Specifically, I employ principal stratification analysis to show that the conventional ATT estimand may not be well defined, and the DiD estimand cannot be interpreted causally without additional assumptions. To address these issues, I develop an identification strategy to partially identify causal effects on the subset of units with well-defined and observed outcomes under both treatment regimes. I adapt Lee bounds to the Changes-in-Changes (CiC) setting (Athey &amp; Imbens, 2006), leveraging the time dimension of the data to relax the unconfoundedness assumption in the original trimming strategy of Lee (2009). This setting has the DiD identification strategy as a particular case, which I also implement in the paper. Additionally, I explore how to leverage multiple sources of sample selection to relax the monotonicity assumption in Lee (2009), which may be of independent interest. Alongside the identification strategy, I present estimators and inference results. I illustrate the relevance of the proposed methodology by analyzing a job training program in Colombia.</description>

      <title>Assessing Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effect heterogeneity is of major interest in economics, but its assessment is often hindered by the fundamental lack of identification of the individual treatment effects. For example, we may want to assess the effect of a poverty reduction measure at different levels of poverty, but the causal effects on wealth at different wealth levels are not identified. Or, we may be interested in the proportion of workers who benefit from the minimum wage increase, but the proportion is not identified in the absence of counterfactuals. This paper derives bounds useful in such situations, which only depend on the marginal distributions of the outcomes. The bounds are nonparametrically sharp, making clear the maximum extent to which the data can speak about the heterogeneity of the treatment effects. An application to microfinance shows that the bounds can be informative even when the average treatment effects are not significant. Another application to the welfare reform identifies a nonnegligible portion of workers who increased and decreased working hours due to the reform.</description>

      <title>Using Multiple Outcomes to Improve the Synthetic Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When there are multiple outcome series of interest, Synthetic Control analyses typically proceed by estimating separate weights for each outcome. In this paper, we instead propose estimating a common set of weights across outcomes, by balancing either a vector of all outcomes or an index or average of them. Under a low-rank factor model, we show that these approaches lead to lower bias bounds than separate weights, and that averaging leads to further gains when the number of outcomes grows. We illustrate this via a re-analysis of the impact of the Flint water crisis on educational outcomes.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation and Inference for High-Dimensional Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides the relevant literature with a complete toolkit for conducting robust estimation and inference about the parameters of interest involved in a high-dimensional panel data framework. Specifically, (1) we allow for non-Gaussian, serially and cross-sectionally correlated and heteroskedastic error processes, (2) we develop an estimation method for high-dimensional long-run covariance matrix using a thresholded estimator, (3) we also allow for the number of regressors to grow faster than the sample size.
  Methodologically and technically, we develop two Nagaev--types of concentration inequalities: one for a partial sum and the other for a quadratic form, subject to a set of easily verifiable conditions. Leveraging these two inequalities, we derive a non-asymptotic bound for the LASSO estimator, achieve asymptotic normality via the node-wise LASSO regression, and establish a sharp convergence rate for the thresholded heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator.
  We demonstrate the practical relevance of these theoretical results by investigating a high-dimensional panel data model with interactive effects. Moreover, we conduct extensive numerical studies using simulated and real data examples.</description>
