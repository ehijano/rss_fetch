      <title>Emission-Line Ratios and Ionization Conditions of CEERS Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy emission-line fluxes can be analyzed to determine star formation rates (SFR) and ISM ionization. Here, we investigate rest-frame optical emission lines of 71 star-forming galaxies at redshift 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 7 from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey using JWST/NIRSpec. We use H${\alpha}$ line fluxes to measure SFRs. We combine these with HST CANDELS stellar mass estimates to determine the redshift evolution of specific SFR (sSFR) and compare our sample with the star-forming galaxy main sequence. We create [O III]${\lambda}$5008/H${\beta}$ versus [Ne III]${\lambda}$3870/[O II]${\lambda}$3728 line ratio diagrams and correlate these ratios with sSFR and the distance of each galaxy from the main sequence (excess sSFR). We find a modest correlation between the line ratios and sSFR, which is consistent with previous work analyzing similar samples. However, we find a weak correlation between the line ratios and excess sSFR. Taken together, our results suggest that sSFR is the parameter that governs ionization conditions rather than SFR or a galaxy's distance from the main sequence. These measurements reveal a rich diversity of ISM conditions and physical galaxy properties throughout cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Connecting the growth of galaxies to the large-scale environment in a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z~3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct link between large-scale environment and galaxy properties is very well established in the local universe. However, very little is known about the role of the environment for galaxy growth before the peak of the cosmic star formation history at $z&gt;3$ due to the rarity of high-redshift, overdense structures. Using a combination of deep, multiwalength observations, including MUSE, JWST, Chandra, HST and ground-based imaging, we detect and study the properties of a population of star-forming galaxies in the field of a hyperluminous quasar at $z\approx3.25$ associated with the giant Ly$\alpha$ nebula MQN01. We find that this region hosts one of the largest overdensity of galaxies found so far at $z&gt;3$, with $\rho/\bar{\rho}=53\pm17$ within $4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2$ and $|\Delta v|&lt;1000\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$ from the quasar, providing a unique laboratory to study the link between overdense regions and galaxy properties at high redshift. Even in these rare overdense regions, galaxies are forming stars at a rate consistent with the main sequence at $z\approx3$, demonstrating that their SFR is regulated by local properties correlated with their stellar mass rather than by their environment. However, the high-mass-end of the stellar mass function is significantly elevated with respect to that of galaxies in the field at $\log(M_\star/{M_\odot})\gtrsim10.5$, suggesting that massive galaxies in overdense regions build-up their stellar mass earlier or more efficiently than in average regions of the universe. Finally, the overdensity of color-selected Lyman break galaxies observed on larger scales, across $\approx24\times24\rm\,cMpc^2$, is found to be aligned toward the structure traced by the spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies identified with MUSE in the inner $4\times4\rm\,cMpc^2$, suggesting that this highly overdense region could further extend up to a few tens of comoving Mpc.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Ecosystem in Galaxies (BEINGMgII) -- II. Unveiling the Nature of Galaxies Harboring Cool Gas Reservoirs</title>

Abstract: We search for the galaxies associated with the intervening MgII absorbers over a redshift range of $0.4 \le z \le 1.0$ using imaging data from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and measure the redshift based on direct detection of nebular emission in the background quasar spectra from SDSS survey. We find 270 MgII absorbers associated with strong [O II] nebular emissions, at $2.5\sigma$ level. Among them, for 213 MgII absorbers, we detect an absorber host galaxy at impact parameters of $4 \le \rho \le 16$ kpc, including a galaxy pair associated with three absorbers, with best-fit galaxy SED model based on multi-passband photometric data from DESI Legacy Imaging surveys, supplemented with the infrared VISTA and unWISE imaging surveys. The detection rate of MgII absorber host with strong [O II] nebular emission in the finite SDSS fiber of 2--3 arcsec diameter increases from 0.2% to $\sim$3% with increasing equivalent width from $0.3$\r{A} to $\sim$ 3.5\r{A}, which remains near-constant across the probed redshift range. The associated MgII host galaxies exhibit a wide range of stellar mass from 7.94 $\le \rm log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le $ 11.11, with an average star-formation rate (SFR) of $ 5.81 \rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$. The MgII absorber hosts selected based on [O II] nebular emission mostly exhibit active star-forming systems including 13.4% starburst systems, but 10.2% with suppressed SFR. The near-constant absorption strength at low-impact parameters suggests a high gas covering fraction. We find that the MgII equivalent width ($W_{2796}$) positively correlates with SFR and specific-SFR, likely indicate their wind origin. The average velocity offset between the host and absorber suggests that the MgII gas is bound within the dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>A Quasar-Anchored Protocluster at z=6.6 in the ASPIRE Survey: I. Properties of [OIII] Emitters in a 10 Mpc Overdensity Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using JWST to target a sample of 25 $z&gt;6$ quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at $z=6.61$, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin$^2$ with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H$\beta$ at $5.3&lt;z&lt;7$ and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2$\times$10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at $6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8$ spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc$^3$ volume of 12.5 $\pm$ 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s$^{-1}$) $&lt;$ 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales $&gt;10$ cMpc.</description>

      <title>A Quasar-Anchored Protocluster at z=6.6 in the ASPIRE Survey: II. An Environmental Analysis of Galaxy Properties in an Overdense Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present paper II comprising a 35 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mosaic centered on J0305$-$3150, a luminous quasar at $z=6.61$. The F356W grism data reveals 124 [OIII]+H$\beta$ emitters at $5.3&lt;z&lt;7$, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)$^2$ across $6.5&lt;z&lt;6.8$. We find no evidence of any broad-line AGN in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median H$\beta$ FWHM of 585 $\pm$ 152 km s$^{-1}$; however, the mass-excitation diagram and ``little red dot" color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [OIII] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes, and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlates with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations between local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10-to-100 Myr star formation rate ratios and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3$\sigma$ level, distributed in a filamentary structure which supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.</description>

      <title>Suppressed accretion onto massive black hole binaries surrounded by thin disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming occurs at high photon energies, corresponding to the effective truncation of the circumbinary disk. As a result, such system may be underluminous in UV bands and missing X-ray emission entirely, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of binary black holes in $N$-body simulations of star clusters with up to two million stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding binary black hole (BBH) dynamics in dense star clusters is key to interpreting the gravitational wave detections by LIGO and Virgo. Here, we perform $N$-body simulations of star clusters, focusing on BBH formation mechanisms, dynamical evolution and merging properties. We explore a wide parameter space of initial conditions, with cluster masses ranging from $10^{4}$ to $10^{6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, densities from $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-3}$, and up to $100\%$ of massive stars in binaries. We show that most BBH mergers originate from the primordial binary population rather than being dynamically assembled, and that the evolution towards merger for most of these binaries is not significantly altered by dynamical encounters. As a result, the overall number of BBH mergers from the $N$-body simulations is nearly identical to that obtained when the same stellar population is evolved in isolation. Contrary to theoretical expectations, nearly all dynamically formed BBH mergers occur when the binary is still bound to its host cluster, with $\simeq 90\%$ of all dynamical mergers occurring within the cluster core region. In about half of these mergers the binary is part of a stable black hole-triple system. In one model, stellar mergers lead to the formation of a $\simeq 200\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ black hole, which then grows to $\simeq 300\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ through black hole mergers. Our study highlights the importance of detailed $N$-body simulations in capturing the evolution of black hole populations in dense clusters and challenges conclusions based on semi-analytical and Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>The Resolved Behavior of Dust Mass, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Fraction, and Radiation Field in ~ 800 Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present resolved $3.6-250~\mu$m dust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for $\sim 800$ nearby galaxies. We measure the distribution of radiation field intensities heating the dust, the dust mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm d}$), and the fraction of dust in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; $q_{\rm PAH}$). We find that the average interstellar radiation field ($\overline{U}$) is correlated both with stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\star}$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), while more intense radiation fields are only correlated with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. We show that $q_{\rm PAH}$ is a steeply decreasing function of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, likely reflecting PAH destruction in H II regions. Galaxy integrated $q_{\rm PAH}$ is strongly, negatively correlated with specific star formation rate (sSFR) and offset from the star-forming ``main sequence'' ($\Delta$MS), suggesting that both metallicity and star formation intensity play a role in setting the global $q_{\rm PAH}$. We also find a nearly constant M$_{\rm d}$/M$_\star$ ratio for galaxies on the main sequence, with a lower ratio for more quiescent galaxies, likely due to their lower gas fractions. From these results, we construct prescriptions to estimate the radiation field distribution in both integrated and resolved galaxies. We test these prescriptions by comparing our predicted $\overline{U}$ to results of SED fitting for stacked "main sequence" galaxies at $0&lt;z&lt;4$ from B\'ethermin et al. (2015) and find sSFR is an accurate predictor of $\overline{U}$ even at these high redshifts. Finally, we describe the public delivery of matched-resolution WISE and Herschel maps along with the resolved dust SED fitting results through the InfraRed Science Archive (IRSA).</description>

      <title>Precipitation possible: turbulence-driven thermal instability with constrained entropy profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation of cold gas due to thermal instability in both galaxy clusters and the circumgalactic medium may regulate AGN feedback. We investigate thermal instability in idealized simulations of the circumgalactic medium with a parameter study of over 600 three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of stratified turbulence with cooling, each evolved for 10 Gyr. The entropy profiles are maintained in a steady state via an idealized `thermostat' process, consistent with galaxy cluster entropy profiles. In the presence of external turbulent driving, we find cold gas precipitates, with a strong dependence whether the turbulent driving mechanism is solenoidal, compressive, or purely vertical. In the purely-vertical turbulent driving regime, we find that significant cold gas may form when the cooling time to free-fall time $t_{\rm cool} / t_{\text{ff}} \lesssim 5$. Our simulations with a ratio of $t_{\rm cool} / t_{\text{ff}} \sim 10$ do not precipitate under any circumstances, perhaps because the thermostat mechanism we use maintains a significant non-zero entropy gradient.</description>

      <title>X-ray view of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z~3 I. An exceptional overdensity of rapidly accreting SMBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring SMBH population in protoclusters offers valuable insights into how environment affects SMBH growth. However, research on AGN within these areas is still limited by the small number of protoclusters known at high redshift and by the availability of associated deep X-ray observations. To understand how different environments affect AGN triggering and growth at high redshift, we investigated the X-ray AGN population in the field of the MUSE Quasar Nebula 01 (MQN01) protocluster at z ~3.25. This field is known for hosting the largest Lya nebula in the Borisova+16 sample, and one of the largest overdensities of UV-continuum selected and sub-mm galaxies found so far at this redshift. We conducted a ultra deep Chandra X-ray survey (634 ks) observation of the MQN01 field and produced a comparative analyses of the properties of the X-ray AGNs detected in MQN01 against those observed in other selected protoclusters, such as Spiderweb and SSA22. By combining the X-ray, deep MUSE and ALMA data of the same field, we identified six X-ray AGNs within a volume of 16 cMpc^2 and \pm 1000 km/s, corresponding to an X-ray AGN overdensity of ~1000. This overdensity increases at the bright end, exceeding what was observed in the Spiderweb and SSA22 within similar volumes. The AGN fraction measured in MQN01 is significantly higher (f_AGN &gt; 20%) than in the field and increases with stellar masses, reaching a value of 100% for log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10.5. Lastly, we observe that the average specific accretion rate (\lambda_sBHAR) for SMBH populations in MQN01 is higher than in the field and other protoclusters, generally increasing as one moves toward the center of the overdensity. Our results, especially the large fraction of highly accreting SMBHs in the inner regions of the MQN01 overdensity, suggest that protocluster environments offer ideal physical conditions for SMBH triggering and growth.</description>

      <title>Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular cloudS (GEMS). X. Observational effects of turbulence on the chemistry of molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) We explore the chemistry of the most abundant C, O, S, and N bearing species in molecular clouds, in the context of the IRAM 30 m Large Programme Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular Clouds (GEMS). In this work, we aim to assess the limitations introduced in the observational works when a uniform density is assumed along the line of sight for fitting the observations, developing a very simple numerical model of a turbulent box. We perform a MHD simulation in order to reproduce the turbulent steady-state of a turbulent box with properties typical of a molecular filament before collapse. We post-process the results of the MHD simulation with a chemical code to predict molecular abundances, and then post-process this cube with a radiative transfer code to create synthetic emission maps for a series of rotational transitions observed during the GEMS project. From the chemical point of view, we find that turbulence produces variations on the predicted abundances, but they are more or less critical depending on the chosen transition and the chemical age. When compared to real observations, the results from the turbulent simulation provides a better fit than when assuming a uniform gas distribution along the line of sight. In the view of our results, we conclude that taking into account turbulence when fitting observations might significantly improve the agreement with model predictions. This is especially important for sulfur bearing species that are very sensitive to the variations of density produced by turbulence at early times (0.1 Myr). The abundance of CO is also quite sensitive to turbulence when considering the evolution beyond a few 0.1 Myr.</description>

      <title>Star formation in cosmic-dawn galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first two years of operation JWST has delivered key new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. By combining imaging with spectroscopy, we discovered and characterised the first generation of galaxies, probing the Universe at an age of 300 million years. While the current JWST observations confirm the overall cosmological framework and the paradigm of galaxy formation, there are also surprises, including large abundances of bright galaxies and accreting black holes in the early Universe. These observations, together with detailed measurements of the stellar populations and morphological structure, will help us to develop in the coming years a more refined understanding of the baryonic physics (including star formation and feedback processes) that leads to the formation of mature systems at later epochs, including our own Milky Way galaxy.</description>

      <title>An advanced approach for definition of the "Milky Way galaxies-analogues"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Galaxy - the Milky Way - has certain features of the structure and evolution. The morphological, photometric, kinematic, and chemodynamical properties are usually considered in the search for the Milky Way galaxies-analogues (MWAs). The discovery of MWA galaxies with a larger number of simultaneous selection parameters and more stringent constraints on a given parameter yields a sample of MWA galaxies with properties closer to the true properties of the Milky Way. So, in general, such MW parameters as the morphological type, luminosity, color indices, structural parameters (size, bar, bulge, thin and thick disks, inner ring, halo), bulge to total ratio, stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and rotation velocity were used in various combinations for comparison with other galaxies. However, the offset of some MW features in the multiparameter space of MWAs features should be significant. The paper aims to give a brief overview of the problematics and to present our approach for studying Milky Way and MWAs matching characteristics (this project is supported by the National Research Fund of Ukraine). We propose to enlarge as much as possible the number of Milky Way features and compile various samples of MWAs in our comoving cosmological volume for their further optimization. Such features can include 3Dkinematics of star's movement in certain regions, low oxygen content on the periphery, low nuclear activity, and the lack of significant merging over the past 10 Gyrs (isolation criterion). This approach will make it possible to widely formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the detection of MWA galaxies as well as to reveal other MW multiwavelength features.</description>

      <title>Growth of Massive Molecular Cloud Filament by Accretion Flows. II. New Mechanism to Support a Supercritical Filament against Radial Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that dense molecular filamentary clouds are sites of star formation. The filament width determines the fragmentation scale and influences the stellar mass. Therefore, understanding the evolution of filaments and the origin of their properties is important for understanding star formation. Although observations show a universal width of 0.1 pc, theoretical studies predict the contraction of thermally supercritical filaments (&gt; 17 Msun pc-1) due to radial collapse. Through non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we explore the formation and evolution of filaments via slow-shock instability at the front of accretion flows. We reveal that ambipolar diffusion allows the gas in the filament to flow across the magnetic fields around the shock, forming dense blobs behind the concave points of the shock. The blobs transfer momentum that drives internal turbulence. We name this mechanism the "STORM" (Slow-shock-mediated Turbulent flOw Reinforced by Magnetic diffusion). The persistence and efficiency of the turbulence inside the filament are driven by the magnetic field and the ambipolar diffusion effect, respectively. The STORM sustains the width even when the filament reaches very large line masses (~ 100 Msun pc-1).</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Radio Sources in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates.We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments.To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). We find the 'lower power-larger bubble' effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>SOFIA/EXES observations of warm H2 at high spectral resolution: II. IC443C, NGC2071, and 3C391</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the EXES instrument on SOFIA, we have obtained velocity-resolved spectra of several pure rotational lines of H2 toward shocked molecular gas within three Galactic sources: the supernova remnant (SNR) IC443 (Clump C), a protostellar outflow in the intermediate-mass star-forming region NGC 2071, and the SNR 3C391. These observations had the goal of searching for expected velocity shifts between ortho- and para-H2 transitions emitted by C-type shocks. In contrast in our previous similar study of HH7, the result of our search was negative: no velocity shifts were reliably detected. Several possible explanations for the absence of such shifts are discussed: these include a preshock ortho-to-para ratio that is already close to the high-temperature equilibrium value of 3 (in the case of IC443C), the more complex shock structures evident in all these sources, and the larger projected aperture sizes relative to those in the observations of HH7.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ISM Content of Nearby, Luminous, Type 1 and Type 2 QSOs through CO and [C II]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of CO(1--0) and CO(2--1) lines from the Institut de radioastronomie millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30m telescope toward 20 nearby, optically luminous type 2 quasars (QSO2s) and observations of [C II] 158$\mu$m line from the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) for 5 QSO2s in the CO sample and 5 type 1 quasars (QSO1s). In the traditional evolutionary scenario explaining different types of QSOs, obscured QSO2s emerge from gas-rich mergers observed as luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and then turn into unobscured QSO1s as the black holes clear out the obscuring material in a blow-out phase. We test the validity of this theoretical prediction by comparing the gas fractions and star formation efficiencies among LIRGs and QSOs. We find that CO luminosity, CO-derived gas masses and gas fractions in QSO1s are consistent with those estimated for QSO2s, while LIRGs exhibit a closer resemblance to QSO2s in terms of CO-derived gas masses and gas fractions, and [C II] luminosity. However, comparisons between [C II] luminosity and star formation tracers such as the CO and infrared luminosity imply additional sources of [C II] emission in QSO1s likely tracing neutral atomic or ionized gas. All three types of galaxies have statistically indistinguishable distributions of star formation efficiency. Our results are consistent with part of the evolutionary scenario where nearby QSO2s could emerge from LIRGs, but they are unlikely to be the precursors of nearby QSO1s.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Dynamo and Magnetic Fields in the Multiphase Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies has been known to have a multiphase structure (broadly hot, warm, and cold phases) since the 1970s, how magnetic fields differ between the ISM phases is still unknown. Using results from numerical simulations, this work explores how the multiphase nature of the ISM shapes magnetic fields and then discusses possible implications of those results for polarisation observations of the Milky Way and high-redshift galaxies. These findings will enhance our understanding of the role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution and prepare us to harness the upcoming wealth of radio polarisation data from the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders.</description>

      <title>VolDen: a tool to extract number density from the column density of filamentary molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas volume density is one of the critical parameters, along with dispersions in magnetic field position angles and non-thermal gas motions, for estimating the magnetic field strength using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) relation or through its modified versions for a given region of interest. We present VolDen an novel python-based algorithm to extract the number density map from the column density map for an elongated interstellar filament. VolDen uses the workflow of RadFil to prepare the radial profiles across the spine. The user has to input the column density map and pre-computed spine along with the essential RadFil parameters (such as distance to the filament, the distance between two consecutive radial profile cuts, etc.) to extract the radial column density profiles. The thickness and volume density values are then calculated by modeling the column density profiles with a Plummer-like profile and introducing a cloud boundary condition. The cloud boundary condition was verified through an accompanying N-PDF column density analysis. In this paper, we discuss the workflow of VolDen and apply it to two filamentary clouds. We chose LDN 1495 as our primary target owing to its nearby distance and elongated morphology. In addition, the distant filament RCW 57A is chosen as the secondary target to compare our results with the published results. Upon publication, a complete tutorial of VolDen and the codes will be available via GitHub.</description>

      <title>Nebular Dust Attenuation with the Balmer and Paschen Lines based on the MaNGA Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust attenuations observed by stars and ionized gas are not necessarily the same. The lack of observational constraints on the nebular dust attenuation curve leaves a large uncertainty when correcting nebular dust attenuation with stellar continuum-based attenuation curves. Making use of the DAP catalogs of the MaNGA survey, we investigate the nebular dust attenuation of HII regions traced by the Balmer and Paschen lines. Based on a simple simulation, we find that star-forming regions on kpc scales favor the classic foreground screen dust model rather than the uniform mixture model. We propose a novel approach to fit the dust attenuation curve using the emission-line fluxes directly. For strong hydrogen recombination lines (e.g., H$\gamma$, H$\delta$, and H$\epsilon$), the slopes of the nebular attenuation curve can be well determined and are found to be in good agreement with the Fitzpatrick Milky Way extinction curve with an accuracy of $\lesssim 4\%$ in terms of the correction factor. However, severe contaminations/systematic uncertainties prevent us from obtaining reasonable values of the slopes for weak recombination lines (e.g., the high-order Balmer lines or the Paschen lines). We discuss how the choice of emission line measurement methods affects the results. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of deriving an average nebular dust attenuation curve given the current ground-based emission-line measurements.</description>

      <title>The Observed O VI is Just the Tip of the Iceberg: Estimating the Hidden Material in Circumgalactic and Intergalactic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for estimating the total quantity of material in moving circumgalactic and intergalactic clouds from O VI measurements. We simulate high-velocity clouds (HVCs) with the FLASH hydrodynamic code and track the ionization and recombination of all ionization levels of oxygen as a function of time. We calculate the O VI/oxygen ratio ($f_{\rm O VI}$) in our dynamic NEI clouds, finding that it differs significantly from that in static gas. We find that O VI exists in cool, medium, and hot gas in the clouds. As such, it traces all of the hydrogen rather than merely the ionized hydrogen. The total quantity of hydrogen along a typical observed line of sight through a cloud can be estimated from the observed O VI column density, metallicity, and our $f_{\rm O VI}$. We provide the simulations' $f_{\rm O VI}$, a prescription for finding $f_{\rm O VI}$ for observed dynamic clouds, and a methodology for calculating the total hydrogen column density from this $f_{\rm O VI}$ and an observed O VI column density. As examples, we use our $f_{\rm O VI}$ to estimate the total hydrogen column densities along various observed sight lines through two HVCs, Complex C and the Magellanic Stream, finding that these clouds contain more material than the previous lower limits. We also extend this analysis to {low-redshift} intergalactic O VI clouds, finding that they contain several times more baryonic material than previously thought and therefore may account for a significant fraction of the Universe's baryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a sample of 114 Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram - star formation (BPT-SF) and Wide-field infrared Survey Exploer - low star formation rate (WISE-LSFR) early-type galaxies (ETGs) by utilizing the criterion W2-W3$&lt;2.5$ (where W2 and W3 are the wavelengths of 4.6 and 12 $\mu m$ in the WISE four bands) and cross-matching the $Galaxy~Zoo~1$ and the catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data SDSS Release 7 MPA-JHU emission-line measurements. We find that \textbf{$\sim 28\%$} of our ETGs exhibit a metallicity that is at least 2 standard deviation (0.26 dex) below the mass-metallicity (MZ) relation of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the SDSS. We demonstrate that almost all of our ETGs locate below the ``main sequence'' of SFGs. We find that these ETGs with larger metallicity deviation from the MZ relation tend to have lower SFR and redder color. By exploring the dilution properties of these massive ETGs, we report that the dilution effect may be mainly attributed to the inflow of metal-poor gas from mergers/interaction or the intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning generated observations of galaxy clusters from dark-matter-only simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations play a fundamental role in modern cosmological research, serving as a crucial bridge between theoretical predictions and observational data. However, due to their computational intensity, these simulations are currently constrained to relatively small volumes. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of utilising dark matter-only simulations to generate observable maps of galaxy clusters using a deep learning approach based on the U-Net architecture. We focus on reconstructing Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps (X-ray maps) from total mass density maps. We leverage data from \textsc{The Three Hundred} simulations, selecting galaxy clusters ranging in mass from $10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, the predictions show excellent agreement with the ground-truth datasets, with percentage errors averaging (0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% for the parameters of the scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Comparison of HMG and flat rotation velocities inferred from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of dark-matter models, unresolved issues require exploring alternatives such as modified gravity theories. In this context, we examine the compatibility of the Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) with galaxy rotation curves inferred from weak-lensing data. The research addresses the existing limitations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which often struggle with universal applicability across different galactic scales. By assuming local validity of General Relativity (GR) and analyzing recent data on circular velocities from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, our findings interpret the galactic dynamics anomaly as a fictitious acceleration inherited from the cosmic expansion, without invoking dark matter. The results indicate that HMG successfully reproduces flat velocity curves on scales of 1 Mpc slightly better than MOND. Therefore, these observations support HMG as a viable gravitational model, highlighting its potential to account for dynamics on galaxies and other scales. Further research with extensive datasets is required to confirm these preliminary insights.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LX. Molecular line list for the ammonia isotopologue $^{15}$NH$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04295</link>

Abstract: A theoretical line list for $^{15}$NH$_3$ CoYuTe-15 is presented based on the empirical potential energy and ab initio dipole moments surfaces developed and used for the production of the ExoMol line list CoYuTe for $^{14}$NH$_3$. The ro-vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions are computed using the variational program TROVE. The line list ranges up to 10000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda \geq 1$~$\mu$m) and contains 929 795 249 transitions between 1 269 961 states with $J\le 30$. The line list should be applicable for temperatures up to $\sim$1000 K. To improve the accuracy of the line positions, a set of experimentally-derived energy levels of $^{15}$NH$_3$ is produced using the MARVEL procedure. To this end, 37 experimental sources of the line positions of $^{15}$NH$_3$ available in the literature are collected, combined and systematised to produce a self-consistent spectroscopic network of 21095 $^{15}$NH$_3$ transitions covering 40 vibrational bands ranging up to 6818 cm$^{-1}$ and resulting in 2777 energy term values. These MARVEL energies are then used to replace the theoretical values in the CoYuTe-15 line list and also complemented by pseudo-MARVEL energies obtained by an isotopologue extrapolation using the previously reported MARVEL energies of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ parent isotopologue of ammonia. A list of 53856 high resolution transitions between MARVEL states and theoretical intensities is provided in the HITRAN format. Comparison with the recent experimental spectra of $^{15}$NH$_3$ illustrate the potential of the line list for detections and as an efficient assistant in spectroscopic assignments. The line list is available from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the GW background of Galactic (sub)solar mass primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-component dark matter models, a fraction $f_\text{pbh}$ of the dark matter could be in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) with (sub)solar masses. Some would have formed binaries that presently trace the Milky Way halo of particle dark matter. We explore the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by such a hypothetical population of Galactic PBH binaries and assess its detectability by the LISA experiment. For this purpose, we model the formation and evolution of early-type PBH binaries accounting for GW hardening and binary disruption in the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the present-day Galactic population of PBH binaries is characterized by very high orbital eccentricities $|1-e|\ll 1$. For a PBH mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$, this yields a GW background that peaks in the millihertz frequency range where the LISA instrumental noise is minimum. While this signal remains below the LISA detection threshold for viable $f_\text{pbh}\lesssim 0.01$, future GW observatories such as DECIGO and BBO could detect it if $0.01\lesssim M_{\rm pbh} \lesssim 0.1 M_\odot$. Furthermore, we anticipate that, after 5 years of observations, LISA should be able to detect $\mathcal{O}(100)$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(1)$) loud Galactic PBH binaries of mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$ with a SNR $\geq 5$ if $f_{\rm pbh}=0.01$ (resp. $f_{\rm pbh}=0.001$). Nonlinear effects not considered here such as mass accretion and dynamical capture could alter these predictions.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LII: M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- Presumed Identical Twins Appear Fraternal in Variability, Rotation, H$\alpha$, and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the rotation and stellar activity of four fully convective M dwarf `twin' wide binaries. Components in each pair have (1) astrometry confirming they are common-proper-motion binaries, (2) Gaia $BP$, $RP$, and 2MASS $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ magnitudes matching within 0.10 mag, and (3) presumably the same age and composition. We report long-term photometry, rotation periods, multi-epoch H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, X-ray luminosities, time series radial velocities, and speckle observations for all components. Although it might be expected for the twin components to have matching magnetic attributes, this is not the case. Decade-long photometry of GJ 1183 AB indicates consistently higher spot activity on A than B, a trend matched by A appearing 58$\pm$9% stronger in $L_X$ and 26$\pm$9% stronger in H$\alpha$ on average -- this is despite similar rotation periods of A=0.86d and B=0.68d, thereby informing the range in activity for otherwise identical and similarly-rotating M dwarfs. The young $\beta$ Pic Moving Group member 2MA 0201+0117 AB displays a consistently more active B component that is 3.6$\pm$0.5 times stronger in $L_X$ and 52$\pm$19% stronger in H$\alpha$ on average, with distinct rotation at A=6.01d and B=3.30d. Finally, NLTT 44989 AB displays remarkable differences with implications for spindown evolution -- B has sustained H$\alpha$ emission while A shows absorption, and B is $\geq$39$\pm$4 times stronger in $L_X$, presumably stemming from the surprisingly different rotation periods of A=38d and B=6.55d. The last system, KX Com, has an unresolved radial velocity companion, and is therefore not a twin system.</description>

      <title>Dust Dynamics in AGN Winds: A New Mechanism For Multiwavelength AGN Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial dust obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been proposed as a potential explanation for some cases of AGN variability. The dust-gas mixture present in AGN tori is accelerated by radiation pressure, leading to the launching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be unstable to a generic class of fast-growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). In this work, we present the first numerical simulations of radiation-driven outflows that explicitly include dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds. We investigate the implications of RDIs on the torus morphology, AGN variability, and the ability of radiation to effectively launch a wind. We find that the RDIs rapidly develop, reaching saturation at times much shorter than the global timescales of the outflows, resulting in the formation of filamentary structure on box-size scales with strong dust clumping and super-Alfv\'enic velocity dispersions. The instabilities lead to fluctuations in dust opacity and gas column density of 10-20\% when integrated along mock observed lines-of-sight to the quasar accretion disk. These fluctuations occur over year to decade timescales and exhibit a red-noise power spectrum commonly observed for AGN. Additionally, we find that the radiation effectively couples with the dust-gas mixture, launching highly supersonic winds that entrain 70-90\% of the gas, with a factor of $\lesssim 3$ photon momentum loss relative to the predicted multiple-scattering momentum loading rate. Therefore, our findings suggest that RDIs play an important role in driving the clumpy nature of AGN tori and generating AGN variability consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the stellar ages of dynamically separated bulges and disks of CALIFA spiral galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a recently developed population-orbit superposition technique to simultaneously fit the stellar kinematic and age maps of 82 CALIFA spiral galaxies and obtain the ages of stars in different dynamical structures. We first evaluated the capabilities of this method on CALIFA-like mock data created from the Auriga simulations. The recovered mean ages of dynamically cold, warm, and hot components match the true values well, with an observational error of up to $20\%$ in the mock age maps. For CALIFA spiral galaxies, we find that the stellar ages of the cold, warm, and hot components all increase with the stellar mass of the galaxies, from $\overline{t_{\rm cold}}\sim2.2$ Gyr, $\overline{t_{\rm warm}}\sim2.3$ Gyr, and $\overline{t_{\rm hot}}\sim2.6$ Gyr for galaxies with stellar mass $M_*&lt;10^{10}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, to $\overline{t_{\rm cold}}\sim4.0$ Gyr, $\overline{t_{\rm warm}}\sim5.1$ Gyr, and $\overline{t_{\rm hot}}\sim5.9$ Gyr for galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{11}\,\rm M_{\odot}$. About $80\%$ of the galaxies in our sample have $t_{\rm hot}&gt;t_{\rm cold}$, and the mean values of $t_{\rm hot}-t_{\rm cold}$ also increase with stellar mass, from $0.7_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Gyr in low-mass galaxies ($10^{8.9}\,\rm M_{\odot}&lt;M_*\le10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) to $1.7_{-0.2}^{+0.7}$ Gyr in high-mass galaxies ($10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}&lt;M_*&lt;10^{11.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$). The stellar age is younger in disks than in bulges, on average. This suggests that either the disks formed later and/or that they experienced a more prolonged and extensive period of star formation. Lower-mass spiral galaxies have younger bulges and younger disks, while higher-mass spiral galaxies generally have older bulges, and their disks span a wide range of ages. This is consistent with the scenario in which the bulges in more massive spirals formed earlier than those in less massive spirals.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ emission as a sensitive probe of feedback-regulated LyC escape from dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emission is an exceptionally informative tracer of the life cycle of evolving galaxies and the escape of ionising photons. However, theoretical studies of Ly$\alpha$ emission are often limited by insufficient numerical resolution, incomplete sets of physical models, and poor line-of-sight (LOS) statistics. To overcome such limitations, we utilize here the novel PANDORA suite of high-resolution dwarf galaxy simulations that include a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art physical models for ionizing radiation, magnetic fields, supernova feedback and cosmic rays. We post-process the simulations with the radiative transfer code \textsc{RASCAS} to generate synthetic observations and compare to observed properties of Ly$\alpha$ emitters. Our simulated Ly$\alpha$ haloes are more extended than the spatial region from which the intrinsic emission emanates and our spatially resolved maps of spectral parameters of the Ly$\alpha$ emission are very sensitive to the underlying spatial distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen. Ly$\alpha$ and LyC emission display strongly varying signatures along different LOS depending on how each LOS intersects low-density channels generated by stellar feedback. Comparing galaxies simulated with different physics, we find the Ly$\alpha$ signatures to exhibit systematic offsets determined by the different levels of feedback strength and the clumpiness of the neutral gas. Despite this variance, and regardless of the different physics included in each model, we find universal correlations between Ly$\alpha$ observables and LyC escape fraction, demonstrating a robust connection between Ly$\alpha$ and LyC emission. Ly$\alpha$ observations from a large sample of dwarf galaxies should thus give strong constraints on their stellar feedback-regulated LyC escape and confirm their important role for the reionization of the Universe.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the clustering of quasars and galaxies at $z\approx6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at $z\approx6$. The auto-correlation function of faint $z\approx6$ quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at $z\approx2-4$. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of $z\approx6$ quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in $\approx10^{12.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ halos (corresponding to $\approx5\sigma$ fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low ($\approx1\%$); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos ($\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of $\approx13\%$. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at $z\approx2-6$, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Population of Globular Cluster Streams in Milky Way-type Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin stellar streams originating from globular clusters are among the most sensitive tracers of low-mass dark-matter subhalos. Joint analysis of the entire population of stellar streams will place the most robust constraints on the dark-matter subhalo mass function, and therefore the nature of dark matter. Here we use a hierarchical model of globular cluster formation to forecast the total number, masses and radial distribution of dissolved globular cluster in Milky Way-like galaxies. Furthermore, we generate mock stellar streams from these progenitors' orbital histories taking into account the clusters' formation and accretion time, mass, and metallicity. Out of $\sim$10,000 clusters more massive than $10^4$ M$_{\odot}$, $\sim$9000 dissolved in the central bulge and are fully phase-mixed at the present, while the remaining $\sim$1000 survive as coherent stellar streams. This suggests that the current census of $\sim$80 globular cluster streams in the Milky Way is severely incomplete. Beyond 15 kpc from the Galactic center we are missing hundreds of streams, of which the vast majority are from accreted GCs. Deep Rubin photometry $(g\lesssim27.5)$ would be able to detect these streams, even the most distant ones beyond $&gt; 75$ kpc. We also find that M31 will have an abundance of streams at galactocentric radii of 30-100 kpc. We conclude that future surveys will find a multitude of stellar streams from globular clusters which can be used for dark matter subhalo searches.</description>

      <title>Dust-Evacuated Zones Near Massive Stars: Consequences of Dust Dynamics on Star-forming Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star forming molecular clouds from the {\small STARFORGE} project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold ($\sim 2 M_{\odot}$), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size $\sim 100$ AU. This removal of dust, which interacts with gas through cooling, chemistry, drag, and radiative transfer, alters the gas properties in the region. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the Main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disc and the star. We predict massive stars ($\gtrsim 10 M_{\odot}$) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their discs, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.</description>

Abstract: The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) represents a challenge for some globular cluster (GC) formation models, because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. In order to shed light on our understanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Exploiting the flexibility of effective multi-component $N$-body simulations and relying on state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. We find that, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the implications for GC formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Giant Molecular Clouds: The Effects of Dust Grain Size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dust grain size distribution (GSD) likely varies significantly across star-forming environments in the Universe, but its impact on star formation remains unclear. This ambiguity arises because the GSD interacts non-linearly with processes like heating, cooling, radiation, and chemistry, which have competing effects and varying environmental dependencies. Processes such as grain coagulation, expected to be efficient in dense star-forming regions, reduce the abundance of small grains and increase that of larger grains. Motivated by this, we investigate the effects of similar GSD variations on the thermochemistry and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations spanning a range of cloud masses and grain sizes, which explicitly incorporate the dynamics of dust grains within the full-physics framework of the \SF project. We find that grain size variations significantly alter GMC thermochemistry: with the leading-order effect is that larger grains, under fixed dust mass, GSD dynamic range, and dust-to-gas ratio, result in lower dust opacities. This reduced opacity permits ISRF and internal radiation photons to penetrate more deeply. This leads to rapid gas heating and inhibited star formation. Star formation efficiency is highly sensitive to grain size, with an order of magnitude reduction when grain size dynamic range increases from $10^{-3}$-0.1 $\rm\mu m$ to 0.1-10 $\rm\mu m$. Additionally, warmer gas suppresses low-mass star formation, and decreased opacities result in a greater proportion of gas in diffuse ionized structures.</description>

      <title>Low [O/Fe] Ratio in a Luminous Galaxy at the Early Cosmic Epoch ($z&gt;10$): Signature of Short Delay Time or Bright Hypernovae/Pair-Instability Supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an [O/Fe] ratio of a luminous galaxy GN-z11 at $z=10.60$ derived with the deep public JWST/NIRSpec data. We fit the medium-resolution grating (G140M, G235M, and G395M) data with the model spectra consisting of BPASS-stellar and CLOUDY-nebular spectra in the rest-frame UV wavelength ranges with Fe absorption lines, carefully masking out the other emission and absorption lines in the same manner as previous studies conducted for lower redshift ($z\sim 2-6$) galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements. We obtain an Fe-rich abundance ratio $\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.37^{+0.43}_{-0.22}$, which is confirmed with the independent deep prism data as well as by the classic 1978 index method. This [O/Fe] measurement is lower than measured for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 2-3$. Because $z=10.60$ is an early epoch after the Big Bang ($\sim 430$ Myr) and the first star formation (likely $\sim 200$ Myr), it is difficult to produce Fe by Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) requiring sufficient delay time for white-dwarf formation and gas accretion. The Fe-rich abundance ratio in GN-z11 suggests that the delay time is short, or that the major Fe enrichment is not accomplished by SNeIa but bright hypernovae (BrHNe) and/or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), where the yield models of BrHNe and PISNe explain Fe, Ne, and O abundance ratios of GN-z11. The [O/Fe] measurement is not too low to rule out the connection between GN-z11 and globular clusters (GCs) previously suggested by the nitrogen abundance, but rather supports the connection with a GC population at high [N/O] if a metal dilution process exists.</description>

      <title>Magnetising galaxies with cold inflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z\sim2-3$) galaxies accrete circumgalactic gas through cold streams. Recent high-resolution MHD simulations of these streams showed a significant amplification of the intergalactic magnetic field in the shear layer around them. In this work we estimate the magnetisation of high-redshift galaxies that would result purely due to the accretion of already magnetised gas from cold streams. We use the mass inflow rates and saturated magnetic field values from cold stream simulations as input to a simple analytic model that calculates the galactic magnetic field purely from mass accretion. Our model predicts average magnetic field strengths that exceed $\rm\mu G$ values at $z\sim 2-3$ for inflow rates above $0.1 \, \rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. For high inflow rates, our model results are consistent with the recent detection of a strong magnetic field in $z\gtrsim 2.6$ galaxies. Within the assumptions of our simple model, magnetised cold streams emerge as a viable mechanism for seeding a dynamically important galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The accretion history of the Milky Way IV. Hints of recent star formation in Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are known to be dominated by old stellar populations. This has led to the assumption that their gas-rich progenitors lost their gas during their infall in the Milky Way (MW) halo at distant look-back times. Here, we report a discovery of a tiny but robustly detected population of possibly young ($\sim$ 1 Gyr old) and intermediate-mass ($\rm 1.8 M_{\odot} \le M &lt; 3 M_{\odot}$) stars in MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This was established on the basis of their positions in color-magnitude diagrams, after filtering out the bulk of the foreground MW using Gaia DR3 proper motions. We have considered the possibility that this population is made of evolved blue stragglers. For Sculptor, it seems unlikely, because 95.5% of its stars are older than 8 Gyr, leading to masses smaller than 0.9 M$_{\odot}$. This would only allow blue straggler masses of less than 1.8 M$_{\odot}$, which is much lower than what we observed. Alternatively, it would require the merger of three turnoff stars, which appears even more unlikely. On the other hand, the recent Gaia proper motion measurements of MW dwarf galaxies infer their low binding energies and large angular momenta, pointing to a more recent, $\le$ 3 Gyr, infall. Although the nature of the newly discovered stars still needs further confirmation, we find that they are consistent with the recent infall of the dwarf galaxies into the MW halo, when star formation occurred from the ram pressurization of their gas content before its removal by the hot Galactic corona. The abundance of this plausibly young population of stars is similar to the expectations drawn from hydrodynamical simulations. These results point to a novel origin for MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Detections of interstellar 2-cyanopyrene and 4-cyanopyrene in TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most ubiquitous compounds in the universe, accounting for up to ~25% of all interstellar carbon. Since most unsubstituted PAHs do not possess permanent dipole moments, they are invisible to radio astronomy. Constraining their abundances relies on the detection of polar chemical proxies, such as aromatic nitriles. We report the detection of 2- and 4-cyanopyrene, isomers of the recently detected 1-cyanopyrene. We find that these isomers are present in an abundance ratio of ~2:1:2, which mirrors the number of equivalent sites available for CN addition. We conclude that there is evidence that the cyanopyrene isomers formed by direct CN addition to pyrene under kinetic control in hydrogen-rich gas at 10 K and discuss constraints on the H/CN ratio for PAHs in TMC-1.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2: X. The origin of the interband continuum delays in Mrk 817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local (z=0.0315) AGN Mrk 817, was monitored over more than 500 days with space-borne and ground-based instruments as part of a large international campaign AGN STORM 2. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the broad-band continuum variations using detailed modeling of the broad line region (BLR), several types of disk winds classified by their optical depth, and new numerical simulations. We find that diffuse continuum (DC) emission, with additional contributions from strong and broad emission lines, can explain the continuum lags observed in this source during high and low luminosity phases. Disk illumination by the variable X-ray corona contributes only a small fraction of the observed continuum lags. Our BLR models assume radiation pressure-confined clouds distributed over a distance of 2-122 light days. We present calculated mean-emissivity radii of many emission lines, and DC emission, and suggest a simple, transfer-function-dependent method that ties them to cross-correlation lag determinations. We do not find clear indications for large optical depth winds but identify the signature of lower column density winds. In particular, we associate the shortest observed continuum lags with a combination of tau(1 Ryd) approx. 2 wind and a partly shielded BLR. Even smaller optical depth winds may be associated with X-ray absorption features and with noticeable variations in the width and lags of several high ionization lines like HeII and CIV. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of torus dust emission on the observed lags in the i and z bands.</description>

      <title>Conservative limits on the electric charge of Sgr A* in the Reissner-Nordstrom metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, the gravitational field of an electrically charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body is described by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) metric. Depending on the charge to mass ratio, the solution describes a black hole or a naked singularity. In the naked-singularity regime, a general property of this metric is the existence of a radius, known as the zero-gravity radius, where a test particle would remain at rest. As a consequence of repulsive gravity there is no circular orbit inside this radius, and at least a part of any quasi-stable structure must necessarily lie outside of it. Assuming the iconic torus in the compact source Sgr A* at the Galactic center observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to be the image of a quasi-stationary fluid structure, we provide rigorous constraints in the RN metric on the electric charge-to-mass ratio Q/M of Sgr A*. A comparison between the EHT observations and the space-time zero-gravity radius provides the most conservative limit on the charge of Sgr A* to be |Q/M| &lt; 2.32 in geometrized units. A charged naked singularity respecting this charge-to-mass constraint is consistent with the current EHT observations, if the image is not interpreted as a photon ring.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion Dark Matter with Black Hole Polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion, as a leading dark matter candidate, is the target of many ongoing and proposed experimental searches based on its coupling to photons. Ultralight axions that couple to photons can also cause polarization rotation of light, which the cosmic microwave background can probe. In this work, we show that a large axion field is inevitably developed around supermassive black holes due to the Bose-Einstein condensation of axions, enhancing the induced birefringence effects. Therefore, measuring the modulations of supermassive black hole imaging polarization angles is a strong probe of the axion-photon coupling due to the formation of the axion condensation (axion star) which enhances the axion field. The oscillating axion field around black holes induces polarization rotation on the black hole image, which is detectable and distinguishable from astrophysical effects on the polarization angle, as it exhibits distinctive temporal variability and frequency invariability. In this work, we perform theoretical calculations of the axion star formation rate and the corresponding enhanced axion field value near supermassive black holes. Then, we present the range of axion-photon couplings within the axion mass range $10^{-21}-10^{-16}\,\text{eV}$ that can be probed by the Event Horizon Telescope. The axion parameter space probed by black hole polarimetry will expand with improvements in sensitivity of polarization measurements and more black hole polarimetry targets with determined black hole masses.</description>

      <title>How informative are summaries of the cosmic 21-cm signal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal will bring data-driven advances to studies of the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio telescopes such as the SKA will eventually map the HI fluctuations over the first billion years - the majority of our observable Universe. With such large data volumes, it becomes increasingly important to develop "optimal" summary statistics, allowing us to learn as much as possible about the CD and EoR. In this work we compare the constraining power of several 21-cm summary statistics, using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, $\det F$. Since we do not have an established "fiducial" model for the astrophysics of the first galaxies, we compute the distribution of $\det F$ across the prior volume. Using a large database of cosmic 21-cm lightcones that include realizations of telescope noise, we compare the following summaries: (i) the spherically-averaged power spectrum (1DPS), (ii) the cylindrically-averaged power spectrum (2DPS), (iii) the 2D Wavelet scattering transform (WST), (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN), (v) an information-maximizing neural network (IMNN), and (vi) the combination of 2DPS and IMNN. Our best performing individual summary is the 2DPS, having relatively high Fisher information throughout parameter space. Although capable of achieving the highest Fisher information for some parameter choices, the IMNN does not generalize well, resulting in a broad distribution. Our best results are achieved with the concatenation of the 2DPS and IMNN. The combination of only these two complimentary summaries reduces the recovered parameter variances on average by factors of $\sim$6.5 - 9.5, compared with using each summary independently. Finally, we point out that that the common assumption of a constant covariance matrix when doing Fisher forecasts using 21-cm summaries can significantly underestimate parameter constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical power-law lens mass model parameters, often introducing additional empirical parameters and constraints from high resolution imagery. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) in order to constrain both lens and cosmological parameters for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the timescape model. We then generate large mock data sets to further investigate the choice of cosmology on fitting simple power-law lens models. In agreement with previous results, we find that in combination with single isothermal sphere parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\mathrm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\mathrm v0}\to0.73$ and closely matches values that best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and the cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\mathrm v0}\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for timescape fits to both timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. With larger datasets soon available, separation of cosmology and lens models must be addressed.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Spectral Model of Main Sequence Stars in Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR&gt;50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum (AM) of haloes arises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the surrounding mass distribution. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random overdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more realistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two fundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by Gaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown collapse time such ellipsoidal patches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only, so it does not allow one to infer from it the AM of relaxed haloes. This Paper is the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the halo AM. In the present Paper we use the CUSP formalism, fixing all the open issues of the protohalo AM in the peak theory. That viewpoint is fully accomplished in the sense that not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified to a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also identified to a peak or a hole. This way, we obtain a simple analytic expression for the mean and median Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material are potential ways to further test this finding.</description>
