      <title>Biological computations: limitations of attractor-based formalisms and the need for transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems, from single cells to higher vertebrates, receive a continuous stream of non-stationary inputs that they sense, e.g., via cell surface receptors or sensory organs. Integrating these time-varying, multi-sensory, and often noisy information with memory using complex molecular or neuronal networks, they generate a variety of responses beyond simple stimulus-response association, including avoidance behavior, life-long-learning or social interactions. In a broad sense, these processes can be understood as a type of biological computation. Taking as a basis generic features of biological computations, such as real-time responsiveness or robustness and flexibility of the computation, we highlight the limitations of the current attractor-based framework for understanding computations in biological systems. We argue that frameworks based on transient dynamics away from attractors are better suited for the description of computations performed by neuronal and signaling networks. In particular, we discuss how quasi-stable transient dynamics from ghost states that emerge at criticality have a promising potential for developing an integrated framework of computations, that can help us understand how living system actively process information and learn from their continuously changing environment.</description>
