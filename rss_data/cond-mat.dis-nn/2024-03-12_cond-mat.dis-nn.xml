      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ir growth pressure on the domain wall dynamics in Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical response of magnetic domain walls to external magnetic fields in ultra-thin multilayer magnetic films is determined not only by the composition and thickness of the layers but also by the growth conditions. Growth conditions can induce significant structural changes inside the layers and at the interfaces between them, affecting in particular the dynamics of domain walls, their mobility, elastic tension, and the pinning forces acting on them. In this work, we focus specifically on the effect of Ir layer growth pressure in Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta ultra-thin multilayers films. Measurements of the DC magnetic properties, domain wall velocity and domain morphology in the creep regime for both constant and alternating field pulses, were performed for a batch of samples where the Ir layer was grown at different pressures. We find that the saturation magnetization, the effective anisotropy constant and the domain wall surface tension grow with increasing pressure and saturate at a threshold pressure, while the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field and the strength of the disorder remain practically unaltered over the range of pressures considered.</description>

      <title>A Spin model for global flat-foldability of random origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the problem of determining flat-foldability of the origami diagram onto the ground-state search problem of spin glass model on random graphs. If the origami diagram is locally flat-foldable around each vertex, a pre-folded diagram, showing the planar-positional relationship of the facet, can be obtained. For remaining combinatorial problem on layer ordering of facets can be described as a spin model. A spin variable is assigned for the layer-ordering of each pair of facets which have an overlap in the pre-folded diagram. The interactions to prohibit the intrusion of each facet into the other component of the same origami diagram are introduced among two or four spins. The flat-foldability of the diagram is closely related to the (non-)existence of frustrated loops on the spin model with the interactions on the random (hyper)graph.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of Neural Network Quantum States (NNQS) have made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NNQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields interpretable features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NNQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of condensed matter systems using NNQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>A multiscale cavity method for sublinear-rank symmetric matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a statistical model for symmetric matrix factorization with additive Gaussian noise in the high-dimensional regime where the rank $M$ of the signal matrix to infer scales with its size $N$ as $M = o(N^{1/10})$. Allowing for a $N$-dependent rank offers new challenges and requires new methods. Working in the Bayesian-optimal setting, we show that whenever the signal has i.i.d. entries the limiting mutual information between signal and data is given by a variational formula involving a rank-one replica symmetric potential. In other words, from the information-theoretic perspective, the case of a (slowly) growing rank is the same as when $M = 1$ (namely, the standard spiked Wigner model). The proof is primarily based on a novel multiscale cavity method allowing for growing rank along with some information-theoretic identities on worst noise for the Gaussian vector channel. We believe that the cavity method developed here will play a role in the analysis of a broader class of inference and spin models where the degrees of freedom are large arrays instead of vectors.</description>

      <title>Anderson mobility edge as a percolation transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The location of the mobility edge is a long standing problem in Anderson localization. In this paper, we show that the effective confining potential introduced in the localization landscape (LL) theory predicts the onset of delocalization in 3D tight-binding models, in a large part of the energy-disorder diagram. Near the edge of the spectrum, the eigenstates are confined inside the basins of the LL-based potential. The delocalization transition corresponds to the progressive merging of these basins resulting in the percolation of this classically-allowed region throughout the system. This approach, shown to be valid both in the cases of uniform and binary disorders despite their very different phase diagrams, allows us to reinterpret the Anderson transition in the tight-binding model: the mobility edge appears to be composed of two branches, one being understood as a percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density Classification For Environment Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterising the system-environment interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such information is key to determining the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage the potential of machine learning techniques to reconstruct the features of the environment. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by an artificial neural network to infer the main features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant examples of spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter of the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby distinguishing between different forms of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Localization of Dirac modes in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Higgs model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between localization of low-lying Dirac modes and Polyakov-loop ordering in the lattice $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Higgs model at finite temperature, probed with the staggered Dirac operator. After mapping out the phase diagram of the model at a fixed temporal extension in lattice units, we study the localization properties of the low-lying modes of the staggered Dirac operator, how these properties change across the various transitions, and how these modes correlate with the gauge and Higgs fields. We find localized low modes in the deconfined and in the Higgs phase, where the Polyakov loop is strongly ordered, but in both cases they disappear as one crosses over to the confined phase. Our findings confirm the general expectations of the "sea/islands" picture, and the more detailed expectations of its refined version concerning the favorable locations of localized modes, also in the presence of dynamical scalar matter.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the mobility edge and taste-degeneracy effects in high-temperature lattice QCD with staggered quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of taste degeneracy on the continuum scaling of the localization properties of the staggered Dirac operator in high-temperature QCD using numerical simulations on the lattice, focusing in particular on the position of the mobility edge separating localized and delocalized modes at the low end of the spectrum. We find that, if the continuum limit is approached at fixed spatial volume, the restoration of taste symmetry leads to sizeable systematic effects on estimates for the mobility edge obtained from spectral statistics, which become larger and larger as the lattice spacing is decreased. Such systematics, however, are found to decrease if the volume is increased at fixed lattice spacing. We argue that spectral statistics estimate correctly the position of the mobility edge in the thermodynamic limit at fixed spacing, and support this with an independent numerical analysis based directly on the properties of the Dirac eigenvectors, that are unaffected by taste degeneracy. We then provide a theoretical argument justifying the exchange of the thermodynamic and continuum limits when studying localization. This allows us to use spectral statistics to determine the position of the mobility edge, and to obtain a controlled continuum extrapolation of the mobility edge for the first time.</description>
