      <title>Numerical PDE solvers outperform neural PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators, U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust, efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification of parametric PDEs.</description>

      <title>Structure Preserving Finite Volume Schemes on Voronoi Grids: Curl Involution, Asymptotic Limit and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new curl-free and thermodynamically compatible finite volume scheme on Voronoi grids to solve compressible heat conducting flows written in first-order hyperbolic form. The approach is based on the definition of compatible discrete curl-grad operators, exploiting the triangular nature of the dual mesh. We design a cell solver reminiscent of the nodal solvers used in Lagrangian schemes to discretize the evolution equation for the thermal impulse vector, and we demonstrate that the resulting numerical scheme ensures energy conservation, local non-negative entropy production, as well as asymptotic consistency with the classical Fourier law in the stiff relaxation limit. A novel technique is proposed to transfer residuals from the dual to the primal mesh as subfluxes, which eventually yields the construction of entropy compatible semi-discrete methods. The scheme and its properties are validated on a set of numerical test cases.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free Preserving Mix Finite Element Methods for Fourth-order Active Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with mixed finite element method (FEM) for solving the two-dimensional, nonlinear fourth-order active fluid equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w=-\Delta u$, the original fourth problem is transformed into a system of second-order equations, which relaxes the regularity requirements of standard $H^2$-conforming finite spaces. To further enhance the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, an additional auxiliary variable $\phi$, treated analogously to the pressure, is introduced, leading to a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element scheme. A fully discrete scheme is then constructed by coupling the spatial mixed FEM with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme and corresponding error estimates can be rigorously proven under appropriate assumptions due to unconditional non-linear stability and second-order accuracy of the DLN method. To enhance computational efficiency in practice, we develop an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a minimum-dissipation criterion. Several numerical experiments are displayed to fully validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme for complex active fluid simulations.</description>

      <title>Variational inference and density estimation with non-negative tensor train</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an efficient numerical approach for compressing a high-dimensional discrete distribution function into a non-negative tensor train (NTT) format. The two settings we consider are variational inference and density estimation, whereby one has access to either the unnormalized analytic formula of the distribution or the samples generated from the distribution. In particular, the compression is done through a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we use existing subroutines to encode the distribution function in a tensor train format. In the second stage, we use an NTT ansatz to fit the obtained tensor train. For the NTT fitting procedure, we use a log barrier term to ensure the positivity of each tensor component, and then utilize a second-order alternating minimization scheme to accelerate convergence. In practice, we observe that the proposed NTT fitting procedure exhibits drastically faster convergence than an alternative multiplicative update method that has been previously proposed. Through challenging numerical experiments, we show that our approach can accurately compress target distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Discretization and Model Reduction for Energy-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate discretization strategies for a recently introduced class of energy-based models. The model class encompasses classical port-Hamiltonian systems, generalized gradient flows, and certain systems with algebraic constraints. Our framework combines existing ideas from the literature and systematically addresses temporal discretization, spatial discretization, and model order reduction, ensuring that all resulting schemes are dissipation-preserving in the sense of a discrete dissipation inequality. For this, we use a Petrov-Galerkin ansatz together with appropriate projections. Numerical results for a nonlinear circuit model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient and stable diffusion generated methods for ground state computation in Bose--Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates numerical methods for approximating the ground state of Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs) by introducing two relaxed formulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii energy functional. These formulations achieve first- and second-order accuracy with respect to the relaxation parameter \( \tau \), and are shown to converge to the original energy functional as \( \tau \to 0 \). A key feature of the relaxed functionals is their concavity, which ensures that local minima lie on the boundary of the concave hull. This property prevents energy increases during constraint normalization and enables the development of energy-dissipative algorithms. Numerical methods based on sequential linear programming are proposed, accompanied by rigorous analysis of their stability with respect to the relaxed energy. To enhance computational efficiency, an adaptive strategy is introduced, dynamically refining solutions obtained with larger relaxation parameters to achieve higher accuracy with smaller ones. Numerical experiments demonstrate the stability, convergence, and energy dissipation of the proposed methods, while showcasing the adaptive strategy's effectiveness in improving computational performance.</description>

      <title>Solving Boundary Handling Analytically in Two Dimensions for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully analytic approach for evaluating boundary integrals in two dimensions for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Conventional methods often rely on boundary particles or wall re-normalization approaches derived from applying the divergence theorem, whereas our method directly evaluates the area integrals for SPH kernels and gradients over triangular boundaries. This direct integration strategy inherently accommodates higher-order boundary conditions, such as piecewise cubic fields defined via Finite Element stencils, enabling analytic and flexible coupling with mesh-based solvers. At the core of our approach is a general solution for compact polynomials of arbitrary degree over triangles by decomposing the boundary elements into elementary integrals that can be solved with closed-form solutions. We provide a complete, closed-form solution for these generalized integrals, derived by relating the angular components to Chebyshev polynomials and solving the resulting radial integral via a numerically stable evaluation of the Gaussian hypergeometric function $_2F_1$. Our solution is robust and adaptable and works regardless of triangle geometries and kernel functions. We validate the accuracy against high-precision numerical quadrature rules, as well as in problems with known exact solutions. We provide an open-source implementation of our general solution using differentiable programming to facilitate the adoption of our approach to SPH and other contexts that require analytic integration over polygonal domains. Our analytic solution outperforms existing numerical quadrature rules for this problem by up to five orders of magnitude, for integrals and their gradients, while providing a flexible framework to couple arbitrary triangular meshes analytically to Lagrangian schemes, building a strong foundation for addressing several grand challenges in SPH and beyond.</description>

      <title>Non-periodic Fourier propagation algorithms for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) often use Fourier or polynomial spectral expansions on either uniform and non-uniform grids. However, while very widely used, especially for slowly-varying solutions, non-uniform spatial grids can give larger spatial discretization errors if the solutions change rapidly in space. Here, we implement a Fourier method that employs fast trigonometric expansions on a uniform grid with non-periodic boundaries using fast discrete sine transforms (DST) or/and discrete cosine transforms (DCT) to solve parabolic PDEs. We implement this method in two ways: either using a Fourier spectral derivative or a Fourier interaction picture approach. These methods can treat vector fields with a combination of Dirichlet and/or Neumann boundary conditions in one or more space dimensions. We use them to solve a variety of PDEs with analytical solutions, including the Peregrine solitary wave solution. For the 1D heat equation problem, our method with an interaction picture is accurate up to the machine precision. A soluble example of an SPDE with non-periodic boundaries is also treated. We compare the results obtained from these algorithms with those from publicly available solvers that use either polynomial spectral or finite element methods. For problems with solutions that vary rapidly in space, our method outperforms the other methods by recording lower spatial discretization errors, as well being faster in many cases, due to the efficiency improvements given by fast transforms.</description>

      <title>Fast multipole method for the Laplace equation in half plane with Robin boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast multipole method (FMM) for solving the two-dimensional Laplace equation in a half-plane with Robin boundary conditions. The method is based on a novel expansion theory for the reaction component of the Green's function. By applying the Fourier transform, the reaction field component is obtained in a Sommerfeld-type integral form. We derive far-field approximations and corresponding shifting and translation operators from the Fourier integral representation. The FMM for the reaction component is then developed by using the new far-field approximations incorporated into the classic FMM framework in which the tree structure is constructed from the original and image charges. Combining this with the standard FMM for the free-space components, we develop a fast algorithm to compute the interaction of the half plane Laplace Green's function. We prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence, similar to the free-space FMM. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate that the FMM achieves $O(N)$ computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving nodal DG method for Euler equations with gravity II: general equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an entropy-stable nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the Euler equations with gravity, which is also well-balanced with respect to general equilibrium solutions, including both hydrostatic and moving equilibria. The core of our approach lies in a novel treatment of the gravitational source term, combining entropy-conservative numerical fluxes with a linear entropy correction. In addition, the proposed formulation is carefully designed to ensure compatibility with a positivity-preserving limiter. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the accuracy and structure-preserving properties of the proposed scheme. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the robustness and efficiency of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Shape and Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to introduce the paradigm of distributional robustness from the field of convex optimization to tackle optimal design problems under uncertainty. We consider realistic situations where the physical model, and thereby the cost function of the design to be minimized depend on uncertain parameters. The probability distribution of the latter is itself known imperfectly, through a nominal law, reconstructed from a few observed samples. The distributionally robust optimal design problem is an intricate bilevel program which consists in minimizing the worst value of a statistical quantity of the cost function (typically, its expectation) when the law of the uncertain parameters belongs to a certain ``ambiguity set''. We address three classes of such problems: firstly, this ambiguity set is made of the probability laws whose Wasserstein distance to the nominal law is less than a given threshold; secondly, the ambiguity set is based on the first- and second-order moments of the actual and nominal probability laws. Eventually, a statistical quantity of the cost other than its expectation is made robust with respect to the law of the parameters, namely its conditional value at risk. Using techniques from convex duality, we derive tractable, single-level reformulations of these problems, framed over augmented sets of variables. Our methods are essentially agnostic of the optimal design framework; they are described in a unifying abstract framework, before being applied to multiple situations in density-based topology optimization and in geometric shape optimization. Several numerical examples are discussed in two and three space dimensions to appraise the features of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>The Performance of Low-Synchronization Variants of Reorthogonalized Block Classical Gram--Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous applications, such as Krylov subspace solvers, make extensive use of the block classical Gram-Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized variants for orthogonalizing a set of vectors. For large-scale problems in distributed memory settings, the communication cost, particularly the global synchronization cost, is a major performance bottleneck. In recent years, many low-synchronization BCGS variants have been proposed in an effort to reduce the number of synchronization points. The work [E. Carson, Y. Ma, arXiv preprint 2411.07077] recently proposed stable one-synchronization and two-synchronization variants of BCGS, i.e., BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S. In this work, we evaluate the performance of BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S on a distributed memory system compared to other well-known low-synchronization BCGS variants. In comparison to the classical reorthogonalized BCGS algorithm (BCGSI+), numerical experiments demonstrate that BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S can achieve up to 4 times and 2 times speedups, respectively, and perform similarly to other (less stable) one-synchronization and two-synchronization variants. BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S are therefore recommended as the best choice in practice for computing an economic QR factorization on distributed memory systems due to their superior stability when compared to other variants with the same synchronization cost.</description>

      <title>A novel fast iterative moment method for near-continuum flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel fast iterative moment method for the steady-state simulation of near-continuum flows, which are modeled by the high-order moment system derived from the Boltzmann-BGK equation. The fast convergence of the present method is mainly achieved by alternately solving the moment system and the hydrodynamic equations with consistent constitutive relations and boundary conditions. To be specific, the consistent hydrodynamic equations are solved in each alternating iteration to obtain improved predictions of macroscopic quantities, which are subsequently utilized to expedite the evolution of the moment system. Additionally, a semi-implicit scheme treating the collision term implicitly is introduced for the moment system. The resulting alternating iteration can be further accelerated by employing the Gauss-Seidel method with a cell-by-cell sweeping strategy. It is also noteworthy that such an alternating iteration works well with the nonlinear multigrid method. Numerical experiments for planar Couette flow, shock structure, and lid-driven cavity flow are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed fast iterative moment method. All results show impressive efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Random Projection Neural Networks for ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a linear stability analysis of physics-informed random projection neural networks (PI-RPNNs), for the numerical solution of {the initial value problem (IVP)} of (stiff) ODEs. We begin by proving that PI-RPNNs are uniform approximators of the solution to ODEs. We then provide a constructive proof demonstrating that PI-RPNNs offer consistent and asymptotically stable numerical schemes, thus convergent schemes. In particular, we prove that multi-collocation PI-RPNNs guarantee asymptotic stability. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical solutions of benchmark examples including indicative comparisons with the backward Euler method, the midpoint method, the trapezoidal rule, the 2-stage Gauss scheme, and the 2- and 3-stage Radau schemes.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds of the SE and DE formulas for integrals with logarithmic and algebraic singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19755</link>

Abstract: The single exponential (SE) and double exponential (DE) formulas are widely recognized as efficient quadrature formulas for evaluating integrals with endpoint singularity. For integrals exhibiting algebraic singularity, explicit error bounds in a computable form have been provided, enabling computations with guaranteed accuracy. Such explicit error bounds have also been provided for integrals exhibiting logarithmic singularity. However, these error bounds have two points to be discussed. The first point is on overestimation of divergence speed of logarithmic singularity. The second point is on the case where there exist both logarithmic and algebraic singularity. To address these issues, this study provides new error bounds for integrals with logarithmic and algebraic singularity. Although existing and new error bounds described above pertain to integrals over the finite interval, the SE and DE formulas are also applicable to integrals over the semi-infinite interval. On the basis of the new results, this study provides new error bounds for integrals over the semi-infinite interval with logarithmic and algebraic singularity at the origin.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition strategy for natural imposition of mixed boundary conditions in port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, a finite element scheme to impose mixed boundary conditions without introducing Lagrange multipliers is presented for wave propagation phenomena described as port-Hamiltonian systems. The strategy relies on finite element exterior calculus and domain decomposition to interconnect two systems with different causalities. The spatial domain is split into two parts by introducing an arbitrary interface. Each subdomain is discretized with a mixed finite element formulation that introduces a uniform boundary condition in a natural way as the input. In each subdomain the spaces are selected from a finite element subcomplex to obtain a stable discretization. The two systems are then interconnected together by making use of a feedback interconnection. This is achieved by discretizing the boundary inputs using appropriate spaces that couple the two formulations. The final systems includes all boundary conditions explicitly and does not contain any Lagrange multiplier. Each subdomain is integrated using an implicit midpoint scheme in an uncoupled way from the other by means of a leapfrog scheme. The proposed strategy is tested on two different examples: the Euler-Bernoulli beam and the wave equation. Numerical tests assess the conservation properties of the scheme and the effectiveness of the methodology.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.
  In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation blocks.</description>

      <title>An exponential integrator multicontinuum homogenization method for fractional diffusion problem with multiscale coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and fully discretized method for solving the time fractional diffusion equation with high-contrast multiscale coefficients. We establish the homogenized equation using a multicontinuum approach and employ the exponential integrator method for time discretization. The multicontinuum upscaled model captures the physical characteristics of the solution for the high-contrast multiscale problem, including averages and gradient effects in each continuum at the coarse scale. We then use the exponential integration method for the nonlocal time fractional derivative and it can handle semilinear problem in an efficient way. Convergence analysis of the numerical scheme is provided, along with illustrative numerical examples. Our results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and improved stability for varying order of fractional derivatives.</description>

      <title>Interpolation in Polynomial Spaces of p-Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently introduced the Fast Newton Transform (FNT), an algorithm for performing multivariate Newton interpolation in downward closed polynomial spaces of spatial dimension $m$. In this work, we analyze the FNT in the context of a specific family of downward closed sets $A_{m,n,p}$, defined as all multi-indices with $\ell^p$ norm less than $n$ with $p \in [0,\infty]$. These sets induce the downward closed polynomial space $\Pi_{m,n,p}$, within which the FNT algorithm achieves a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|A_{m,n,p}|mn)$. We show that this setting, compared to tensor product spaces, yields an improvement in complexity by a factor $\rho_{m,n,p}$, which decays super exponentially with increasing spatial dimension when $m \lesssim n^p$. Additionally, we demonstrate the construction of the hierarchical scheme employed by the FNT and showcase its performance to compute activity scores in sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>1/2 order convergence rate of Euler-type methods for time-changed stochastic differential equations with super-linearly growing drift and diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence rates of two Euler-type methods for a class of time-changed stochastic differential equations with super-linearly growing drift and diffusion coefficients. Building upon existing research, we adapt the backward Euler method to time-changed stochastic differential equations where both coefficients exhibit super-linear growth and introduce an explicit counterpart, the projected Euler method. It is shown that both methods achieve the optimal strong convergence rate of order 1/2 in the mean-square sense for this class of equations. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Cavitation Dynamics on Free Ogee Spillways Using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating complex hydraulic conditions, particularly two-phase flows over spillway chutes, can be achieved with high accuracy using three-dimensional numerical models. This study investigates the potential for vacuum generation and cavitation phenomena on the Aghchai Dam service spillway through numerical simulations conducted in Flow-3D. The analysis focuses on two specific flow rates, 4400 and 1065 cubic meters per second, as determined by experimental data. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to accurately calculate the free surface flow. Simulation results at a discharge rate of 4400 cubic meters per second indicate a high likelihood of cavitation at critical locations, including the ogee curve and the angle transition in the chute channel. These areas require specific mitigation measures to prevent cavitation-induced damage. In contrast, at the lower flow rate of 1065 cubic meters per second, the risk of cavitation is minimal due to reduced flow velocity and the absence of flow separation from the bed. The numerical findings align closely with empirical observations, demonstrating the reliability of the simulation approach in predicting cavitation behavior.</description>

      <title>HiPreNets: High-Precision Neural Networks through Progressive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with Just-In-Time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>
