      <title>Quantum Field Theory Between Rigor and Pragmatism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the foundational framework of particle physics, has long existed in a state of tension between empirical success and mathematical rigor. Conventional QFT (CQFT), which underpins the Standard Model, offers unparalleled predictive accuracy but relies on inconsistent and ad hoc methods. In contrast, axiomatic QFT (AxQFT) aspires to a consistent, mathematically rigorous foundation, yet lacks empirical applicability. This paper introduces the heuristic vehicle of a realism quotient to model and navigate this tension, framing it as a dynamic balance between realism and instrumentalism in the mathematical structures of physical theories. By reconstructing the historical development of QFT and extrapolating its trajectory, the paper offers both a descriptive account of theoretical progress and a normative proposal: that CQFT and AxQFT must converge to address selected challenges of physics beyond the Standard Model. The model also contributes to broader debates in scientific realism, offering a structured framework for understanding the interplay between empirical adequacy and conceptual robustness and mathematical rigour in foundational physics.</description>

      <title>Non-individuality and experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter acknowledges a gap between the ``non-individuals'' interpretation of quantum mechanics and our world of experience, and begins to bridge it. Section 1 states the problem with Abner Shimony's ``Phenomenological principle''; section 2 briefly presents the interpretation with connection to standard quantum mechanics; section 3 presents the measurement problem in connection with the Phenomenological principle, the standard way out of it, and why the ``non-individuals'' interpretation of quantum mechanics should not follow it; section 4 finally shows two closed venues for such an interpretation (Bohmian mechanics and the Modal-Hamiltonian Interpretation), and two alternatives for such it (Everettian quantum mechanics and spontaneous collapse theories).</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD): An Informational Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has transformed our understanding of reality, yet deep philosophical puzzles remain unresolved. Is there a consistent way to describe quantum measurement, the emergence of space and time, and the role of observers within one coherent ontology? This paper introduces Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), an interpretation that places relationships and information, not isolated objects, at the foundation of physics. Unlike traditional views, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or hidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality, instead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational contexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by replacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests on five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and observer-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than existing as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of quantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated information, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence without special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic structural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe consists entirely of informational relations. It avoids collapsing into relativism or solipsism by ensuring intersubjective agreement through physical interactions. Ultimately, RQD may offer a unified picture in which quantum mechanics, spacetime, and observers are no longer separate domains but aspects of one interconnected informational web.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>
