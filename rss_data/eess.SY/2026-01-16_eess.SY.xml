      <title>Collision Avoidance for Non-Cooperative Multi-Swarm Coverage Control with Bounded Disturbance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm for collision-free coverage control of multiple non-cooperating swarms in the presence of bounded disturbances. A new methodology is introduced that accounts for uncertainties in disturbance measurements. The proposed methodology is used to develop an algorithm that ensures collision-free motion in multi-swarm coverage control, specifically for cases where disturbances are present and their measurements are subject to bounded uncertainty. The theoretical results are validated through simulations of multiple swarms that independently aim to cover a given region in an environment with disturbances.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonovershooting Control of Strict-Feedback Systems Under Unknown Control Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the nonovershooting control problem for strict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown control direction. We propose a method that integrates extremum seeking with Lie bracket-based design to achieve approximately nonovershooting tracking. The approach ensures that arbitrary reference trajectories can be tracked from below for any initial condition, with the overshoot reducible to arbitrarily small levels through parameter tuning. The method further provides a mechanism for enforcing high-relative-degree nonovershooting constraints in safety-critical scenarios involving unknown control directions.</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Deep RL Dispatcher for Post-Storm Distribution System Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural hazards such as hurricanes and floods damage power grid equipment, forcing operators to replan restoration repeatedly as new information becomes available. This paper develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) dispatcher that serves as a real-time decision engine for crew-to-repair assignments. We model restoration as a sequential, information-revealing process and learn an actor-critic policy over compact features such as component status, travel/repair times, crew availability, and marginal restoration value. A feasibility mask blocks unsafe or inoperable actions, such as power flow limits, switching rules, and crew-time constraints, before they are applied. To provide realistic runtime inputs without relying on heavy solvers, we use lightweight surrogates for wind and flood intensities, fragility-based failure, spatial clustering of damage, access impairments, and progressive ticket arrivals. In simulated hurricane and flood events, the learned policy updates crew decisions in real time as new field reports arrive. Because the runtime logic is lightweight, it improves online performance (energy-not-supplied, critical-load restoration time, and travel distance) compared with mixed-integer programs and standard heuristics. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 13- and 123-bus feeders with mixed hurricane/flood scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Computation and Approximation of Backward Reachable Sets for Max-Plus Linear Systems using Polyhedras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates reachability analysis for max-plus linear systems (MPLS), an important class of dynamical systems that model synchronization and delay phenomena in timed discrete-event systems. We specifically focus on backward reachability analysis, i.e., determining the set of states that can reach a given target set within a certain number of steps. Computing backward reachable sets presents significant challenges due to the non-convexity of max-plus dynamics and the complexity of set complement operations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approximation framework that efficiently computes backward reachable sets by exploiting the structure of tropical polyhedra. Our approach reformulates the problem as a sequence of symbolic operations and approximates non-convex target sets through closure operations on unions of tropical polyhedra. We develop a systematic algorithm that constructs both outer (M-form) and inner (V-form) representations of the resulting sets, incorporating extremal filtering to reduce computational complexity. The proposed method offers a scalable alternative to traditional DBM-based approaches, enabling reliable approximate backward reachability analysis for general target regions in MPLS.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Digital Twin Technologies: All-Photonics Networks-as-a-Service for Data Center Xchange in the Era of AI [Invited Tutorial]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data center exchange (Data Center Xchange, DCX) architecture for all-photonics networks-as-a-service in distributed data center infrastructures, enabling the creation of a virtual large-scale data center by directly interconnecting distributed data centers in metropolitan areas. Key requirements for such an architecture are identified: support for low-latency operations, scalability, reliability, and flexibility within a single network architecture; the ability to add new operator-driven automation functionalities based on an open networking approach; and the ability to control and manage remotely deployed transponders connected via access links with unknown physical parameters. We propose a set of technologies that enable digital twin operations for optical networks, including a cloud-native architecture for coherent transceivers, remote transponder control, fast end-to-end optical path provisioning, transceiver-based physical-parameter estimation incorporating digital longitudinal monitoring, and optical line system calibration, demonstrating their feasibility through field validations.</description>

      <title>HyMGP: A Customized MILP-Based Tool for Techno-Economic Planning of Islanded Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a customized microgrid planning algorithm and tool, HyMGP, for remote sites in arid regions, which is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. HyMGP is compared with HOMER Pro to evaluate its performance in optimizing the sizing of microgrid components, including photovoltaic panels (PVs), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), for remote and off-grid applications. The study focuses on a standalone microgrid in the Saudi Arabia, considering high solar irradiance, limited wind availability, and a constant load profile composed of continuous cathodic protection and daytime cooling. In the simulation environment, comparisons with HOMER solutions demonstrate the advantages of HyMGP, which provides optimal and more flexible solutions by allowing user-defined component specifications and strictly enforcing all constraints. Further analysis shows that incorporating wind turbines reduces the Net Present Cost (NPC) by decreasing the required PV and battery capacities. Increasing battery autonomy leads to a higher NPC in both PV-only and hybrid systems due to the need for larger storage. Finally, lithium iron phosphate (Li-ion LFP) batteries are found to be more cost effective than lead acid, offering lower NPCs due to their longer lifespan, deeper discharge capability, and fewer replacement cycles.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control of Thermo-Hydraulic Systems Using Primal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonizing the global energy supply requires more efficient heating and cooling systems. Model predictive control enhances the operation of cooling and heating systems but depends on accurate system models, often based on control volumes. We present an automated framework including time discretization to generate model predictive controllers for such models. To ensure scalability, a primal decomposition exploiting the model structure is applied. The approach is validated on an underground heating system with varying numbers of states, demonstrating the primal decomposition's advantage regarding scalability.</description>

      <title>Single-Feed Circularly Polarized Super Realized Gain Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a super realized gain, circularly polarized strip-crossed dipole antenna operating at 3.5 GHz. Superdirective behavior is achieved by leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling through careful adjustment of the strip dimensions. The antenna features a single driven element, with the other element passively loaded with a reactive impedance. The structure is optimized to maximize left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) realized gain, ensuring high polarization purity and good impedance matching. The optimized design exhibits a 50 $\Omega$ impedance bandwidth of 3.29 - 4.17 GHz (23.75%) and an axial-ratio bandwidth of 3.43 - 3.57 GHz (4%). At 3.5 GHz, the antenna achieves a peak realized gain of 6.1 dB ($ka \approx 1.65$), with an axial ratio of 1.4 dB. These results demonstrate that circular polarization and superdirectivity can be simultaneously realized in a geometrically simple, low-profile ($0.15\lambda$) antenna, rendering it suitable for integration into compact sub-6~GHz wireless and sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Safe Trajectory Gradient Flow Control of a Grid-Interfacing Inverter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-interfacing inverters serve as the interface between renewable energy resources and the electric power grid, offering fast, programmable control capabilities. However, their operation is constrained by hardware limitations, such as bounds on the current magnitude. Existing control methods for these systems often neglect these constraints during controller design and instead rely on ad hoc limiters, which can introduce instability or degrade performance. In this work, we present a control framework that directly incorporates constraints into the control of a voltage-source inverter. We propose a safe trajectory gradient flow controller, which applies the safe gradient flow method to a rolling horizon trajectory optimization problem to ensure that the states remain within a safe set defined by the constraints while directing the trajectory towards an optimal equilibrium point of a nonlinear program. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can drive the outputs of a simulated inverter system to optimal values and maintain state constraints, even when using a limited number of optimization steps per control cycle.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Perfectly Secure Collaborative Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a perfectly secure matrix multiplication (PSMM) protocol for multiparty computation (MPC) of $\mathrm{A}^{\top}\mathrm{B}$ over finite fields. The proposed scheme guarantees correctness and information-theoretic privacy against threshold-bounded, semi-honest colluding agents, under explicit local storage constraints. Our scheme encodes submatrices as evaluations of sparse masking polynomials and combines coefficient alignment with Beaver-style randomness to ensure perfect secrecy. We demonstrate that any colluding set of parties below the security threshold observes uniformly random shares, and that the recovery threshold is optimal, matching existing information-theoretic limits. Building on this framework, we introduce a learning-augmented extension that integrates tensor-decomposition-based local block multiplication, capturing both classical and learned low-rank methods. We demonstrate that the proposed learning-based PSMM preserves privacy and recovery guarantees for MPC, while providing scalable computational efficiency gains (up to $80\%$) as the matrix dimensions grow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface circuits are the key components that enable the hybrid integration of superconductor and semiconductor digital electronics. The design requirements of superconductor-semiconductor interface circuits vary depending on the application, such as high-performance classical computing, superconducting quantum computing, and digital signal processing. In this survey, various interface circuits are categorized based on the working principle and structure. The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined. Accordingly, parameters such as the data rate, output voltage, power dissipation, layout area, thermal/heat load of cryogenic cables, and bit-error rate are considered.</description>

      <title>Emergency Department Patient Flow Optimization with an Alternative Care Threshold Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.</description>

      <title>Online identification of nonlinear time-varying systems with uncertain information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.</description>

      <title>A user subscription model in mobile radio access networks with network slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network slicing is an architectural enabling technology that logically decouples the current cellular networks into infrastructure providers (InPs) and Network Slice Tenants (NSTs). The network resources (e.g., radio access resources at each cell) are owned by the InP, and are shared by the NSTs to provide a service to their mobile users. In this context, we proposed a business model that includes resource allocation and user subscription to NSTs in a competitive setting, and provides, among other things, closed-form expressions for the subscription indicators in equilibrium of each NST at each cell. This model relies on the widely adopted logit model to characterize user subscriptions. However, as a consequence of user mobility and radio propagation, some of the underlying assumptions in the logit model do not hold. Therefore, further research is needed to assess the accuracy of the results provided by the logit model in a mobile radio scenario. We carry out a thorough evaluation of the validity of the model by comparing its results against those obtained through computer simulation. Our simulation model includes complete and realistic characterizations of user mobility and radio propagation. From the results, we conclude in most cases the logit model provides valid results in a mobile radio scenario.</description>

Abstract: Smart inverters are instrumental in the integration of distributed energy resources into the electric grid. Such inverters rely on communication layers for continuous control and monitoring, potentially exposing them to cyber-physical attacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). We propose to construct a defense strategy against a priori unknown FDIAs with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The first agent is an adversary that simulates and discovers various FDIA strategies, while the second agent is a defender in charge of detecting and locating FDIAs. This approach enables the defender to be trained against new FDIAs continuously generated by the adversary. In addition, we show that the detection skills of an MARL defender can be combined with those of a supervised offline defender through a transfer learning approach. Numerical experiments conducted on a distribution and transmission system demonstrate that: a) the proposed MARL defender outperforms the offline defender against adversarial attacks; b) the transfer learning approach makes the MARL defender capable against both synthetic and unseen FDIAs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Economic Model Predictive Control: Performance Guarantees for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the economic performance of nonlinear constrained systems subject to uncertain time-varying parameters and bounded disturbances. In particular, we propose an adaptive economic model predictive control (MPC) framework that: (i) directly minimizes transient economic costs, (ii) addresses parametric uncertainty through online model adaptation, (iii) determines optimal setpoints online, and (iv) ensures robustness by using a tube-based approach. The proposed design ensures recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and a transient performance bound. In case the disturbances have a finite energy and the parameter variations have a finite path length, the asymptotic average performance is (approximately) not worse than the performance obtained when operating at the best reachable steady-state. We highlight performance benefits in a numerical example involving a chemical reactor with unknown time-invariant and time-varying parameters.</description>

      <title>Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient trajectory generation is crucial for autonomous systems; however, current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, particularly when the onboard sensors require equidistant temporal sampling. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through the Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish the feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Euclidean Distance Field Properties for Fast and Safe 3D planning with a modified Lazy Theta*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the FS-Planner, a fast graph-search planner based on a modified Lazy Theta* algorithm that exploits the analytical properties of Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs). We introduce a new cost function that integrates an EDF-based term proven to satisfy the triangle inequality, enabling efficient parent selection and reducing computation time while generating safe paths with smaller heading variations. We also derive an analytic approximation of the EDF integral along a segment and analyze the influence of the line-of-sight limit on the approximation error, motivating the use of a bounded visibility range. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based neighbour-selection mechanism that decreases the number of explored nodes and improves computational performance without degrading safety or path quality. The FS-Planner produces safe paths with small heading changes without requiring the use of post-processing methods. Extensive experiments and comparisons in challenging 3D indoor simulation environments, complemented by tests in real-world outdoor environments, are used to evaluate and validate the FS-Planner. The results show consistent improvements in computation time, exploration efficiency, safety, and smoothness in a geometric sense compared with baseline heuristic planners, while maintaining sub-optimality within acceptable bounds. Finally, the proposed EDF-based cost formulation is orthogonal to the underlying search method and can be incorporated into other planning paradigms.</description>

      <title>Semi-Tensor-Product Based Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-tensor product of vectors generalizes the conventional inner product, enabling algebraic operations between vectors of different dimensions. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a domain-based convolutional product and integrate it with the STP to formulate a padding-free convolutional operation. This new operation inherently avoids zero or other artificial padding, thereby eliminating redundant information and boundary artifacts commonly present in conventional convolutional neural networks. Based on this operation, we further develop an STP-based CNN framework that extends convolutional computation to irregular and cross-dimensional data domains. Applications to image processing and third-order signal identification demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in handling irregular, incomplete, and high-dimensional data without the distortions caused by padding.</description>

      <title>Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have become dominant computational workloads across cloud and edge platforms, but their rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the current technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures, domain-specific accelerators (TPUs, NPUs), FPGA-based designs, ASIC inference engines, and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs, alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the survey using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas such as systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- pointing to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.</description>

      <title>Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Field over B\'ezier's Curves Applied to Rovers Path Planning and Path Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a guidance algorithm for solving the problem of following parametric paths, as well as a curvature-varying speed setpoint for land-based car-type wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). The guidance algorithm relies on Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Fields SF-GVF. This novel GVF approach expands the desired robot path and the Guiding vector field to a higher dimensional space, in which an angular control function can be found to ensure global asymptotic convergence to the desired parametric path while avoiding field singularities. In SF-GVF, paths should follow a parametric definition. This feature makes using Bezier's curves attractive to define the robot's desired patch. The curvature-varying speed setpoint, combined with the guidance algorithm, eases the convergence to the path when physical restrictions exist, such as minimal turning radius or maximal lateral acceleration. We provide theoretical results, simulations, and outdoor experiments using a WMR platform assembled with off-the-shelf components.</description>

      <title>Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Model-Predictive Control of a Soft Continuum Robot Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Based on Cosserat Rod Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot reconstruct the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.</description>
