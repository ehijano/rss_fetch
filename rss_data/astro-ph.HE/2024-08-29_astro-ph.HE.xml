      <title>Constraints on the parameter space in dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties using the relativistic mean-field theory. By incorporating the dark matter model, we explore how dark matter parameters, specifically dark matter mass and Fermi momentum, influence nuclear saturation properties, the equation of state, and the mass-radius relationship of neutron stars. We also examine the universal relation between dimensionless tidal deformability and compactness in the presence of dark matter. Our results show that the inclusion of dark matter significantly alters nuclear saturation properties, leading to higher incompressibility and symmetry energy values. Notably, higher dark matter Fermi momenta and masses result in more compact neutron star configurations with reduced radii and lower maximum masses, highlighting a complex interplay between dark matter and nuclear matter. Deviations from the universal relation are observed with dark matter inclusion, particularly for neutron stars with lower compactness. By leveraging observational data from PSR J0740+6620, GW170817, and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) measurements of PSR J0030+0451, we derive stringent constraints on dark matter parameter space within neutron stars, emphasizing the necessity of integrating multimodal observations to delineate the properties of dark matter along with neutron stars. Our findings underscore the importance of considering dark matter effects in neutron star modeling and suggest potential refinements for current theoretical frameworks to accurately predict neutron star properties under various astrophysical conditions.</description>

      <title>Collapsar disk outflows II: Heavy element production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nucleosynthesis in the sub-relativistic outflows from black hole (BH) accretion disks formed in failed supernovae from rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. These disks reach the neutrino-cooled regime during a portion of their evolution, undergoing significant neutronization and thus having the potential to support the $r$-process. Here, we analyze the formation of heavy elements in the ejecta from global, axisymmetric, long-term, viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these systems that include neutrino emission and absorption, Newtonian self-gravity, a pseudo-Newtonian potential for the BH gravity, and a 19-isotope nuclear network. Tracer particles are used for post-processing with a larger network. In addition to analyzing models from a previous paper, we present new models in which we modify the rotation profile of the progenitor star, to maximize neutrino reprocessing of circularized mass shells. All of our models produce several $M_\odot$ of O, followed by about a solar mass of C, Ne, and Ni, with other alpha elements produced in smaller quantities. Only one of our models, with the lowest viscosity, yields significant amounts of first $r$-process peak elements, with negligible yields at higher nuclear masses. The rest of the set, including models with a modified rotation profile, produces very small or negligible quantities of elements beyond the iron group. Models that produce the heaviest elements (up to $A\sim200$) do so along the proton-rich side of the valley of stability at high entropy ($s/k_B\sim80$), pointing to the $rp$-process as a mechanism that operates in collapsars. The absence of neutron-rich ejecta proves to be insensitive to changes in the rotation profile of the star, suggesting that heavy $r$-process elements are difficult to produce in collapsars if no large-scale poloidal magnetic field is present in the disk to drive outflows during neutronization.</description>

      <title>Disk mass after a binary neutron star merger as a constraining parameter for short Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The coincident detection of GW170817 and GRB170817A marked a milestone for the connection between binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). These mergers can lead to the formation of a black hole surrounded by a disk and the generation of a powerful jet. It spends energy to break free from the merger ejecta, and then a portion of it, is dissipated to produce observable emissions. Aims. Our primary goal is to enhance our comprehension of BNS mergers by constraining the disk mass for a selection of sGRBs, utilizing isotropic gamma-ray luminosity and corresponding emission times as key indicators. Methods. In this study, we leverage data from GW170817 to estimate the disk mass surrounding the BNS merger remnant and subsequently infer the accretion-to-jet efficiency. Then statistically examine other sGRBs observations to estimate the possibility of being induced by BNS mergers Results. Our findings suggest that, when employing similar physical parameters as in the sole observed BNS-powered GRB event, GRB170817A, a substantial fraction of sGRBs necessitate an unrealistically massive disk remnant. Conclusions. This observation raises the possibility that either a different mechanis</description>

      <title>Constraining Dust Formation in the Superluminous Supernova 2017gci with JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of the Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) 2017gci taken over 2000 rest-frame days after the supernova (SN) exploded, which represent the latest phase images taken of any known SLSN. We find that archival \WISE detections of SN\,2017gci taken 70 to 200 days after explosion are most likely explained by an IR dust echo from a $\sim 3 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ shell of pre-existing dust, as opposed to freshly-formed dust. New JWST observations reveal IR emission in the field of SN\,2017gci, which we determine is most likely dominated by the host galaxy of the SN, based on the expected flux of the galaxy and the measurable separation between said emission and the location of the SN. Based on models for IR emission of carbonate dust, we place a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $0.83$ M$_\odot$ of dust formed in SN\,2017gci, with a lowest $1\sigma$ limit of $0.44$ M$_\odot$. Infrared (IR) detections of other SLSNe have suggested that SLSNe could be among the most efficient dust producers in the universe. Our results suggest that SLSNe do not necessarily form more dust than other types of SNe, but instead might have a more accelerated dust formation process. More IR observations of a larger sample of SLSNe will be required to determine how efficient dust production is in SLSNe.</description>

      <title>Plasma diagnostics of supernova remnant 3C 400.2 by Suzaku observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a result of plasma diagnostics of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 400.2, which has been reported to have a recombining plasma (RP) by previous studies. For careful background estimation, we simultaneously fitted spectra extracted from the SNR and background regions and evaluated the SNR emission contaminating the background-region spectrum as well as the background emission in the source-region spectrum. The SNR emission is explained by the collisional ionization equilibrium plasma originating from the interstellar medium and the ionizing plasma originating from the ejecta, in contrast to the previous studies. In addition, we found an unidentified X-ray source near the SNR, Suzaku J1937.4+1718, which is accompanied by an emission line at ~4.4~keV with the 2.8$\sigma$ confidence level. Since there is no striking atomic line at the energy in the rest frame, Suzaku J1937.4+1718 can be an extragalactic object with a redshifted Fe line.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration, escape and non-thermal emission from core-collapse supernovae inside non-identical wind-blown bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the core-collapse scenario, the supernova remnants evolve inside the complex wind-blown bubbles, structured by massive progenitors during their lifetime. Therefore, particle acceleration and the emissions from these SNRs can carry the fingerprints of the evolutionary sequences of the progenitor stars.
  We time-dependently investigate the impact of the ambient environment of core-collapse SNRs on particle spectra and the emissions. We use the RATPaC code to model the particle acceleration at the SNRs with progenitors having ZAMS masses of 20 Msol and 60 Msol. We have constructed the pre-supernova circumstellar medium by solving the hydrodynamic equations for the lifetime of the progenitor stars. Then, the transport equation for cosmic rays, and magnetic turbulence in test-particle approximation along with the induction equation for the evolution of large-scale magnetic field have been solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations for the expansion of SNRs inside the pre-supernova CSM.
  The structure of the wind bubbles along with the magnetic field and the scattering turbulence regulate the spectra of accelerated particles for both SNRs. For the 60 Msol progenitor the spectral index reaches 2.4 even below 10 GeV during the propagation of the SNR shock inside the hot shocked wind. In contrast, we have not observed persistent soft spectra at earlier evolutionary stages of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor, for which the spectral index becomes 2.2 only for a brief period. Later, the spectra become soft above ~10 GeV for both SNRs, as weak driving of turbulence permits the escape of high-energy particles from the remnants. The emission morphology of the SNRs strongly depends on the type of progenitors. For instance, the radio morphology of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor is centre-filled at early stages whereas that for the more massive progenitor is shell-like.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of highly inclined extensive air showers in GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock breakout emission from binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is among the first observable signals in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including neutron star (NS) mergers, and it can be the dominant component in low-luminosity short gamma-ray bursts (llsGRBs), as exemplified by GRB 170817A. In this work, we investigate the cocoon shock breakout emission in NS mergers and how its signal depends on the outermost layers of the ejecta profile, which we derive from general relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We study the formation of the cocoon as a consequence of a relativistic jet propagating through the ejecta. To explore the influence of the outermost layers of the ejecta on the breakout emission, we explore cases where the ejecta has a sharp cutoff or an extended smooth tail. We find that the shock breakout emission is strongly influenced by the shape of the ejecta outer layers, with extended tails yielding results consistent with the observed properties of GRB 170817A, whereas sharp cutoffs overestimate the radiated energy. Using a Bayesian analysis, we estimate the best fit parameters of the central engine, considering both accreting black hole and magnetized neutron star scenarios. Our findings indicate a slight preference for the scenarios where the engine is a black hole. Our work probes the nature of neutron star mergers and highlights the importance of the shape of the ejecta profile in modeling early electromagnetic counterparts to these mergers.</description>

      <title>A temperature scale of $1\sim2$ eV in the mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs of type DA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs (WDs) is one of their defining characteristics, largely derived from electron degeneracy pressure. We present a model-independent study of the observed mass-radius relationship in WD binaries of \cite{Parsons_2017}, listing data over a broad temperature range up to about 60,000 K (5 eV). The data show an appreciable temperature sensitivity with pronounced intrinsic scatter (beyond measurement uncertainty) for the canonical He-models with proton-to-neutron ratio 1:1. We characterize temperature sensitivity by a temperature scale $T_0$ in model-agnostic power-law relations with temperature normalized radius. For low-mass WDs, the results identify a remarkably modest $T_0 = 1 \sim 2 $ eV. We comment on a potential interpretation for atmospheres insulating super-Eddington temperature cores from the sub-Eddington photospheres of low-mass WDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that dark matter can illuminate planetary skies via ultraviolet airglow. Dark matter annihilation products can excite molecular hydrogen, which then deexcites to produce ultraviolet emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. We search for this new effect by analyzing nightside ultraviolet radiation data from Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons flybys of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Our findings set new constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section down to about $10^{-40}~$cm$^2$. We highlight that future ultraviolet airglow measurements of Solar System planets or other worlds provide a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Fast Soft X-ray Wind in M82 from XMM-RGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starburst wind models predict that metals and energy are primarily carried out of the disk by hot gas ($T &gt; 10^{6}$ K), but the low energy resolution of X-ray CCD observations results in large uncertainties on the mass and energy loading. Here, we present evidence for a fast soft X-ray wind from the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 using deep archival observations from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer on XMM-Newton. After characterizing the complex line-spread function for the spatially extended outflow ($\approx 4'$), we perform emission-line fitting to measure the velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{v}}$, from OVIII (0.65, 0.77 keV), NeX (1.02 keV), and MgXII (1.47 keV). For the $T \approx 3 \times 10^{6}$ K gas, OVIII yields a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\text{v}} = 1160^{+100}_{-90}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a wind speed that is significantly above the escape velocity ($v_{\text{esc}} \lesssim 450$ km s$^{-1}$). NeX ($\sigma_{\text{v}} = 550^{+130}_{-150}$ km s$^{-1}$) and MgXII ($\sigma_{\text{v}} &lt; 370$ km s$^{-1}$) show less velocity broadening than OVIII, hinting at a lower wind speed or smaller opening angle on the more compact spatial scales traced by the $T \approx (0.6 - 1) \times 10^{7}$ K gas. Alternatively, these higher energy emission lines may be dominated by shock-heated gas in the interstellar medium. Future synthesis of these measurements with Performance Verification observations of the $E = 2 - 12$ keV wind in M82 from the Resolve microcalorimeter on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will inform the phase structure and energy budget of the hot starburst wind.</description>

      <title>Stellar modeling via the Tolman IV solution: The cases of the massive pulsar J0740+6620 and the HESS J1731-347 compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model compact objects of known stellar mass and radius made of isotropic matter within Einstein's gravity. The interior solution describing hydrostatic equilibrium we are using throughout the manuscript corresponds to the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. The three free parameters of the solutions are determined imposing the matching conditions for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that contrary to the Kohler Chao solution, the Tolman IV solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. except for the relativistic adiabatic index that diverges at the surface of the stars. The divergence of the index $\Gamma$ may be resolved including a thin crust assuming a polytropic equation-of-state, which is precisely the case seen in studies of neutron stars. To the best of our knowledge, we model here for the first time the recently discovered massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and the strangely light HESS compact object via the Tolman IV solution. The present work may be of interest to model builders as well as a useful reference for future research.</description>

      <title>A 2.9-hour periodic radio transient with an optical counterpart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a long-period radio transient (GLEAM-X J0704-37) discovered to have an optical counterpart, consistent with a cool main sequence star of spectral type M3. The radio pulsations occur at the longest period yet found, 2.9 hours, and were discovered in archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). High time resolution observations from MeerKAT show that pulsations from the source display complex microstructure and high linear polarisation, suggesting a pulsar-like emission mechanism occurring due to strong, ordered magnetic fields. The timing residuals, measured over more than a decade, show tentative evidence of a ~6-yr modulation. The high Galactic latitude of the system and the M-dwarf star excludes the magnetar interpretation, suggesting a more likely M-dwarf / white dwarf binary scenario for this system.</description>

      <title>What does perturbative QCD really have to say about neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The implications of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While pQCD calculations above baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\sim2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), such constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in constraints that are orthogonal to current or expected astrophysical bounds. In the most constraining scenario, pQCD considerations favor low values of the squared speed sound $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for the most massive neutron stars, but leave predictions of the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\sim0.5$, or if pQCD breaks down below $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large pQCD uncertainties preclude any meaningful bounds on the neutron star EOS at the moment. Interestingly, if pQCD predictions for the pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV are refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS in combination with the existence of two-solar-mass pulsars would indicate the presence of color superconductivity beyond neutron star densities. We point out that two-solar-mass pulsars place robust upper bounds on this non-perturbative effect and require the pairing gap to be less than $\Delta_\mathrm{CFL}\lesssim500$ MeV at $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Properties of magnetic turbulence in GRB afterglows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model-independent way to characterise properties of the magnetic-field turbulence in the emitting regions of Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows. Our only assumption is that afterglows' synchrotron radiation is efficient. It turns out that the gyroradius of plasma particles must be smaller (with a good margin) than the correlation length of the magnetic-field fluctuations. Such turbulence is essentially non-linear and therefore must be produced by some kind of MHD instability, likely acting on top of kinetic Weibel instability. We also find that the emitting particles are loosely confined to local magnetic-field structures and diffusion allows them to sample the entire distribution of local magnetization values. This means that one-zone approach to modelling the afterglow spectra is still valid despite the non-linear nature of the magnetic turbulence. However, the non-linear turbulence may (and likely will) change the synchrotron spectrum of individual electrons.</description>

      <title>Testing unified models for the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos: Multimessenger approaches with x-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unified models of astrophysical sources to account for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and high-energy cosmic neutrinos with energies greater than 100 TeV have been discussed. Based on model-independent arguments, we argue that if the photomeson production is the dominant mechanism, the most probable candidate sources are x-ray transient objects, allowing for the semi-transparency for the photomeson production. We develop a generic model of high-energy neutrino emitters accompanied by x-ray emission, and present how multimessenger observations can place significant constraints on the source parameters that characterize the common sources of neutrinos and UHECRs, such as the cosmic-ray loading factor. The requirements of UHECR acceleration, escape, and energetics further constrain the magnetic field and the bulk Lorentz factor of the sources. The resulting bounds provide diagnoses of the unified models, which demonstrates the importance of current and future x-ray facilities such as MAXI and Einstein Probe.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability in the Symbiotic Binary RT Cru: Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Signatures of Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes with Circumbinary Disks in LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that stellar-mass binary black holes with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead stellar-mass binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>AstroSat and Insight-HXMT observations of the long-period X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the timing and spectral studies of the accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54 using astrosat and hxmt observations taken in 2016 and 2020 respectively. X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions. The astrosat discovered a significant periodic signal at $\sim 5619$ s in 2016 and hxmt found a pulsation period at $\sim 5291$ s in 2020. A comparison of its spin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently undergoing a spin-up episode after attaining to its slow pulsations of ~5750~s around 2015 from its prolonged spin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be at $\sim1.2\times10^{-13}$ Hz~s$^{-1}$. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-60\kev could be explained with a high energy cutoff power-law continuum model, no evident line features are found with astrosat. The application of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase averaged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveal a hotter source photon region near the pulsar with an emission size extending to $\sim 2-2.8$~km. Using the quasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and the possibility of strong magnetic field of the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Efficient gravitational-wave model for fully-precessing and moderately-eccentric, compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational-wave detectors, especially the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be sensitive to black hole binaries formed in astrophysical environments that promote large eccentricities and spin-induced orbital precession. Approximate models of gravitational waves that include both effects have only recently begun to be developed. The Efficient Fully Precessing Eccentric (EFPE) family is one such model, covering the inspiral stage with small-eccentricity-expanded gravitational-wave amplitudes accurate for initial time eccentricities $e &lt; 0.3$ at 4 years before reaching an orbital frequency of 1 Hz. In this work, we extend this model to cover a larger range of initial eccentricities. The new EFPE for moderate eccentricities (EFPE_ME) model is able to accurately represent the leading-order gravitational-wave amplitudes to $e \leq 0.8$. Comparing the EFPE and the EFPE_ME models in the LISA band, however, reveals that there is no significant difference when the eccentricity at 4 years before merger, $e_0$, is less than or equal to 0.5, as radiation reaction circularizes supermassive black hole binaries too quickly. This suggests that the EFPE model may have a larger regime of validity in eccentricity space than previously thought, making it suitable for some inspiral parameter estimation with LISA data. On the other hand, for systems with $e_0 &gt; 0.5$, the deviations between the models are significant, particularly for binaries with total masses below $10^5\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This suggests that the EFPE_ME model will be crucial to avoid systematic bias in parameter estimation with LISA in the future, once this model has been hybridized to include the merger and ringdown and the computation of the amplitudes is optimized.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and wander, ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are swept up into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short ($\ll$ yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at $\lesssim 10$ au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Resolved Ionization Mapping of Broad Line Region. I. Insights into Diverse Geometry and Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the red-shifted and blue-shifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.</description>
