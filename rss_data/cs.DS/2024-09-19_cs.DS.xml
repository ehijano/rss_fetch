      <title>Canonical forms for matrix tuples in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left-right and conjugation actions on matrix tuples have received considerable attention in theoretical computer science due to their connections with polynomial identity testing, group isomorphism, and tensor isomorphism. In this paper, we present polynomial-time algorithms for computing canonical forms of matrix tuples over a finite field under these actions. Our algorithm builds upon new structural insights for matrix tuples, which can be viewed as a generalization of Schur's lemma for irreducible representations to general representations.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Networks for Constrained Multicuts in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a \emph{multicut-mimicking network} for a hypergraph over terminals $T$ with a parameter $c$. It is a hypergraph preserving the minimum multicut values of any set of pairs over $T$ where the value is at most $c$. This is a new variant of the multicut-mimicking network of a graph in [Wahlstr{\"o}m ICALP'20], which introduces a parameter $c$ and extends it to handle hypergraphs. Additionally, it is a natural extension of the \emph{connectivity-$c$ mimicking network} introduced by [Chalermsook et al. SODA'21] and [Jiang et al. ESA'22] that is a (hyper)graph preserving the minimum cut values between two subsets of terminals where the value is at most $c$. We propose an algorithm for a hypergraph that returns a multicut-mimicking network over terminals $T$ with a parameter $c$ having $|T|c^{O(r\log c)}$ hyperedges in $p^{1+o(1)}+|T|(c^r\log n)^{\tilde{O}(rc)}m$ time, where $p$ and $r$ are the total size and the rank, respectively, of the hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Hardness of Online Minimization and Maximization Problems with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the work of Berg, Boyar, Favrholdt, and Larsen, who developed a complexity theory for online minimization problems with and without predictions (arXiv:2406.18265), we consider online maximization problems with and without predictions. We define complexity classes that capture the hardness of Online Bounded Degree Independent Set, prove several structural properties of the complexity classes, establish a strict hierarchy, and show multiple membership, hardness, and completeness results.
  Further, we establish reductions that relate the hardness of Online Bounded Degree Vertex Cover and Online Bounded Degree Independent Set, while respecting that the hardness of minimization problems is measured differently than the hardness of maximization problems. In particular, we show that there exist good algorithms for Online Bounded Degree Independent Set if and only if there exist good algorithms for Online Bounded Degree Vertex Cover. Since these reductions relate the hardness of complete problems for the complexity classes for maximization problems and complete problems for the complexity classes for minimization problems, their existence provides a connection between the complexity classes for minimization and maximization problems. This connection gives similar reductions relating the hardness of various other pairs of minimization and maximization problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Channel Testing in Average-Case Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of testing properties of quantum channels. First, we show that testing identity to any channel $\mathcal N: \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{in}} \times d_{\mathrm{in}}} \to \mathbb C^{d_{\mathrm{out}} \times d_{\mathrm{out}}}$ in diamond norm distance requires $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{in}} / \varepsilon})$ queries, even in the strongest algorithmic model that admits ancillae, coherence, and adaptivity. This is due to the worst-case nature of the distance induced by the diamond norm.
  Motivated by this limitation and other theoretical and practical applications, we introduce an average-case analogue of the diamond norm, which we call the average-case imitation diamond (ACID) norm. In the weakest algorithmic model without ancillae, coherence, or adaptivity, we prove that testing identity to certain types of channels in ACID distance can be done with complexity independent of the dimensions of the channel, while for other types of channels the complexity depends on both the input and output dimensions. Building on previous work, we also show that identity to any fixed channel can be tested with $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in ACID distance and $\tilde O(d_{\mathrm{in}}^2 d_{\mathrm{out}}^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries in diamond distance in this model. Finally, we prove tight bounds on the complexity of channel tomography in ACID distance.</description>

      <title>Unrolled denoising networks provably learn optimal Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of Bayesian inference centers around the design of estimators for inverse problems which are optimal assuming the data comes from a known prior. But what do these optimality guarantees mean if the prior is unknown? In recent years, algorithm unrolling has emerged as deep learning's answer to this age-old question: design a neural network whose layers can in principle simulate iterations of inference algorithms and train on data generated by the unknown prior. Despite its empirical success, however, it has remained unclear whether this method can provably recover the performance of its optimal, prior-aware counterparts.
  In this work, we prove the first rigorous learning guarantees for neural networks based on unrolling approximate message passing (AMP). For compressed sensing, we prove that when trained on data drawn from a product prior, the layers of the network approximately converge to the same denoisers used in Bayes AMP. We also provide extensive numerical experiments for compressed sensing and rank-one matrix estimation demonstrating the advantages of our unrolled architecture - in addition to being able to obliviously adapt to general priors, it exhibits improvements over Bayes AMP in more general settings of low dimensions, non-Gaussian designs, and non-product priors.</description>

      <title>Beyond Value Iteration for Parity Games: Strategy Iteration with Universal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.
  As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n \log d)$ respectively per iteration.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Patterns in Temporal Graphs Resulting from Encounters in a Corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study temporal graphs arising from mobility models, where vertices correspond to agents moving in space and edges appear each time two agents meet. We propose a rather natural one-dimensional model.
  If each pair of agents meets exactly once, we get a simple temporal clique where the edges are ordered according to meeting times. In order to characterize which temporal cliques can be obtained as such `mobility graphs', we introduce the notion of forbidden patterns in temporal graphs. Furthermore, using a classical result in combinatorics, we count the number of such mobility cliques for a given number of agents, and show that not every temporal clique resulting from the 1D model can be realized with agents moving with different constant speeds. For the analogous circular problem, where agents are moving along a circle, we provide a characterization via circular forbidden patterns.
  Our characterization in terms of forbidden patterns can be extended to the case where each edge appears at most once. We also study the problem where pairs of agents are allowed to cross each other several times, using an approach from automata theory. We observe that in this case, there is no finite set of forbidden patterns that characterize such temporal graphs and nevertheless give a linear-time algorithm to recognize temporal graphs arising from this model.</description>

      <title>Similarity analysis of DNA sequences through local distribution of nucleotides in strategic neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14994v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new alignment-free algorithm by constructing a compact vector representation on $\mathbb{R}^{24}$ of a DNA sequence of arbitrary length. Each component of this vector is obtained from a representative sequence, the elements of which are the values realized by a function $\Gamma$. This function $\Gamma$ acts on neighborhoods of arbitrary radius that are located at strategic positions within the DNA sequence and carries complete information about the local distribution of frequencies of the nucleotides as a consequence of the uniqueness of prime factorization of integer. The algorithm exhibits linear time complexity and turns out to consume significantly small memory. The two natural parameters characterizing the radius and location of the neighbourhoods are fixed by comparing the phylogenetic tree with the benchmark for full genome sequences of fish mtDNA datasets. Using these fitting parameters, the method is applied to analyze a number of genome sequences from benchmark and other standard datasets. Our algorithm proves to be computationally efficient compared to other well known algorithms when applied on simulated dataset.</description>

      <title>High Probability Latency Sequential Change Detection over an Unknown Finite Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is studied, in which the goal is to minimize a delay threshold (latency), under constraints on the probability of false alarm and the probability that the latency is exceeded. In addition, the horizon is not known to the change detector. A variant of the cumulative sum (CuSum) test with a threshold that increasing logarithmically with time is proposed as a candidate solution to the problem. An information-theoretic lower bound on the minimum value of the latency under the constraints is then developed. This lower bound is used to establish certain asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed test in terms of the horizon and the false alarm probability. Some experimental results are given to illustrate the performance of the test.</description>

      <title>RCM++:Reverse Cuthill-McKee ordering with Bi-Criteria Node Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) algorithm is a graph-based method for reordering sparse matrices, renowned for its effectiveness in minimizing matrix bandwidth and profile. This reordering enhances the efficiency of matrix operations, making RCM pivotal among reordering algorithms. In the context of executing the RCM algorithm, it is often necessary to select a starting node from the graph representation of the matrix. This selection allows the execution of BFS (Breadth-First Search) to construct the level structure. The choice of this starting node significantly impacts the algorithm's performance, necessitating a heuristic approach to identify an optimal starting node, commonly referred to as the RCM starting node problem. Techniques such as the minimum degree method and George-Liu (GL) algorithm are popular solutions.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm addressing the RCM starting node problem by considering both the eccentricity and the width of the node during the run. Integrating this algorithm with the RCM algorithm, we introduce RCM++. Experimental results demonstrate that RCM++ outperforms existing RCM methods in major software libraries, achieving higher quality results with comparable computation time. This advancement fosters the further application and development of the RCM algorithm.The code related to this research has been made available at https://github.com/SStan1/RCM\_PP.git.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Geodesic Spanners using Steiner Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric $t$-spanner $\mathcal{G}$ on a set $S$ of $n$ point sites in a metric space $P$ is a subgraph of the complete graph on $S$ such that for every pair of sites $p,q$ the distance in $\mathcal{G}$ is a most $t$ times the distance $d(p,q)$ in $P$. We call a connection between two sites a \emph{link}. In some settings, such as when $P$ is a simple polygon with $m$ vertices and a link is a shortest path in $P$, links can consist of $\Theta (m)$ segments and thus have non-constant complexity. The spanner complexity is a measure of how compact a spanner is, which is equal to the sum of the complexities of all links in the spanner. In this paper, we study what happens if we are allowed to introduce $k$ Steiner points to reduce the spanner complexity. We study such Steiner spanners in simple polygons, polygonal domains, and edge-weighted trees. We show that Steiner points have only limited utility. For a spanner that uses $k$ Steiner points, we provide an $\Omega(mn^{1/(t+1)}/k^{1/(t+1)})$ lower bound on the worst-case complexity of any $(t-\varepsilon)$-spanner, for any constant $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ and integer constant $t \geq 2$. Additionally, we show NP-hardness for the problem of deciding whether a set of sites in a polygonal domain admits a $3$-spanner with a given maximum complexity using $k$ Steiner points. On the positive side, for trees we show how to build a $2t$-spanner that uses $k$ Steiner points of complexity $O(mn^{1/t}/k^{1/t} + n \log (n/k))$, for any integer $t \geq 1$. We generalize this to forests, and use it to obtain a $2\sqrt{2}t$-spanner in a simple polygon with complexity $O(mn^{1/t}(\log k)^{1+1/t}/k^{1/t} + n\log^2 n)$. When a link can be any path between two sites, we show how to improve the spanning ratio to $(2k+\varepsilon)$, for any constant $\varepsilon \in (0,2k)$, and how to build a $6t$-spanner in a polygonal domain with the same complexity.</description>
