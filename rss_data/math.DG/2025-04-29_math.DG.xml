      <title>Weakly Einstein curvature tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify weakly Einstein algebraic curvature tensors in an oriented Euclidean 4-space, defined by requiring that the three-index contraction of the curvature tensor against itself be a multiple of the inner product. This algebraic formulation parallels the geometric notion of weakly Einstein Riemannian four-manifolds, which include conformally flat scalar-flat, and Einstein manifolds. Our main result provides a complete classification of non-Einstein weakly Einstein curvature tensors in dimension four, naturally dividing them into three disjoint five-dimensional families of algebraic types. These types are explicitly constructed using bases that simultaneously diagonalize both the Einstein tensor and the (anti)self-dual Weyl tensors, which consequently proves that such simultaneous diagonalizability follows from the weakly Einstein property. We also describe how the known geometric examples that are neither Einstein, nor conformally flat scalar-flat (namely, the EPS space and certain K\"ahler surfaces) fit within our classification framework.</description>

      <title>A characterization of proper actions with bornology and coarse geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1961, Palais showed that every smooth proper Lie group action on a smooth manifold admits a compatible Riemannian metric on the manifold such that the action becomes isometric. In 2006, Yoshino studied a continuous proper action of a locally compact Hausdorff group on a locally compact Hausdorff space, and showed that the space carries a compatible uniform structure making the action equi continuous in an appropriate setting. In this paper, we focus on bornological proper actions on bornological spaces and prove that the space admits a compatible coarse structure such that the action becomes equi controlled.</description>

      <title>A lower bound of the energy functional of a class of vector fields and a characterization of the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, orientable, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, $n\geq2$, and let $F$ be the energy functional acting on the space $\Xi (M)$ of $C^{\infty }$ vector fields of $M$,
  \[ F(X):=\frac{\int_{M}\left\Vert \nabla X\right\Vert ^{2}dM}{\int_{M}\left\Vert X\right\Vert ^{2}dM}, X\in \Xi (M)\backslash\{0\}. % \]
  Let $G\in\operatorname*{Iso}\left(M\right)$ be a compact Lie subgroup of the isometry group of $M$ acting with cohomogeneity $1$ on $M$. Assume that any isotropy subgroup of $G$ is non trivial and acts with no fixed points on the tangent spaces of $M$, except at the null vectors. We prove in this note that under these hypothesis, if the Ricci curvature $\operatorname*{Ric}\nolimits_{M}$
  of $M$ has the lower bound $\operatorname*{Ric}\nolimits_{M}\geq(n-1)k^{2}$, then $\operatorname*{F(X)}\geq(n-1)k^{2}$, for any $G$-invariant vector field $X\in \Xi (M)\backslash\{0\}$, and the equality occurs if and only if $M$ is isometric to the n-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n}_k$ of constant sectional curvature $k^{2}$. In this case $X$ is an infimum of $F$ on $\Xi (\mathbb{S}^{n}_k).$</description>

      <title>Hausdorff measure bounds for density-$Q$ flat singularities of minimizing integral currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the set of flat singular points of locally highest density of area-minimizing integral currents of dimension $m$ and general codimension in a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$ has locally finite $(m-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. In fact, the set of such flat singular points can be split into a union of two sets, one of which we show is locally $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-negligible, while for the other we obtain local $(m-2)$-dimensional Minkowski content bounds.</description>

      <title>Invariance of subbundles and nonholonomic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. Motivated by this, differential conditions are considered for invariant affine subbundles as they arise in the comparison of nonholonomic and constrained variational mechanics. First of all, the formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Second, iterative formulae are provided that permit the determination of the largest invariant affine subbundle invariant under an affine vector field. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Hyperkaehler Marriage of the two sphere with the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eguchi-Hanson metric is a natural metric on the total space of the cotangent bundle $T^*\mathbb{CP}(1)$ of the complex projective line $\mathbb{CP}(1) \simeq \mathbb{S}^2$, which extends the Fubini-Study metric of $\mathbb{CP}(1)$. By virtue of the Mostow decomposition theorem, $T^*\mathbb{CP}(1)$ is isomorphic, as $SU(2)$-equivariant fiber bundle over $\mathbb{CP}(1)$, to a complex (co-)adjoint orbit of $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$. In fact, this complex (co-)adjoint orbit is fibered over $\mathbb{CP}(1)\simeq \mathbb{S}^2$ with each fiber isomorphic to the hyperbolic disc $\mathbb{H}^2$. In this paper, we are interested in the complex structure inherited on the hyperbolic disc $\mathbb{H}^2$ by the hyperk\"ahler extension of the $2$-sphere. Contrary to what is generally believed, we show that it differs from the natural complex structure of $\mathbb{H}^2\subset \mathbb{C}$ inherited from its embedding in $\mathbb{C}$. In other words, the embedding of $\mathbb{H}^2$ with its Hermitian-symmetric structure into the hyperk\"ahler manifold $T^*\mathbb{CP}(1)$ is not holomorphic.</description>

      <title>Fourier and Helgason Fourier transforms for Vector Bundle-valued Differential Forms on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the perspective of the functional equation  satised by the classical Fourier transform to derive the Helgason  Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,V[\chi]):f\longmapsto \widehat{f}:G/K\times G/P\mapsto V[\chi]:(x,b)\longmapsto\widehat{f}(x,b)$ (for $W-$valued differential forms $f\in \Omega^{l}(G/K,W)$) as the $G-$ invariant vector bundle-valued differential form $\widehat{f}$ on the product  space $G/K\times G/P$ whose image under the vector bundle-valued Poisson transform is the fibre convolution-integral $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}* f$ on $G/K,$ where $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}$ is the $W-$valued $\tau-$spherical $l-$form on $G/K.$ Explicitly, we prove that $$\widehat{f}_{l,k,\lambda}(x,b)=({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\tau,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x),$$ where $b\in G/P$ is a consequence of the boundary map $\beta^{V}(\lambda)$ and ${\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}$ is the vector bundle-valued Harish-Chandra $c-$function. The Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,W)$ $:f\mapsto f^{\triangle}$ $:(b,x)\longmapsto f^{\triangle}(b,x)$ is then established to be explicitly given as $f^{\triangle}_{l,k,\lambda}(b,x)=$ $$\int_{G/P}\phi_{k,l}\wedge\pi^{*}_{P}(({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\tau,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x)).$$</description>

      <title>Quantitative cyclicity, stability, and geometric analysis in weighted Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new quantitative measures for cyclicity in radially weighted Besov spaces, including the Drury-Arveson space, by defining cyclicity indices based on potential theory and capacity. Extensions to non-commutative settings are developed, yielding analogues of cyclicity in free function spaces. We also study the stability of cyclic functions under perturbations of both the functions and the underlying weight, and we establish geometric criteria linking the structure of zero sets on the boundary to the failure or persistence of cyclicity. These results provide novel invariants and conditions that characterize cyclicity and the structure of multiplier invariant subspaces in a variety of function spaces.</description>

      <title>On The Smoothness of Cayley Conditions in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poncelet's porism concerns the existence of polygons simultaneously inscribed in one conic and circumscribed about another. Cayley's theorem provides algebraic conditions for such polygons to exist, expressed through the coefficients of a certain determinantal expansion. In this paper, we focus on the case of triangles and establish three main results concerning the geometry of the Cayley condition. First, we derive an explicit algebraic equation that defines the Cayley set - the locus of conic pairs admitting Poncelet triangles - and prove that this set is a constructible set in the space of conic pairs. Second, we demonstrate that the Cayley set is a smooth manifold by showing it is an open subset of the total space of a smooth trivial fiber bundle with fibers isomorphic to a quadric hypersurface. Finally, we formulate the Poncelet correspondence as a principal bundle whose fibers are complex tori (elliptic curves), proving that all elliptic curves arising from conic pairs in the Cayley set are isomorphic. This differential-geometric approach not only clarifies the structure of the solution space for Poncelet triangles.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>A topological quantum field theory for $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. Using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, we derive the action of the theory in purely geometric terms, which coincides with prior results in the literature. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction while making the BRST symmetry explicit and providing a natural framework for classical observables. We also show that the Batalin-Vilkovisky action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.</description>

      <title>Degenerate quarternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equations in weighted energy classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider degenerate quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equations in weighted energy class $\mathcal{E}_{\chi}(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is a quarternionic domain in $\mathbb{H}^n$ and $\chi$ is a weight function which satisfies some natural conditions. Firstly we prove that the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere operator is well-defined for functions in $\mathcal{E}_{\chi}(\Omega)$, in particular $\mathcal{E}_p(\Omega),p&gt;0$.
  Secondly, we prove that fine property holds in the Cegrell type class $\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$. As an application, we prove a mass concentration theorem for the quarternionic plurisubharmonic envelope.
  In the study of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, characterization of finite energy range of complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator was a central problem which aroused the interest of experts in the subject. As a quaternionic analogue, we prove a theorem which explicitly characterizes the finite energy range of \emph{quaternionic} Monge-Amp\`ere operator in the end.</description>

      <title>Morse homology for a class of elliptic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a notion of non-degeneracy which allows to develop Morse theory is generically satisfied for a large class of $C^2$-functionals defined on Banach spaces. The main element of novelty with respect to the previous work of the first and third author is that we do not assume the splitting induced by the second differential at a critical point to persist in a neighborhood, provided one can give precise estimates on how much persistence fails. This allows us to enlarge significantly the class of elliptic pde's for which non-degeneracy holds and Morse homology can be defined. A concrete example is given by equations involving the $p$-Laplacian, $p\leq n$. As a byproduct, we provide a criterion of independent interest to check whether critical points are non-degenerate in the sense above, and give an abstract construction of Morse homology in a Banach setting for functionals satisfying the Cerami condition.</description>

      <title>Tian's theorem for Grassmannian embeddings and degeneracy sets of random sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold, $(L,h^L)$ be a positive line bundle, and $(E,h^E)$ be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle of rank $r$ on $X$. We prove that the pullback by the Kodaira embedding associated to $L^p\otimes E$ of the $k$-th Chern class of the dual of the universal bundle over the Grassmannian converges as $p\to\infty$ to the $k$-th power of the Chern form $c_1(L,h^L)$, for $0\leq k\leq r$. If $c_1(L,h^L)=\omega$ we also determine the second term in the semiclassical expansion, which involves $c_1(E,h^E)$. As a consequence we show that the limit distribution of zeros of random sequences of holomorphic sections of high powers $L^p\otimes E$ is $c_1(L,h^L)^r$. Furthermore, we compute the expectation of the currents of integration along degeneracy sets of random holomorphic sections.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Siegel disc as symplectic and Kaehler quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the restricted infinite-dimensional Siegel disc as a Marsden-Weinstein symplectic reduced space and as Kaehler quotient of a weak Kaehler manifold. The obtained symplectic form is invariant with respect to the left action of the infinite-dimensional restricted symplectic group and coincides with the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form of the restricted Siegel disc obtained via the identification with an affine coadjoint orbit of the restricted symplectic group, or equivalently with a coadjoint orbit of the universal central extension of the restricted symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein--Maxwell--charged scalar field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a scale-critical trapped surface formation result for the Einstein--Maxwell--charged scalar field (EMCSF) system, without any symmetry assumptions. Specifically, we establish a scale-critical semi-global existence theorem from past null infinity and show that the focusing of gravitational waves, the concentration of electromagnetic fields, or the condensation of complex scalar fields, each individually, can lead to the formation of a trapped surface. In addition, we capture a nontrivial charging process along past null infinity, which introduces new difficulties due to the abnormal behavior of the matter fields. Nevertheless, the semi-global existence result and the formation of a trapped surface remain valid.</description>

      <title>Topics in polar actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are the notes for a series of lectures at the Institute of Geometry and Topology of the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in July 13-15, 2022. We assume basic knowledge of isometric actions on Riemannian manifolds, including the normal slice theorem and the principal orbit type theorem. Lecture 1 introduces polar actions and culminates with Heintze, Liu and Olmos's argument to characterize them in terms of integrability of the distribution of normal spaces to the principal orbits. The other two lectures are devoted to two of Lytchak and Thorbergsson's results. In Lecture 2 we briefly review Riemannian orbifolds from the metric point of view, and explain their characterization of orbifold points in the orbit space of a proper and isometric action in terms of polarity of the slice representation above. In Lecture 3 we present their proof of the fact that variationally complete actions in the sense of Bott and Samelson on non-negatively curved manifolds are hyperpolar. The appendix contains explanations of some results used in the lectures, namely: a more or less self-contained derivation of Wilking's transversal Jacobi equation; a discussion of Cartan's and Hermann's criterions for the existence of totally geodesic submanifolds, and a criterion for the polarity of isometric actions on symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For varifolds whose first variation is representable by integration, we introduce the notion of indecomposability with respect to locally Lipschitzian real valued functions. Unlike indecomposability, this weaker connectedness property is inherited by varifolds associated with solutions to geometric variational problems phrased in terms of sets, $G$ chains, and immersions; yet it is strong enough for the subsequent deduction of substantial geometric consequences therefrom. Our present study is based on several further concepts for varifolds put forward in this paper: real valued functions of generalised bounded variation thereon, partitions thereof in general, partition thereof along a real valued generalised weakly differentiable function in particular, and local finiteness of decompositions.</description>

      <title>Delocalized eta invariants of the signature operator on G-proper manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, linear real reductive group and let $X$ be a cocompact $G$-proper manifold without boundary. We define delocalized eta invariants associated to a $L^2$-invertible perturbed Dirac operator $D_X+A$ with $A$ a suitable smoothing perturbation. We also investigate the case in which $D_X$ is not invertible but $0$ is isolated in the $L^2$-spectrum of $D_X$. We prove index formulas relating these delocalized eta invariants to Atiyah-Patodi-Singer delocalized indices on $G$-proper manifolds with boundary. In order to achieve this program we give a detailed account of both the large and small time behaviour of the heat-kernel of perturbed Dirac operators, as a map from the positive real line to the algebra of Lafforgue integral operators. We apply these results to the definition of rho-numbers associated to $G$-homotopy equivalences between closed $G$-proper manifolds and to the study of their bordism properties. We also define delocalized signatures of manifolds with boundary satisfying an invertibility assumption on the differential form Laplacian of the boundary in middle degree and prove an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer formula for these delocalized signatures.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $D$ be a simple normal crossing divisor on $X$ such that $K_X+D$ is big and nef. We first prove that the singular K\"ahler--Einstein metric constructed by Berman--Guenancia is almost-complete on $X \backslash D$ in the sense of Tian--Yau. In our second main result, we establish the weak convergence of conic K\"ahler--Einstein metrics of negative curvature to the above-mentioned metric when $K_X+D$ is merely big, answering partly a recent question posed by Biquard--Guenancia. Potentials of low energy play an important role in our approach.</description>

      <title>On Integrable Nets in General and Concordant Chebyshev Nets in Particular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12626v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general integrable curve nets in Euclidean space as a particular integrable geometry invariant with respect to rigid motions and net-preserving reparameterisations. For the purpose of their description, we first give an overview of the most important second-order invariants and relations among them. As a particular integrable example, we reinterpret the result of I.S. Krasil'shchik and M. Marvan (see Section 2, Case 2 in [Acta Appl. Math. 56 (1999), 217-230]) as a curve net satisfying an $\mathbb R$-linear relation between the Schief curvature of the net and the Gauss curvature of the supporting surface. In the special case when the curvatures are proportional (concordant nets), we find a correspondence to pairs of pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures. Conversely, we also show that two generic pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures induce a concordant Chebyshev net. The construction generalises the well-known correspondence between pairs of curves and translation surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize double bracket vector fields, originally defined on semisimple Lie algebras, to Poisson manifolds equipped with a pseudo-Riemannian metric by utilizing a symmetric contravariant 2-tensor field. We extend the normal metric on an adjoint orbit of a compact semisimple Lie algebra to ensure that these vector fields become gradient vector fields on each symplectic leaf. Furthermore, we apply this construction to enhance the equilibria of Hamiltonian systems, specifically addressing the challenge of asymptotically stabilizing points that are already stable, through dissipation terms derived from generalized double bracket vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $d$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ have unit norm. We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>

Abstract: We show that, up to biholomorphism, a given noncompact complex manifold only admits one shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton with Ricci curvature tending to zero at infinity. Our result does not require fixing the asymptotic data of the metric, nor fixing the soliton vector field. The method used to prove the uniqueness of the soliton vector field can be applied more widely, for example to show that conical Calabi-Yau metrics on a given complex manifold are unique up to biholomorphism. We also use it to prove that if two polarized Fano fibrations, as introduced by Sun-Zhang, are biholomorphic, then they are isomorphic as algebraic varieties.</description>

Abstract: We give conserved quantities of two generalizations of conformal circles on the conformal sphere. One generalization concerns curves carrying a distinguished parallel tractor along them, which can be used to construct the conserved quantities. The other is the class of curves satisfying the conformal Mercator equation, the conserved quantities of which are computed using Lagrangian formalism. The two generalizations are not disjoint, and our main result is the relation between their conserved quantities. Explicit examples are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

Abstract: The Floer cohomology and the Fukaya category are not defined in general. Indeed, while the issue of obstructions can be theoretically addressed by introducing bounding cochains, the actual existence of even one such bounding cochain is usually unknown. This paper aims to deal with the problem. We study certain non-archimedean analytic structure that enriches the Maurer-Cartan theory of bounding cochains. Using this rigid structure and family Floer techniques, we prove that within a connected family of graded Lagrangian submanifolds, if any one Lagrangian is unobstructed (in a slightly stronger sense), then all remaining Lagrangians are automatically unobstructed.</description>

Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to simplify and popularise the construction from the 2013 paper by Apostolov, Calderbank, and Gauduchon, which (among other things) derives the Plebanski-Demianski family of solutions of GR using ideas of complex geometry. The starting point of this construction is the observation that the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different commuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields. After some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is half-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter subfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to Kerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is self-contained and elementary, in the sense of being mostly an exercise in linear algebra.</description>

Abstract: The Steklov spectrum of a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary is the set of eigenvalues counted with multiplicities of its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. (DN map) This article is devoted to the Steklov spectral inverse problem of recovering the metric $g$, up to natural gauge invariance, from its Steklov spectrum. Positive results are established in dimension $n\geq 3$ for conformal metrics under the assumption that the geodesic flow on the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. The paper combines wave trace formula techniques with the injectivity of the geodesic X-ray transform for functions on closed Anosov manifolds. It is shown that knowledge of the Steklov spectrum determines the jet at the boundary of the underlying Riemannian metric within its conformal class. In this particular context, this parallels the well-known results of the Calder\'on problem, where we are given the entire Dirichlet-to-Neumann map instead. As a simple corollary, assuming real-analyticity of the conformal factor, Steklov isospectral metrics must coincide. Using similar arguments, we are also able to prove under the same assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow on the boundary, that generically any smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the Steklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by the spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\"odinger operator with potential $q$. Consequently, in this case, two analytic Steklov isospectral potentials must be equal.</description>

      <title>A representation of range decreasing group homomorphisms</title>

Abstract: The method of range decreasing group homomorphisms can be applied to study various maps between mapping spaces, includin holomorphic maps, group homomorphisms, linear maps, semigroup homomorphisms, Lie algebra homomorphisms and algebra homomorphisms [Z1, Z2]. Previous studies on range decreasing group homomorphisms have primarily focused on specific subsets of mapping groups. In this paper, we provide a characterization of a general range decreasing group homomorphism applicable to the entire mapping group. As applications, we compute a particular class of homomorphisms between mapping groups and identify all range decreasing group homomorphisms defined on specific mapping groups.</description>
