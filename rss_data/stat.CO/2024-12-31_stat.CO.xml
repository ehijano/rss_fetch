      <title>Stochastic gradient descent estimation of generalized matrix factorization models with application to single-cell RNA sequencing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing allows the quantitation of gene expression at the individual cell level, enabling the study of cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics. Dimensionality reduction is a common preprocessing step to simplify the visualization, clustering, and phenotypic characterization of samples. This step, often performed using principal component analysis or closely related methods, is challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. In this work, we present a generalized matrix factorization model assuming a general exponential dispersion family distribution and we show that many of the proposed approaches in the single-cell dimensionality reduction literature can be seen as special cases of this model. Furthermore, we propose a scalable adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm that allows us to estimate the model efficiently, enabling the analysis of millions of cells. Our contribution extends to introducing a novel warm start initialization method, designed to accelerate algorithm convergence and increase the precision of final estimates. Moreover, we discuss strategies for dealing with missing values and model selection. We benchmark the proposed algorithm through extensive numerical experiments against state-of-the-art methods and showcase its use in real-world biological applications. The proposed method systematically outperforms existing methods of both generalized and non-negative matrix factorization, demonstrating faster execution times while maintaining, or even enhancing, matrix reconstruction fidelity and accuracy in biological signal extraction. Finally, all the methods discussed here are implemented in an efficient open-source R package, sgdGMF, available at github/CristianCastiglione/sgdGMF</description>

      <title>Modular probabilistic programming with algebraic effects (MSc Thesis 2019)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming languages, which exist in abundance, are languages that allow users to calculate probability distributions defined by probabilistic programs, by using inference algorithms. However, the underlying inference algorithms are not implemented in a modular fashion, though, the algorithms are presented as a composition of other inference components. This discordance between the theory and the practice of Bayesian machine learning, means that reasoning about the correctness of probabilistic programs is more difficult, and composing inference algorithms together in code may not necessarily produce correct compound inference algorithms. In this dissertation, I create a modular probabilistic programming library, already a nice property as its not a standalone language, called Koka Bayes, that is based off of both the modular design of Monad Bayes -- a probabilistic programming library developed in Haskell -- and its semantic validation. The library is embedded in a recently created programming language, Koka, that supports algebraic effect handlers and expressive effect types -- novel programming abstractions that support modular programming. Effects are generalizations of computational side-effects, and it turns out that fundamental operations in probabilistic programming such as probabilistic choice and conditioning are instances of effects.</description>

      <title>EM algorithms for optimization problems with polynomial objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is regarded as an MM (Majorization-Minimization) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of statistical models. Expanding this view, this paper demonstrates that by choosing an appropriate probability distribution, even nonstatistical optimization problem can be cast as a negative log-likelihood-like minimization problem, which can be approached by an EM (or MM) algorithm. When a polynomial objective is optimized over a simple polyhedral feasible set and an exponential family distribution is employed, the EM algorithm can be reduced to a natural gradient descent of the employed distribution with a constant step size. This is demonstrated through three examples. In this paper, we demonstrate the global convergence of specific cases with some exponential family distributions in a general form. In instances when the feasible set is not sufficiently simple, the use of MM algorithms can nevertheless be adequately described. When the objective is to minimize a convex quadratic function and the constraints are polyhedral, global convergence can also be established based on the existing results for an entropy-like proximal point algorithm.</description>

      <title>LEARNER: A Transfer Learning Method for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix estimation is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. In the context of heterogeneous data generated from diverse sources, a key challenge lies in leveraging data from a source population to enhance the estimation of a low-rank matrix in a target population of interest. One such example is estimating associations between genetic variants and diseases in non-European ancestry groups. We propose an approach that leverages similarity in the latent row and column spaces between the source and target populations to improve estimation in the target population, which we refer to as LatEnt spAce-based tRaNsfer lEaRning (LEARNER). LEARNER is based on performing a low-rank approximation of the target population data which penalizes differences between the latent row and column spaces between the source and target populations. We present a cross-validation approach that allows the method to adapt to the degree of heterogeneity across populations. We conducted extensive simulations which found that LEARNER often outperforms the benchmark approach that only uses the target population data, especially as the signal-to-noise ratio in the source population increases. We also performed an illustrative application and empirical comparison of LEARNER and benchmark approaches in a re-analysis of a genome-wide association study in the BioBank Japan cohort. LEARNER is implemented in the R package learner.</description>

      <title>Optimal rolling of fair dice using fair coins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1976, Knuth and Yao presented an algorithm for sampling from a finite distribution using flips of a fair coin that on average used the optimal number of flips. Here we show how to easily run their algorithm for the special case of rolling a fair die that uses memory linear in the input. Analysis of this algorithm yields a bound on the average number of coin flips needed that is slightly better than the original Knuth-Yao bound. This can then be extended to discrete distributions in a near optimal number of flips again using memory linear in the input.</description>

      <title>Robust Matrix Completion for Discrete Rating-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix completion has gained considerable interest in recent years. The goal of matrix completion is to predict the unknown entries of a partially observed matrix using its known entries. Although common applications feature discrete rating-scale data, such as user-product rating matrices in recommender systems or surveys in the social and behavioral sciences, methods for matrix completion are almost always designed for and studied in the context of continuous data. Furthermore, only a small subset of the literature considers matrix completion in the presence of corrupted observations despite their common occurrence in practice. Examples include attacks on recommender systems (i.e., malicious users deliberately manipulating ratings to influence the recommender system to their advantage), or careless respondents in surveys (i.e., respondents providing answers irrespective of what the survey asks of them due to a lack of attention). We introduce a matrix completion algorithm that is tailored towards the discrete nature of rating-scale data and robust to the presence of corrupted observations. In addition, we investigate the performance of the proposed method and its competitors with discrete rating-scale (rather than continuous) data as well as under various missing data mechanisms and types of corrupted observations.</description>
