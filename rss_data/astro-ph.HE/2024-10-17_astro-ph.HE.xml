      <title>Resonant Capture of Stars by Black Hole Binaries: Extreme Eccentricity Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole (MBH) binaries in galactic nuclei are one of the leading sources of $\sim$ mHz gravitational waves (GWs) for future missions such as $\rm{\textit{LISA}}$. However, the poor sky localization of GW interferometers will make it challenging to identify the host galaxy of MBH mergers absent an electromagnetic counterpart. One such counterpart is the tidal disruption of a star that has been captured into mean motion resonance with the inspiraling binary. Here we investigate the production of tidal disruption events (TDEs) through capture into, and subsequent evolution in, orbital resonance. We examine the full nonlinear evolution of planar autoresonance for stars that lock in to autoresonance with a shrinking MBH binary. Capture into the 2:1 resonance is guaranteed for any realistic astrophysical parameters (given a relatively small MBH binary mass ratio), and the captured star eventually attains an eccentricity $e\approx 1$, leading to a TDE. Stellar disks can be produced around MBHs following an active galactic nucleus episode, and we estimate the TDE rates from resonant capture produced when a secondary MBH begins inspiralling through such a disk. In some cases, the last resonant TDE can occur within a decade of the eventual $\rm{\textit{LISA}}$ signal, helping to localize the GW event.</description>

      <title>Thermal solutions of strongly magnetized disks and the hysteresis in X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binaries (XRBs) exhibit spectral hysteresis for luminosities in the range $10^{-2}\lesssim L/L_\mathrm{Edd}\lesssim 0.3$, with a hard X-ray spectral state that persists from quiescent luminosities up to $\gtrsim 0.3L_\mathrm{Edd}$, transitioning to a soft spectral state that survives with decreasing luminosities down to $\sim 10^{-2}L_\mathrm{Edd}$. We present a possible approach to explain this behavior based on the thermal properties of a magnetically arrested disk simulation. By post-processing the simulation to include radiative effects, we solve for all the thermal equilibrium solutions as the accretion rate, $\dot{M}$, varies along the XRB outburst. For an assumed scaling of the disk scale height and accretion speed with temperature, we find that there exists two solutions in the range of $ 10^{-3}\lesssim\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Eddington} \lesssim 0.1$ at $r=8\:r_g$ ($ 4\times10^{-2}\lesssim\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Eddington} \lesssim 0.5$ at $r=3\:r_g$) : a cold, optically thick one and a hot, optically thin one. This opens the possibility of a natural thermal hysteresis in the right range of luminosities for XRBs. We stress that our scenario for the hysteresis does not require to invoke the strong-ADAF principle nor does it require for the magnetization of the disk to change along the XRB outburst. In fact, our scenario requires a highly magnetized disk in the cold, soft state to reproduce the soft-to-hard state transition at the right luminosities. Hence, a prediction of our scenario is that there should be a jet, although possibly very weakly dissipative, in the soft state of XRBs. We also predict that if active galactic nuclei (AGN) have similar hysteresis cycles and are strongly magnetized, they should undergo a soft-to-hard state transition at much lower $L/L_\mathrm{Edd}$ than XRBs.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>SPHERE-3: tackling the problem of primary cosmic ray mass composition with a new approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Cherenkov telescope of the SPHERE type is under development. Its main goal is to promote the solution of the problem of the primary cosmic ray mass composition at ultra high energies (1--100 PeV) using a newly developed technique of the primary mass assignment to EAS event on event-by-event basis. The telescope will carry out measurements of both the Cherenkov light reflected from the snow surface as well as the direct one. Sensitivity of the direct Cherenkov images' shapes to the primary mass is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration Time due to Turbulent-Induced Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate a crucial parameter for understanding particle acceleration theory via turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection: the particle acceleration time. We examine particles accelerated either during the jet's dynamic evolution or in a post-processing, nearly stationary regime. We derive the particle acceleration time and compare it with theoretical predictions for both the Fermi and drift regimes identified in the simulations. In the Fermi regime, the acceleration time is expected to be independent of the particles' energy, for constant reconnection velocity, as energy increases exponentially with time. Conversely, we expect the reconnection acceleration time to depend on the current sheet's thickness and the reconnection velocity, a dependence recently revisited by xu and lazarian 2023. They identified three conditions for \(t_{acc}\). We tested these relations using statistical distributions of the current sheets' thickness and reconnection velocities in the turbulent jet over time. The resulting average value of \(t_{acc}\) was found to be nearly constant with particle energy. We compared this acceleration time with the average acceleration time derived directly from 50,000 particles accelerated in situ in the same relativistic jet. When considering a longer time interval for particle acceleration in a nearly stationary snapshot of the turbulent jet, we find that the acceleration time during the Fermi regime remains nearly independent of particle energy and aligns with the acceleration time theoretical relations up to the threshold energy, attained when the particles Larmor radius becomes as large as the thickness of the largest current sheets. Beyond this threshold, the acceleration regime shifts to the slower drift regime, showing strong energy dependence, as predicted. The results also indicate a clear dominance of the Fermi regime of acceleration.</description>

      <title>Wavelet analysis of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in MAXI J1803$-$298 observed with Insight-HXMT and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With data observed by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) and the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit {NICER}), we study low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) of the black hole candidate MAXI J1803$-$298 during the 2021 outburst. Based on hardness intensity diagram and difference of the QPOs properties, Type-C and Type-B QPOs are found in the low-hard state and soft intermediate state, respectively. After searching for and classifying QPOs in Fourier domains, we extract the QPO component and study it with wavelet analysis. The QPO and no-QPO time intervals are separated by the confidence level, so that the S-factor, which is defined as the ratio of the QPO time interval to the total length of good time interval, is calculated. We found S-factors decrease with QPOs frequency for Type-C QPOs but stay stable around zero for Type-B QPOs. The relation of S-factor of Type-C QPOs and photon energy, the correlation of S-factor and counts are also studied. Different correlation of S-factor and counts for different energy bands indicates different origins of QPOs in high energy and low energy bands, which may be due to a dual-corona scenario.</description>

      <title>A Neutron Capture Explanation for the 10 MeV Emission Line Seen in GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest ever gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A displays a significant emission line component around 10 MeV. As the GRB central engine is neutron-rich, we propose that the emission line could be originally due to the 2.223 MeV gamma-rays following neutron capture with protons. The measured line profile can be adequately fitted with a neutron capture model that involves thermal broadening and a bulk Doppler shift. The spectral modeling reveals a Doppler factor varying from 5.1 to 2.1 for the neutron-rich component, along with a temperature increase from 300 keV to about 900 keV, during the time interval of 280--360 s since the trigger, with about $10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$ deuteriums produced in the process. We argue that neutron capture can take place in the outer shell of a structure jet. Disk winds could be another possible site.</description>

      <title>Distinguishability of a naked singularity from a black hole in dynamics and radiative signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a naked singularity (NkS) be distinguished from a black hole (BH)? We have investigated it with cutting-edge general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, followed by general relativistic radiation transfer (GRRT) calculation for magnetized accretion flow around NkS and BH. Based on our simulations, the accreting matter close enough to the singularity repels due to effective potential. This prevents matter from reaching a NkS and forms a quasi-spherical symmetric density distribution around it, unlike the accretion flows around a BH. We observe an order of magnitude higher mass flux through the jet and much stronger wind from a NkS than a BH. We found that the jet launching mechanism in a NkS differs significantly from that in a BH. In the horizon-scale images, a NKs shows a photon arc instead of a photon ring that is shown around a BH. In summary, the flow dynamics and radiative properties around an NkS are distinctly different from a BH. These properties would be useful to either confirm or rule out such exotic compact objects through future observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the supernova remnant contribution to the first LHAASO source catalog via passively illuminated interstellar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are considered as the most promising source class to account for the bulk of the Galactic cosmic-ray flux. Yet amongst the population of ultra-high energy (UHE) sources that has recently emerged, due to high-altitude particle detector experiments such as LHAASO and HAWC, remarkably few are associated with known SNRs. These observations might well indicate that the highest energy particles would escape the remnant early during the shock evolution as a result of its reduced confinement capabilities. This flux of escaping particles may then encounter dense targets (gas and dust) for hadronic interactions in the form of both atomic and molecular material such as interstellar clouds, thereby generating a UHE gamma-ray flux. We explore such a scenario here, considering known SNRs in a physically driven model for particle escape, and as coupled to molecular clouds in the Galaxy. Our analysis allows the investigation of SNR-illuminated clouds in coincidence with sources detected in the first LHAASO catalogue. Indeed, the illuminated interstellar clouds may contribute to the total gamma-ray flux from several unidentified sources, as we discuss here. Yet we nevertheless find that further detailed studies will be necessary to verify or refute this scenario of passive UHE gamma-ray sources in future.</description>

      <title>Pushchino multibeam pulsar search -- V. The bright FRB 20190203 detected at 111 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a bright pulse having a dispersion measure (DM) equal to 134.4 \pm 2 pc cm^{-3}, a peak flux density (S_p) equal to 20 \pm 4 Jy and a half-width (W_e) equal to 211 \pm 6 ms. The excessive DM of the pulse, after taking into account the Milky Way contribution, is 114 pc cm^{-3} that indicates its extragalactic origin. Such value of DM corresponds to the luminosity distance 713 Mpc. The above parameters make the pulse to be a reliable candidate to the fast radio burst (FRB) event, and then it is the second FRB detected at such a large \lambda \sim 2.7 m wavelength and the first one among non-repeating FRBs. The normalized luminosity L_\nu of the event, which we have designated as FRB 20190203, estimated under assumption that the whole excessive DM is determined by the intergalactic environment toward the host galaxy, is equal to \simeq 10^{34} erg s^{-1} Hz{-1}. In addition to the study of radio data we analyzed data from the quasi-simultaneous observations of the sky in the high energy (\ge 80 keV) band by the omnidirectional detector SPI/ACS aboard the INTEGRAL orbital observatory (in order to look for a possible gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 20190203). We did not detect any transient events exceeding the background at a statistically significant level. In the INTEGRAL archive, the FRB 20190203 localization region has been observed many times with a total exposure of \sim 73.2 days. We have analyzed the data but were unable to find any reliable short gamma-ray bursts from the FRB 20190203 position. Finally we note that the observed properties of FRB 20190203 can be reproduced well in the framework of a maser synchrotron model operating in the far reverse shock (at a distance of \sim 10^{15} cm) of a magnetar. However, triggering the burst requires a high conversion efficiency (at the level of 1%) of the shock wave energy into the radio emission.</description>

      <title>Millisecond pulsars phenomenology under the light of graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute and apply the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the binary millisecond pulsar population, and discuss aspects of the known phenomenology of these systems in this context. We find that the MST effectively separates different classes of spider pulsars, eclipsing radio pulsars in tight binary systems either with a companion with a mass in the range of approximately 0.1-0.8 solar masses (redbacks) or with a companion of less than or approximately 0.06 solar masses (black widows), into distinct branches. The MST also separates black widows located in globular clusters from those found in the field and groups other pulsar classes of interest, including transitional millisecond pulsars. Using the MST and a defined ranking for similarity, we identify possible candidates likely to belong to these pulsar classes. In particular, based on this approach, we propose the black widows' classification of J1300+1240, J1630+3550, J1317-0157, J1221-0633, J1627+3219, J1737-0314A, and J1701-3006F, discuss that of J1908+2105, and analyze J1723-2837, J1431-4715, and J1902-5105 as possible transitional systems. We introduce an algorithm that quickly locates where new pulsars fall within the MST and use this to examine the positions of the transitional millisecond pulsar IGR J18245-2452 (PSR J1824-2452I), the transitional millisecond pulsar candidate 3FGL J1544.6-1125, and the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. Assessing the positions of these sources in the MST assuming a range for their unknown variables (e.g., the spin period derivative of PSR J1824-2452I) we can effectively narrow down the parameter space necessary for searching and determining key pulsar parameters through targeted observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of stratified rotation on the moment of inertia of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigid (Uniform) rotation is usually assumed when investigating the properties of mature neutron stars (NSs). Although it simplifies their description, it is an assumption because we cannot observe the NS's innermost parts. Here, we analyze the structure of NSs in the simple case of ''almost rigidity,'' where the innermost and outermost parts rotate with different angular velocities. This is motivated by the possibility of NSs having superfluid interiors, phase transitions, and angular momentum transfer during accretion processes. We show that, in general relativity, the relative difference in angular velocity between different parts of an NS induces a change in the moment of inertia compared to that of rigid rotation. The relative change depends nonlinearly on where the angular velocity jump occurs inside the NS. For the same observed angular velocity in both configurations, if the jump location is close to the star's surface-which is possible in central compact objects (CCOs) and accreting stars-the relative change in the moment of inertia is close to that of the angular velocity (which is expected due to total angular momentum aspects). If the jump occurs deep within the NS, for instance, due to phase transitions or superfluidity, smaller relative changes in the moment of inertia are observed; we found that if it is at a radial distance smaller than approximately $40\%$ of the star's radius, the relative changes are negligible. Additionally, we outline the relevance of systematic uncertainties that nonrigidity could have on some NS observables, such as radius, ellipticity, and the rotational energy budget of pulsars, which could explain the X-ray luminosity of some sources. Finally, we also show that non-rigidity weakens the universal $I$-Love-$Q$ relations.</description>

      <title>Failed supernova explosions increase the duration of star formation in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The duration of star formation (SF) in globular clusters (GCs) is an essential aspect for understanding their formation. Contrary to previous presumptions that all stars above 8 M explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), recent evidence suggests a more complex scenario. Aims. We analyse iron spread observations from 55 GCs to estimate the number of CCSNe explosions before SF termination, thereby determining the SF duration. This work for the first time takes the possibility of failed CCSNe into account, when estimating the SF duration. Methods. Two scenarios are considered: one where all stars explode as CCSNe and another where only stars below 20 M lead to CCSNe, as most CCSN models predict that no failed CCSNe happen below 20 M . Results. This establishes a lower ($\approx$ 3.5 Myr) and an upper ($\approx$ 10.5 Myr) limit for the duration of SF. Extending the findings of our previous paper, this study indicates a significant difference in SF duration based on CCSN outcomes, with failed CCSNe extending SF by up to a factor of three. Additionally, a new code is introduced to compute the SF duration for a given CCSN model. Conclusions. The extended SF has important implications on GC formation, including enhanced pollution from stellar winds and increased binary star encounters. These results underscore the need for a refined understanding of CCSNe in estimating SF durations and the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.</description>

      <title>Measurement of attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers provides important information regarding the generation and development of air showers. This information can be used not only to improve the description of such showers but also to test fundamental models of hadronic interactions. Using data from the LHAASO-KM2A experiment, the development of the muon content in high-energy air showers was studied. The attenuation length of muon content in the air showers was measured from experimental data in the energy range from 0.3 to 30 PeV using the constant intensity cut method. By comparing the attenuation length of the muon content with predictions from high-energy hadronic interaction models (QGSJET-II-04, SIBYLL 2.3d, and EPOS-LHC), it is evident that LHAASO results are significantly shorter than those predicted by the first two models (QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d) but relatively close to those predicted by the third model (EPOS-LHC). Thus, the LHAASO data favor the EPOS-LHC model over the other two models. The three interaction models confirmed an increasing trend in the attenuation length as the cosmic-ray energy increases.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales: Coupling the galactic nucleus to the larger cosmic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling black hole (BH) feeding and feedback involves interactions across vast spatial and temporal scales that is computationally challenging. Tracking gas inflows and outflows from kilo-parsec scales to the event horizon for non-spinning BHs in the presence of strong magnetic fields, Cho et al. (2023, 2024) report strong suppression of accretion on horizon scales and low (2%) feedback efficiency. In this letter, we explore the impact of these findings for the supermassive BHs M87* and Sgr A*, using high-resolution, non-cosmological, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) model. With no feedback, we find rapid BH growth due to "cooling flows," and for 2% efficiency feedback, while accretion is suppressed, the rates still remain higher than constraints from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021, 2022) for M87* and Sgr A*. To match EHT observations of M87*, a feedback efficiency greater than 15% is required, suggesting the need to include enhanced feedback from BH spin. Similarly, a feedback efficiency of $&gt;15\%$ is needed for Sgr A* to match the estimated observed star formation rate of $\lesssim 2 {\rm M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. However, even with 100% feedback efficiency, the accretion rate onto Sgr A* matches with EHT data only on rare occasions in the simulations, suggesting that Sgr A* is likely in a temporary quiescent phase currently. Bridging accretion and feedback across scales, we conclude that higher feedback efficiency, possibly due to non-zero BH spin, is necessary to suppress "cooling flows" and match observed accretion and star formation rates in M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission From TeV Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHAASO Collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Plane at energies between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. While this emission is brighter than that expected from cosmic-ray interactions in the interstellar medium alone, we show that the intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess are in good agreement with that predicted from the "TeV halos" which surround the Milky Way's pulsar population. These results support the conclusion that TeV halos dominate the ultra-high-energy sky, and that these objects convert $\sim 5\%$ of their total spindown power into very-high and ultra-high-energy photons.</description>

      <title>SN 2021adxl: A luminous nearby interacting supernova in an extremely low metallicity environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 2021adxl is a slowly evolving, luminous, Type IIn supernova with asymmetric emission line profiles, similar to the well-studied SN 2010jl. We present extensive optical, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy covering ~1.5 years post discovery. SN 2021adxl occurred in an unusual environment, atop a vigorously star-forming region that is offset from its host galaxy core. The appearance of Ly-alpha, O II, as well as the compact core, would classify the host of SN 2021adxl as a Blueberry galaxy, analogous to the higher redshift Green Pea galaxies. Using several abundance indicators, we find a metallicity of the explosion environment of only 10% solar, the lowest reported metallicity for a Type IIn SN environment. SN 2021adxl reaches a peak magnitude of r ~ -20.2 mag and since discovery, SN 2021adxl has faded by only ~4 magnitudes in the r band with a cumulative radiated energy of ~1.5e50 erg over 18 months. SN 2021adxl shows strong signs of interaction with a complex circumstellar medium, seen by the detection of X-rays, revealed by the detection of coronal emission lines, and through multi-component hydrogen and helium profiles. In order to further understand this interaction, we model the H{\alpha} profile using a Monte-Carlo electron scattering code. The blueshifted high-velocity component is consistent with emission from a radially thin, spherical shell resulting in the broad emission components due to electron scattering. Using the velocity evolution of this emitting shell, we find that the SN ejecta collide with circumstellar material of at least 5 Msun, assuming a steady-state mass-loss rate of 4-6e-3 Msun per year for the first ~200 days of evolution. Continuing the observations of SN 2021adxl may reveal signatures of dust formation or an infrared excess, similar to that seen for SN 2010jl.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino detector is currently under construction at 3500 m depth offshore Capo Passero, Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea. The main science objectives are the detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the discovery of their sources. Simulations were conducted for the full KM3NeT/ARCA detector, instrumenting a volume of 1 km$^3$, to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential to point-like neutrino sources and an all-sky diffuse neutrino flux. This paper covers the reconstruction of track- and shower-like signatures, as well as the criteria employed for neutrino event selection. By leveraging both the track and shower observation channels, the KM3NeT/ARCA detector demonstrates the capability to detect the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux within half a year of operation, achieving a 5$\sigma$ statistical significance. With an angular resolution below 0.1$^\circ$ for tracks and under 2$^\circ$ for showers, the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources surpasses existing observed limits across the entire sky.</description>

      <title>A simple model of globally magnetized accretion discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic, quasi-local model for accretion discs threaded by net, vertical magnetic flux. In a simple slab geometry and ignoring stochastic mean-field dynamo effects, we calculate the large-scale field resulting from the balance between kinematic field amplification and turbulent diffusion. The ability of the disc to accumulate magnetic flux is sensitive to a single parameter dependent on the ratio of the vertical diffusion time to the Alfv\'en crossing time, and we show how the saturation levels of magnetorotational and other instabilities can govern disc structure and evolution. Under wide-ranging conditions, inflow is governed by large-scale magnetic stresses rather than internal viscous stress. We present models of such "magnetically boosted" discs and show that they lack a radiation pressure-dominated zone. Our model can account for "magnetically elevated" discs as well as instances of midplane outflow and field reversals with height that have been seen in some global simulations. Using the time-dependent features of our model, we find that the incorporation of global transport effects into disc structure can lead to steady or episodic "magnetically arrested discs" (MADs) that maximize the concentration of magnetic flux in their central regions.</description>

      <title>Parametric Survey of Nonaxisymmetric Accretion Disk Instabilities: Magnetorotational Instability to Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion disks are highly unstable to magnetic instabilities driven by shear flow, where classically, the axisymmetric, weak-field Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) has received much attention through local WKB approximations. In contrast, discrete non-axisymmetric counterparts require a more involved analysis through a full global approach to deal with the influence of the nearby magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) continua. Recently, rigorous MHD spectroscopy identified a new type of an ultra-localised, non-axisymmetric instability in global disks with super-Alfv\'enic flow. These Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities (SARIs) fill vast unstable regions in the complex eigenfrequency plane with (near-eigen)modes that corotate at the local Doppler velocity and are radially localised between Alfv\'enic resonances. Unlike discrete modes, they are utterly insensitive to the radial disk boundaries. In this work, we independently confirm the existence of these unprecedented modes using our novel spectral MHD code Legolas reproducing and extending our earlier study with detailed eigenspectra and eigenfunctions. We calculate growth rates of SARIs and MRI in a variety of disk equilibria, highlighting the impact of field strength and orientation, and find correspondence with analytical predictions for thin, weakly magnetised disks. We show that non-axisymmetric modes can significantly extend instability regimes at high mode numbers, with maximal growth rates comparable to the MRI. Furthermore, we explicitly show a region filled with quasi-modes whose eigenfunctions are extremely localised in all directions. These modes must be ubiquitous in accretion disks, and play a role in local shearing box simulations. Finally, we revisit recent dispersion relations in the Appendix, highlighting their relation to our global framework.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Diffusion Coefficient and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration Efficiency using Gamma-ray Emission from the Star-Forming Region RCW 38</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar winds from massive stars may be significant sources of cosmic rays (CRs). To investigate this connection, we report a detailed study of gamma-ray emission near the young Milky Way star cluster ($\approx$ 0.5 Myr old) in the star-forming region RCW 38 and compare this emission to its stellar wind properties and diffuse X-ray emission. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2 $-$ 300 GeV band, we find a significant ($ \sigma &gt; 22$) detection coincident with the star cluster, producing a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity (extrapolated over 0.1 $-$ 500 GeV) of $L_{\gamma} = (2.66\pm 0.92) \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ adopting a power-law spectral model ($\Gamma = 2.34\pm0.04$). Using an empirical relationship and Starburst99, we estimate the total wind power to be $8 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a CR acceleration efficiency of $\eta_{\rm CR} \simeq 0.4$ for an assumed diffusion coefficient consistent with $D = 10^{28}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. Alternatively, a lower acceleration efficiency of 0.1 can produce this $L_{\gamma}$ if the diffusion coefficient is smaller, $D\simeq 2.5\times10^{27}\,{\rm cm^2\,\,s^{-1}}$. Additionally, we analyze Chandra X-ray data from the region and compare the hot-gas pressure to the CR pressure. We find the former is four orders of magnitude greater, suggesting that the CR pressure is not dynamically important relative to stellar winds. As RCW 38 is too young for supernovae to have occurred, the high CR acceleration efficiency in RCW 38 demonstrates that stellar winds may be an important source of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>Probing the low-velocity regime of non-radiative shocks with neutron star bow shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-radiative shocks accelerate particles and heat astrophysical plasmas. While supernova remnants are the most well-studied example, neutron star (NS) bow shocks are also non-radiative and Balmer-dominated. NS bow shocks are likely ubiquitous in the interstellar medium due to their large speeds imparted at birth, and they are thought to be a discrete source population contributing to the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum. To date, nine NS bow shocks have been directly observed in H$\alpha$ images. Most of these shocks have been characterized using narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging and slit spectroscopy, which do not resolve the multi-component velocity structure of the shocks and their spatial geometry. Here we present integral field spectroscopy of three NS bow shocks: J0742$-$2822, J1741$-$2054, and J2225$+$6535 (the Guitar Nebula). We measure the shock properties simultaneously in four dimensions: the 2D projected shock morphology, the radial velocity structure, and the H$\alpha$ flux. The broad-to-narrow line ratio ($I_{\rm b}/I_{\rm n}$) is inferred from radial velocity profiles, and for J1741$-$2054 the narrow line is detected in multiple regions of the shock. The inferred line ratios and widths suggest that NS bow shocks represent a low shock velocity regime ($V \lesssim 200$ km/s) in which $I_{\rm b}/I_{\rm n}$ is high, distinct from the shock regime probed by supernova remnants. Our results illustrate a need for non-radiative shock models at velocities lower than previously considered, which will reveal the electron-ion temperature ratios and particle acceleration efficiencies of these bow shocks.</description>

      <title>H-AMR FORGE'd in FIRE I: Magnetic state transitions, jet launching and radiative emission in super-Eddington, highly magnetized quasar disks formed from cosmological initial conditions</title>

Abstract: Quasars are powered by supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disks, yet standard disk models are inconsistent with many quasar observations. Recently, Hopkins et al. (2024) simulated the formation of a quasar disk feeding a SMBH of mass $M=1.3\times10^7\,M_\odot$ in a host galaxy that evolved from cosmological initial conditions. The disk had surprisingly strong toroidal magnetic fields that supported it vertically from gravity and powered fast accretion. What radiation and feedback can such a system produce? To answer this, we must follow the gas to the event horizon. For this, we interpolated the accretion system onto the grid of the general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code H-AMR and performed 3D simulations with BH spins $a=0$ and $a=0.9375$. This remapping generates spurious magnetic monopoles, which we erase using a novel divergence cleaning approach. Despite the toroidal magnetic field's dominance at large radii, vertical magnetic flux builds up at the event horizon. This causes a magnetic state transition within the inner $200$ gravitational radii of the disk, where net vertical magnetic flux begins dominating the accretion flow. This powers strong winds and, if the BH spins, relativistic jets that can spin-down the BH within $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. Sometimes, vertical magnetic fields of opposite sign reach the BH, causing polarity inversion events that briefly destroy the jets and, possibly, the X-ray corona. The disk powers accretion at rates $5\times$ the Eddington limit, which can double the BH mass in $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. When $a=0.9375$ ($a=0$), the energy in outflows and radiation equals about $60\%$ ($10\%$) and $100\%$ ($3\%$) of the accreted rest mass energy, respectively. Much of the light escapes in cool, extended $\gtrsim1300\,{\rm au}$ photospheres, consistent with quasar microlensing and the ``big blue bump'' seen in spectral energy distributions.</description>

      <title>What to expect: kilonova light curve predictions via equation of state marginalization</title>

Abstract: Efficient multi-messenger observations of gravitational-wave candidates from compact binary coalescence candidate events rely on data products reported in low-latency by the International Gravitational-wave Network (IGWN). While data products such as $\texttt{HasNS}$, the probability of at least one neutron star, and $\texttt{HasRemnant}$, the probability of remnant matter forming after merger, exist, these are not direct observables for a potential kilonova. Here, we present new kilonova light curve and ejecta mass data products derived from merger quantities measured in low latency, by marginalizing over our uncertainty in our understanding of the neutron star equation of state and using measurements of the source properties of the merger, including masses and spins. Two additional types of data products are proposed. The first is the probability of a candidate event having mass ejecta ($m_{\mathrm{ej}}$) greater than $10^{-3} M_\odot$, which we denote as $\texttt{HasEjecta}$. The second are $m_{\mathrm{ej}}$ estimates and accompanying $\texttt{ugrizy}$ and $\texttt{HJK}$ kilonova light curves predictions produced from a surrogate model trained on a grid of kilonova light curves from $\texttt{POSSIS}$, a time-dependent, three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. We are developing these data products in the context of the IGWN low-latency alert infrastructure, and will be advocating for their use and release for future detections.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and pair creation in reconnection-powered coronae of accreting black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems is their hard X-ray emission which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons in the vicinity of the black hole, in a region with optical depth of order unity. The origin and composition of this Comptonizing region, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we investigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of AGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For sources with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$ (where $\lambda_{\rm Edd, crit} \sim 10^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^5$ or $\sim 10^{-2}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \gamma \gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical depths $\tau_{\rm T} \sim 0.1-10$. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity scales as $L^2_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\rm X}$ for higher $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ values. We apply our model to four Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, and discuss our results in light of recent IceCube observations.</description>

      <title>New approach to template banks of gravitational waves with higher harmonics: Reducing matched-filtering cost by over an order of magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational wave events use models, or templates, for the signals of interest. The templates used in current searches in the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) data model the dominant quadrupole mode $(\ell,|m|)=(2,2)$ of the signals, and omit sub-dominant higher-order modes (HM) such as $(\ell,|m|)=(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, which are predicted by general relativity. This omission reduces search sensitivity to black hole mergers in interesting parts of parameter space, such as systems with high masses and asymmetric mass-ratios. We develop a new strategy to include HM in template banks: instead of making templates containing a combination of different modes, we separately store normalized templates corresponding to $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$ modes. To model aligned-spin $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$ waveforms corresponding to a given $(2,2)$ waveform, we use a combination of post-Newtonian formulae and machine learning tools. In the matched filtering stage, one can filter each mode separately with the data and collect the timeseries of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). This leads to a HM template bank whose matched-filtering cost is just $\approx 3\times$ that of a quadrupole-only search (as opposed to $\approx\! 100 \times$ in previously proposed HM search methods). Our method is effectual and generally applicable for template banks constructed with either stochastic or geometric placement techniques. New GW candidate events that we detect using our HM banks and details for combining the different SNR mode timeseries are presented in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Additionally, we discuss non-linear compression of $(2,2)$-only geometric-placement template banks using machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>A dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant following LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4a and previous runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the standard dark siren method using a sample of $5$ well-covered gravitational waves (GW) alerts reported during the first part of the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run and with $3$ updated standard dark sirens from third observation run in combination the previous constraints from the first three runs. Our methodology relies on the galaxy catalogue method alone. We use a Deep Learning method to derive the full probability density estimation of photometric redshifts using the Legacy Survey catalogues. We add the constraints from well localized Binary Black Hole mergers to the sample of standard dark sirens analysed in our previous work. We combine the $H_0$ posterior for $5$ new standard sirens with other $10$ previous events (using the most recent available data for the 5 novel events and updated 3 previous posteriors from O3), finding $H_0 = 70.4^{+13.6}_{-11.7}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% Confidence interval) with the catalogue method only. This result represents an improvement of $\sim 23\%$ comparing the new $15$ dark siren constrain with the previous $10$ dark siren constraint and a reduction in uncertainty of $\sim 40\%$ from the combination of $15$ dark and bright sirens compared with the GW170817 bright siren alone. The combination of dark and bright siren GW170817 with recent jet constraints yields $H_0$ of $68.0^{+4.4}_{-3.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, a $\sim 6\%$ precision from Standard Sirens, reducing the previous constraint uncertainty by $\sim 10\%$ .</description>

      <title>A two-minute burst of highly polarised radio emission originating from low Galactic latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These "ultra-long period" (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim$200-mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are prevalent on almost all astronomical scales, but their importance in different systems and over cosmic time is yet to be understood. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. In this study, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ per cent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ per cent across the regions with polarisation detection, similar to that of local starburst galaxies. The polarised dust emission is patchy and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s, and extends over 3 kiloparsecs. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.</description>

      <title>Role of neutron pairing with density-gradient dependence in the semi-microscopic treatment of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the fourth-order extended Thomas-Fermi method with Strutinsky-integral shell and pairing corrections, we calculate the inner crust of neutron stars with the BSk31 functional, whose pairing has two terms: i) a term that is fitted to the results of microscopic calculations on homogeneous nuclear matter (accounting for both medium polarization and self-energy effects) that are more realistic than those of our earlier functionals; ii) an empirical term that is dependent on the density gradient, which permits an excellent fit to nuclear masses. Both proton and neutron pairing are taken into account, the former in the BCS theory and the latter in the local density approximation. We found that the equilibrium value of the proton number $Z$ remains 40 over the entire density range considered, whether or not neutron pairing is included. The new equation of state and the composition are very similar to those of our previously preferred functional, BSk24. However, the predicted neutron pairing fields are quite different. In particular, clusters are found to be impermeable to the neutron superfluid. The implications for the neutron superfluid dynamics are briefly discussed. Since the new pairing is more realistic, the functional BSk31 is better suited for investigating neutron superfluidity in neutron-star crusts.</description>
