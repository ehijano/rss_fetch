      <title>Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplification and reorganization of complex expressions lies at the core of scientific progress, particularly in theoretical high-energy physics. This work explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this challenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of spinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer architecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions composed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an additional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which isolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting framework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular occurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent expressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate the Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new compact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons.

      <title>A framework for generalizing toric inequalities for holographic entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture and prove a multi-parameter generalization of the toric inequalities of \cite{Czech:2023xed} for some range of parameters. In addition, we extend their proof methods for the generalized toric inequalities in two ways. The first extension constructs the graph corresponding to the toric inequalities and the generalized toric conjectures by tiling the Euclidean space. An entanglement wedge nesting relation then determines the geometric structure of the tiles. In the second extension, we exploit the cyclic nature of the inequalities and conjectures to construct cycle graphs. Then, the graph can be obtained using graph Cartesian products of cycle graphs. In addition, we define a set of knots on the graph by following \cite{Czech:2023xed}. These graphs with knots then imply the validity of their associated inequality. We study the particular case where the graph can be decomposed into disjoint unions of torii. %We extend and propopse the proof by a contraction map of toric inequalities to the conjectures. We also discuss ways to explore the conjectured inequalities whose corresponding geometries are $d$-dimensional torus $(d&gt;2)$.</description>

      <title>Kinks and double-kinks in generalized $\phi^{4n}$-and $\phi^{8n}$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining the $\phi^{4n}$ and $\phi^{8n}$ models within a two-dimensional framework in flat spacetime and embracing a theory with unconventional kinetic terms, one investigates the emergence of compactified double kinks/antikinks. We restrict our study to field configurations with minimal energy profiles, i.e., fields with Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) properties. To accomplish our goal, we adopt non-polynomial functions as generalizing terms, namely, hyperbolic sine and cosine functions. These functions manifest potential minima at $\phi=0$ in the BPS bound, facilitating the emergence of double-kinks (and double-antikinks). Moreover, as these functions are modified, the double kinks/antikinks may acquire profiles similar to configurations of fields resembling double compactons/anti-compactons.</description>

      <title>Geodesics connecting end points of time-like interval in asymptotically AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the geodesics connecting two time-like separated boundary points in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. We find that in spherically symmetry Schwarzschild AdS black hole, smooth space-like geodesics can connect timelike-separated points by winding around the horizon multiple times. Similar result will also happen in modified BTZ black hole which contains photon ring in the bulk. According to recent holographic proposal on time-like entanglement entropy, our result suggests that, if there is photon ring/sphere in the bulk, then the time-like entanglement entropy AdS3/CFT2 duality may not have an imaginary part and so further understanding may be necessary.</description>

      <title>A holographic model of magnetohydrodynamics with fortuitous SO(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetohydrodynamics using holography. The gravity model is closely related to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical black brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form symmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.</description>

      <title>Double Field Theory and $\alpha'$ corrections: explicit examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct several solutions of effective actions for string theories beyond the supergravity approximation utilizing the framework of the Double Field Theory (DFT). The DFT effective actions, which are well suited for accommodating abelian and non-abelian T dualities, are naturally written in terms of modified connections and curvatures with torsion. We construct the most general solutions with vanishing modified torsion, and such geometries don't receive quantum corrections. We also compute the leading $\alpha'$ corrections to several supergravity solutions, including a pair of geometries related by a non-abelian T duality.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry of the Robinson-Trautman solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robinson-Trautman solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system admits a shear-free and twist-free null geodesic congruence with a nonvanishing expansion. Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e., the spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification of supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to systematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the Killing spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by casting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given in hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution generically exhibits a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>Parity Violating Marginal Deformation of the 3D Gross-Neveu-Thirring Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid of the critical three dimensional Gross-Neveu and Thirring models deformed by explicit parity breaking operators is studied in the large N expansion and using the renormalization group. Two stable solutions are found. One solution is a stable charge-gapped phase with a massless photon-like vector field, massive fermions and a parametrically light scalar field which acts as a dilaton for a spontaneously broken approximate scale invariance. A second solution is a conformal window where the fermion spectrum is not gapped and the theory flows between infrared and ultraviolet fixed points, becoming a conformal field theory at the infrared fixed point. The latter is an analog of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point and it supports a novel parity and time reversal violating three dimensional conformal field theory with scalar, spinor and vector fields.</description>

      <title>Self-duality from twisted cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a notion of self-duality for differential equations of maximal cuts was introduced, which states that there should be a basis in which the matrix for an {\epsilon}-factorised differential equation is persymmetric. It was observed that the rotation to this special basis may introduce a Galois symmetry relating different integrals. We argue that the proposed notion of self-duality for maximal cuts stems from a very natural notion of self-duality from twisted cohomology. Our main result is that, if the differential equations and their duals are simultaneously brought into canonical form, the cohomology intersection matrix is a constant. Furthermore, we show that one can associate quite generically a Lie algebra representation to an {\epsilon}-factorised system. For maximal cuts, this representation is irreducible and self-dual. The constant intersection matrix can be interpreted as expressing the equivalence of this representation and its dual, which in turn results in constraints for the differential equation matrix. Unlike the earlier proposal, the most natural symmetry of the differential equation matrix is defined entirely over the rational numbers and is independent of the basis choice. As a consequence, we do not see any evidence for a Galois symmetry of the type advocated earlier.</description>

Abstract: We consider type IIB supergravity on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quotient of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ as the holographic dual of strongly coupled 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{RP}^4$ space with the gauging of charge conjugation. Using bootstrap techniques, we determine all two-point functions of $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators of arbitrary weights at the leading order in the large central charge expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism of poly-vector deformations for Type IIB backgrounds with a block diagonal metric and non-vanishing self-dual 5-form RR field strength. Making use of the embedding of the Type IIB theory into the $\mathrm{E}_{6(6)}$ exceptional field theory we derive explicit transformation rules for four-vector deformations. We prove that the algebraic condition following from the Type IIB realization of exceptional Drinfeld algebras is sufficient for the transformation to generate a solution.</description>

      <title>New Field Theories with Foliation Structure and Subdimensional Particles from Godbillon-Vey Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, subdimensional particles including fractons have attracted much attention from various areas. Notable features of such matter phases are mobility constraints and subextensive ground state degeneracies (GSDs). In this paper, we propose a BF-like theory motivated by the Godbillon-Vey invariant, which is a mathematical invariant of the foliated manifold. Our theory hosts subsystem higher form symmetries which manifestly ensure the mobility constraint and subextensive GSD through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss some lattice spin models which realize the same low energy behaviours as the BF-like theory. Furthermore, we explore dynamical matter theories which are coupled to the BF-like theory.</description>

      <title>On the electron self-energy to three loops in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electron self-energy in Quantum Electrodynamics to three loops in terms of iterated integrals over kernels of elliptic type. We make use of the differential equations method, augmented by an $\epsilon$-factorized basis, which allows us to gain full control over the differential forms appearing in the iterated integrals to all orders in the dimensional regulator. We obtain compact analytic expressions, for which we provide generalized series expansion representations that allow us to evaluate the result numerically for all values of the electron momentum squared. As a by product, we also obtain $\epsilon$-resummed results for the self-energy in the on-shell limit $p^2 = m^2$, which we use to recompute the known three-loop renormalization constants in the on-shell scheme.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Five-Point Two-Mass Planar Integrals and Double Lagrangian Insertions in a Wilson Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the complete set of planar two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell external legs. These integrals are relevant, for instance, for the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of two heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron collider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their analytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling over finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most complex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply our results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a four-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, computing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally invariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region through two loops.</description>

      <title>$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmological Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field where the axion forms a flat direction, a saddle point at $\tau=i$, and a minimum at $\tau=e^{2\pi i\over 3}$. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to certain modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermal correlators and quasinormal modes from semiclassical Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by its relevance for thermal correlators in strongly coupled holographic CFTs, we refine and further develop a recent exact analytic approach to black hole perturbation problem, based on the semiclassical Virasoro blocks, or equivalently via AGT relation, the Nekrasov partition functions in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. Focusing on asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5$ black hole backgrounds, we derive new universal exact expressions for holographic thermal two-point functions, both for scalar operators and conserved currents. Relatedly, we also obtain exact quantization conditions of the associated quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our expressions for the holographic $\text{CFT}_4$ closely resemble the well-known results for 2d thermal CFTs on $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$. This structural similarity stems from the locality of fusion transformation for Virasoro blocks. We provide numerical checks of our quantization conditions for QNMs. Additionally, we discuss the application of our results to understand specific physical properties of QNMs, including their near-extremal and asymptotic limits. The latter is related to a certain large-momentum regime of semiclassical Virasoro blocks dual to Seiberg-Witten prepotentials.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and a sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$ (with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag), which slightly reduces the Hubble tension and makes room for a more important role of late-time new physics in this context, albeit still remaining a sub-dominant part of the solution. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ inevitably raises $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ which is as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Functional Equations and Pole Structure of the Bartholdi Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bartholdi zeta function on a connected simple digraph with $n_V$ vertices and $n_E$ edges. We derive a functional equation for the Bartholdi zeta function $\zeta_G(q,u)$ on a regular graph $G$ with respect to the bump parameter $u$. We also find an equivalence between the Bartholdi zeta function with a specific value of $u$ and the Ihara zeta function at $u=0$. We determine bounds of the critical strip of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ for a general graph. If $G$ is a $(t+1)$-regular graph, the bounds are saturated and $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ and $q=(t+u)^{-1}$ are the poles at the boundaries of the critical strip for $u\ne 1, -t$. When $G$ is the regular graph and the spectrum of the adjacency matrix satisfies a certain condition, $\zeta_G(q,u)$ satisfies the so-called Riemann hypothesis. For $u \ne 1$, $q=\pm(1-u)^{-1}$ are poles of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ unless $G$ is tree. Although the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ is $n_E-n_V+1$ if $u\ne u_* \equiv 1-\frac{n_E}{n_V}$, it is enhanced at $u=u_*$. In particular, if the Moore-Penrose inverse of the incidence matrix $L^+$ and the degree vector $\vec{d}$ satisfy the condition $|L^+ \vec{d}|^2\ne n_E$, the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ increases only by one at $u=u_*$. The order of the pole at $q=-(1-u)^{-1}$ coincides with that at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ if $G$ is bipartite and is $n_E-n_V$ otherwise.</description>

      <title>Sound Speed Resonance of Gravitational Waves in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the occurrence of Sound Speed Resonances (SSR) in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation across a wide range of coupling functions and parameters. After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its potential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor modes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton stabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed of light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed oscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a distinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that these GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\textbf{SKA}$, $\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second inflationary phase.</description>

      <title>Tensor Reduction for Feynman Integrals with Lorentz and Spinor Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient graphical approach to construct projectors for the tensor reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals with both Lorentz and spinor indices in $D$ dimensions. An ansatz for the projectors is constructed making use of its symmetry properties via an orbit partition formula. The graphical approach allows to identify and enumerate the orbits in each case. For the case without spinor indices we find a 1 to 1 correspondence between orbits and integer partitions describing the cycle structure of certain bi-chord graphs. This leads to compact combinatorial formulae for the projector ansatz. With spinor indices the graph-structure becomes more involved, but the method is equally applicable. Our spinor reduction formulae are based on the antisymmetric basis of $\gamma$ matrices, and make use of their orthogonality property. We also provide a new compact formula to pass into the antisymmetric basis. We compute projectors for vacuum tensor Feynman integrals with up to 32 Lorentz indices and up to 4 spinor indices. We discuss how to employ the projectors in problems with external momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves are geometries where components of the transverse curvature have abrupt behaviour across null hypersurfaces, which are fronts of the waves. We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories on such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields as a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and are solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave front determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention is paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of non-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar shockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a plane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our analysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including geometries sourced by null particles and null branes.</description>

      <title>Gross-Witten-Wadia Phase Transition in Induced QCD on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a modification of the Kazakov-Migdal (KM) model with gauge group $U(N_c)$, where the adjoint scalar fields in the conventional KM model are replaced by $N_f$ fundamental scalar fields (FKM model). After tuning the coupling constants and eliminating the fundamental scalar fields, the partition function of this model is expressed as an integral of a graph zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model on cycle graphs at large $N_c$ exhibits the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) phase transition only when $N_f &gt; N_c$. In the large $N_c$ limit, we evaluate the free energy of the model on a general graph in two distinct parameter regimes and demonstrate that the FKM model generally consists of multiple phases. The effective action of the FKM model reduces to the standard Wilson action by taking an appropriate scaling limit when the graph consists of plaquettes (fundamental cycles) of the same size, as in the square lattice case. We show that, for the FKM model on such a graph, the third-order GWW phase transition universally occurs in this scaling limit.</description>

Abstract: Witten's open string field theory with a generalized version of stubs is reformulated as a cubic string field theory using an auxiliary string field. The gauge symmetries and equations of motion as well as the associative algebra of the resulting theory are investigated. Integrating out either the original or auxiliary field is shown to recover the conventional cubic theory. Our analysis demonstrates that deformations due to the stubs can be described as a homotopy transfer purely in the context of strong deformation retract. We also discuss to what extent the vertex regions resulting from stubs provide a model for the elementary interactions of closed string field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consistent interactions with electromagnetism and gravity for mass $m$ particles of any spin are obtained. This is done by finding interactions which preserve the covariantized massive gauge symmetry present in recently constructed massive particle actions. This gauge principle is sufficient for finding consistent completions of minimal as well as non-minimal couplings of any type. For spins $s\geq 3/2$, consistency requires infinitely many interaction terms in the action, including arbitrarily high order derivatives of electromagnetic and gravitational curvatures, with correspondingly high powers of $1/m$. These interactions may be formally resummed and expressed in terms of non-local operators. Finally, although the interactions appear non-local, evidence is presented for the existence of a field redefinition which makes the interacting action local. This work provides the first explicit realization of an exactly gauge invariant formulation of massive particles interacting with electromagnetism and gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in free bosonic quantum many-body systems. Utilizing a lattice regularization scheme, we compute symmetry-resolved R\'enyi entropies for free complex scalar fields and a specific class of non-local field theories, where entanglement entropy (EE) exhibits volume-law scaling. We present effective and approximate eigenvalues for the correlation matrix used in computing SREE and demonstrate their consistency with numerical results. Furthermore, we explore the equipartition of EE, verifying its effective behavior in the massless limit. Finally, we comment on EE in non-local quantum field theories and provide an explicit expression for the symmetry-resolved R\'enyi entropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $\alpha$-heavy conformal operators in CFT$_2$ which dimensions grow as $h = O(c^\alpha)$ with $\alpha$ being non-negative rational number and conjecture that the large-$c$ asymptotics of the respective 4-point Virasoro conformal block is exponentiated similar to the standard case of $\alpha=1$. It is shown that the leading exponent is given by a Puiseux polynomial which is a linear combination of power functions in the central charge with fractional powers decreasing from $\alpha$ to $0$ according to some pattern. Our analysis is limited by considering the first six explicit coefficients of the Virasoro block function in the coordinate. For simplicity, external primary operators are chosen to be of equal conformal dimensions that, therefore, includes the case of the vacuum conformal block. The consideration is also extended to the 4-point ${\cal W}_3$ conformal block of four semi-degenerate operators, in which case the exponentiation hypothesis works the same way. Here, only the first three block coefficients can be treated analytically.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Codes From Long Wormholes</title>

Abstract: We discuss families of approximate quantum error correcting codes which arise as the nearly-degenerate ground states of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians composed of non-commuting terms. For exact codes, the conditions for error correction can be formulated in terms of the vanishing of a two-sided mutual information in a low-temperature thermofield double state. We consider a notion of distance for approximate codes obtained by demanding that this mutual information instead be small, and we evaluate this mutual information for the SYK model and for a family of low-rank SYK models. After an extrapolation to nearly zero temperature, we find that both kinds of models produce fermionic codes with constant rate as the number, $N$, of fermions goes to infinity. For SYK, the distance scales as $N^{1/2}$, and for low-rank SYK, the distance can be arbitrarily close to linear scaling, e.g. $N^{.99}$, while maintaining a constant rate. We also consider an analog of the no low-energy trivial states property which we dub the no low-energy adiabatically accessible states property and show that these models do have low-energy states that can be prepared adiabatically in a time that does not scale with system size $N$. We discuss a holographic model of these codes in which the large code distance is a consequence of the emergence of a long wormhole geometry in a simple model of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Interplay Between Neutrino Kicks and Hydrodynamic Kicks of Neutron Stars and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are observed with high space velocities and elliptical orbits in binaries. The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry) and from aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS, which can lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption/scattering) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. In massive progenitors hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s, whereas our calculated neutrino kicks reach (55-140) km/s (estimated upper bounds of (170-265) km/s) and only about (10-50) km/s, if LESA is the main cause of asymmetric neutrino emission. Therefore hydrodynamic NS kicks dominate in explosions of high-mass progenitors, whereas LESA-induced neutrino kicks dominate for NSs born in low-energy SNe of the lowest-mass progenitors, when these explode nearly spherically. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar with its velocity of about 160 km/s, if born in the low-energy explosion of a low-mass, single-star progenitor, should have received a hydrodynamic kick in a considerably asymmetric explosion. Black holes, if formed by the collapse of short-lived PNSs and solely kicked by anisotropic neutrino emission, obtain velocities of only some km/s.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Dark Energy Models and $\Lambda$CDM Using Observational data in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the accelerated cosmic expansion in the late Universe by examining two dark energy models, viscous modified Chaplygin gas (VsMCG) and variable modified Chaplygin gas (VMCG), within loop quantum cosmology alongside the $\Lambda$CDM model. The objective is to constrain cosmic parameters using the $\Lambda$CDM model and 30 of the latest $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC), including Type Ia Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB), Quasars, and 24 uncorrelated baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements across a redshift range from 0.106 to 2.33. The latest Hubble constant measurement from Riess in 2022 is included to enhance constraints. In the $\Lambda$CDM, VsMCG, and VMCG frameworks, best-fit parameters for the Hubble parameter ($H_0$) and sound horizon ($r_d$) are obtained. The results highlight significant disparities between $H_0$ and $r_d$ values from late-time observational measurements, reflecting the known $H_0$ and $r_d$ tensions. The gravitational lensing optical depth of the two dark energy models is studied by plotting $\log(\tau(z_l)/H_0^{-3} \tau_N)$ vs $z_l$. The probability of finding gravitational lenses (optical depth) in both models increases with lens redshift $z_l$. The change in optical depth behavior for different parameter constraints is graphically analyzed. A joint analysis of VsMCG and VMCG with $\Lambda$CDM is conducted. While the models diverge in the early Universe, they are indistinguishable at low redshift. Using the Akaike information criteria, the analysis indicates that neither dark energy model can be</description>

Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples (even including some simple sources) for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having collinear components, which do not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the co-planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks, based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. For both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, we show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network, thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. Moreover, our approach illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer. Our results provide a concrete link between the flow of information and the trainability of deep neural networks, further explaining the role of criticality in these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Representation-theoretical characterization of canonical custodial symmetry in NHDM potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a dynamical, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and formulate a set of linear stability conditions for high energy perturbation modes above an arbitrary solution. In this general setting we derive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity waves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled photon. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories, which satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light over a cosmological background, feature gravity waves propagating at luminal speeds above a time-dependent inhomogeneous background as well.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances, when the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) gauge is adopted. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to be, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity in the KS gauge. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of the regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>
