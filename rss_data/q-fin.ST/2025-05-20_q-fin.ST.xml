      <title>Hierarchical Representations for Evolving Acyclic Vector Autoregressions (HEAVe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal networks offer an intuitive framework to understand influence structures within time series systems. However, the presence of cycles can obscure dynamic relationships and hinder hierarchical analysis. These networks are typically identified through multivariate predictive modelling, but enforcing acyclic constraints significantly increases computational and analytical complexity. Despite recent advances, there remains a lack of simple, flexible approaches that are easily tailorable to specific problem instances. We propose an evolutionary approach to fitting acyclic vector autoregressive processes and introduces a novel hierarchical representation that directly models structural elements within a time series system. On simulated datasets, our model retains most of the predictive accuracy of unconstrained models and outperforms permutation-based alternatives. When applied to a dataset of 100 cryptocurrency return series, our method generates acyclic causal networks capturing key structural properties of the unconstrained model. The acyclic networks are approximately sub-graphs of the unconstrained networks, and most of the removed links originate from low-influence nodes. Given the high levels of feature preservation, we conclude that this cryptocurrency price system functions largely hierarchically. Our findings demonstrate a flexible, intuitive approach for identifying hierarchical causal networks in time series systems, with broad applications to fields like econometrics and social network analysis.</description>

      <title>Characterizing asymmetric and bimodal long-term financial return distributions through quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of logarithmic return distributions defined over large time scales is crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of asset price movements. For large time scales of the order of two trading years, the anticipated Gaussian behavior of the returns often does not emerge, and their distributions often exhibit a high level of asymmetry and bimodality. These features are inadequately captured by the majority of classical models to address financial time series and return distributions. In the presented analysis, we use a model based on the discrete-time quantum walk to characterize the observed asymmetry and bimodality. The quantum walk distinguishes itself from a classical diffusion process by the occurrence of interference effects, which allows for the generation of bimodal and asymmetric probability distributions. By capturing the broader trends and patterns that emerge over extended periods, this analysis complements traditional short-term models and offers opportunities to more accurately describe the probabilistic structure underlying long-term financial decisions.</description>
