      <title>Observation of flow vector fluctuations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}_{_{\bf NN}}}}=$ 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) dependent flow vector fluctuations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are presented. By studying long-range two-particle correlations with a template fit method, potential biases from non-flow effects such as jets and resonance decays are effectively suppressed. Significant $p_{\rm T}$- and $\eta$-dependent fluctuations of the second-harmonic flow vector are observed with more than 5$\sigma$ confidence in p$-$Pb collisions, similar to the observations in Pb$-$Pb collisions. The influence of residual non-flow effects has been evaluated and cannot account for the observed fluctuations, thereby confirming the observation of flow vector fluctuations in small collision systems at the LHC. Comparisons to model calculations from 3DGlauber+MUSIC+UrQMD and the parton transport model from AMPT are also presented. The measurements provide constraints on the theoretical modelling of the three-dimensional initial geometry and its event-by-event fluctuations, offering critical insights into the origin of collective flow in small collision systems at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and multiplicity-dependent pseudorapidity densities of charged particles in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s} = 13.6}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the pseudorapidity density of primary charged particles (${\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/ {\rm d}\eta$) in $|\eta|&lt;1.5$ is measured in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV using the ALICE detector. Tracks are reconstructed with the upgraded Inner Tracking System and Time Projection Chamber, and results are reported for the INEL$&gt;$0 event class (events having at least one charged particle in $|\eta|&lt;1$). The multiplicity dependence of the pseudorapidity density of charged particles is also explored with the multiplicity determined by the forward detectors.
  The average charged-particle pseudorapidity density at midrapidity ($|\eta|&lt;0.5$) is measured to be $\langle \mathrm{d}N_{\mathrm{ch}}/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle = 7.10 \pm 0.18$. Combined with lower-energy measurements, the INEL$&gt;$0 results follow a power-law scaling with the center-of-mass energy. These measurements provide a new reference for charged-particle production at the highest proton$-$proton collision energy available at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Search for direct reaction products in 197Au+ 20Ne from 108 to 171 MeV projectile energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy ion induced nuclear reactions are of interest to nuclear physics community since long time. In this paper, we have reported production cross sections of 196Au, 198Au, 199Tl, 200Tl, 201Tl, which might be direct reaction (DIR) products, obtained through the interaction of 108-171 MeV 20Ne on natural gold target. The radioisotopes were identified and were quantitatively measured by off-line gamma spectrometry. We have also used two different simulation codes PACE4 and FLUKA (version 4-3.3). PACE4 did not predicted production of 196Au and 198Au, might be because PACE4 does not considers direct reactions, but predicted 199Tl, 200Tl, 201Tl. FLUKA grossly underpredicted production of all these radionuclides.</description>

      <title>Imaging two-body correlations in atomic nuclei via low- and high-energy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the correlated behavior of nucleons inside atomic nuclei constitutes a long-standing challenge, both experimentally and theoretically. It has recently been understood that two-particle correlations in the azimuthal distribution of final hadrons emitted in ultra-relativistic ultra-central ion-ion collisions can be used to quantify ground-state two-body correlations. Performing systematic ab initio nuclear structure calculations of light nuclei, we demonstrate that such an observable does provide a meaningful imaging of nuclear ground states, naturally leading to a robust interpretation of the various categories of two-nucleon correlations at play. This is at variance with the low-energy approach relying on Kumar operators whose traditional interpretation in terms of deformation parameters is shown to be inoperative. A future interesting development will consist of targeting specific three-particle correlations to isolate three-nucleon correlations in which additional nuclear structure information of interest leave their fingerprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to model the evaporation residues produced by the interaction of 108-170 MeV of 20Ne with the 181Ta target using Monte-Carlo PACE4 simulation code. Reaction mechanisms taking place in these interactions along with production cross sections have been discussed. Possibility of the production of clinically important exotic neutron deficient radioisotopes from these interactions have been assessed, but the result is not encouraging for production of radioisotopes useful in nuclear medicine.</description>

      <title>The MUSE Target Chamber Post Veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) was developed to address the proton radius puzzle through simultaneous electron-proton and muon-proton scattering using the Paul Scherrer Institute's PiM1 secondary beamline. MUSE uses a large-solid-angle, non-magnetic spectrometer to detect beam particles scattering from a liquid hydrogen cell contained within a vacuum chamber. Due to the large scattering windows, the structural integrity of the chamber is supported by posts located at small scattering angles. While out of the acceptance, particles in the tails of the beam distribution can strike these posts, causing a significant trigger background. We describe the design and performance of the Target Chamber Post Veto (TCPV) detector installed inside the vacuum chamber to remove these background events at the trigger level.</description>

      <title>Improved linear Boltzmann transport model for hadron and jet suppression in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets serve as powerful tomographic probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the expanding landscape of jet observables reveals multi-faceted aspects of jet-medium interactions, a precise and simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and full jets still remains a challenge for theoretical models. In this work, we present two essential improvements to the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to bridge this gap. First, instead of implementing in-medium parton transport after vacuum parton showers complete, we introduce a medium scale at which the parton transport is inserted into the vacuum parton showers, providing a more physical picture of parton-QGP interactions. Second, we incorporate color flow information into the LBT model, enabling string connections between partons whose configurations are correlated with the medium-modified parton showers before hadronization. We demonstrate that both improvements alter the predicted ratio of hadron to jet quenching, leading to a satisfactory description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and jets with different flavors within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Application of a high-precision distributed uranium source for determining the effective mass and volume of a HPGe detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A distributed uranium source with the accurately certified activity of 238U has been used to verify the effective mass of the HPGe detector intended for the {\nu}GeN neutrino experiment. The source, dissolved in nitric acid, provides homogeneous irradiation of the detector crystal allowing the study of its mass and volume. The experimental spectra obtained with the distributed source have been compared to the detailed Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The measured counting rates of several gamma-lines agree with the simulated efficiencies, confirming that the detector mass and volume coincide with the manufacturer specifications. The results demonstrate the applicability of such sources for mass calibration of HPGe detectors.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Pseudoscalar Meson Structure from Light to Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the structure of pseudoscalar mesons within an algebraic model formulated in the light-front framework. The approach provides a unified description of leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), light-front wave functions (LFWFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs), charge radii, and impact-parameter GPDs (IPS-GPDs), all derived consistently from the same underlying Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Results are discussed for light ($\pi$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($\eta_c$, $\eta_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Strong potential in a box for applications to femtoscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the short-range nucleon-nucleon interaction is essential for the interpretation of correlation femtoscopy measurements in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions. We present an analytical treatment of the strong interaction in two-nucleon systems by modelling it with a square-well potential and solving the Schroedinger equation in the presence of the Coulomb interaction. The resulting pair wave function is regular at small relative distances and allows for the inclusion of multiple partial waves. We apply this framework to proton-proton femtoscopy and compute theoretical correlation functions for realistic source sizes. We demonstrate that the commonly used Lednicky-Lyuboshits asymptotic approximation overestimates the correlation signal for small sources. Comparisons with numerical calculations using the CATS framework and the Argonne v18 potential show good agreement within current experimental uncertainties. The proposed analytical approach provides a practical and flexible tool for femtoscopic analyses of nucleon and baryon pairs.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter via Invisible Decays in ${}^{46}$Sc Nuclear Gamma Cascades with a CsI(Tl) Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open problems in modern physics, motivating experimental searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Despite extensive efforts employing diverse detection strategies, large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. We report a high-statistics laboratory search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$-ray cascades using approximately $100~\mathrm{kg}$ of CsI(Tl) scintillators operated at Texas A\&amp;M University. The experiment employs a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source and a ``missing-$\gamma$'' technique, in which the absence of a photon from a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance-disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, enabling sensitivity to significantly weaker couplings. The setup provides simultaneous sensitivity to a broad class of light dark-sector candidates, including axions and axion-like particles, dark scalars, and dark photons in the $0.1 - 1 \text{ MeV}$ mass region. Through careful control of detector containment, energy resolution, and environmental backgrounds, we excludes certain regions on the previously explored parameter space. With foreseeable improvements in detector volume and systematic uncertainty control, this technique has the potential to probe currently unexplored parameter space for axion-like particles and light dark scalars.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Feed-down Hadrons in a Thermal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the potential impact of strong decays on the magnitude of fluctuations of net quantum numbers and integrals of balance functions based on a thermal hadron gas model. The calculations are based on a comprehensive list of known hadrons with masses up to 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ and include all decays of these hadrons with known branching fractions. The calculations are performed at vanishing baryo-chemical potential for temperatures between 140 and 200 MeV. We show that the decays feed-down substantially impact the single yield of measurable ``stable particles" as well as those of correlated densities of these species. Decays can then potentially have large and non-trivial impacts on measurements of net quantum number cumulants and balance functions. These observations are particularly important in the context of the search for the QCD critical point at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan as well as efforts to determine chemical susceptibilities near the phase transition at RHIC or LHC energies. Results obtained in this work also shed light on the importance of feed-down in measurements of balance functions in elementary p-p and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing $\alpha$ clustering in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at CSR energies using the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of low-energy nuclear collisions to intrinsic nuclear structure by studying the interplay between initial-state geometry and final-state observables in C+C and C+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.36$~GeV, relevant for experiments at the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) facility in Lanzhou and forthcoming experiments at the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) in Huizhou. Calculations are performed within the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM) using Woods--Saxon and triangular $\alpha$-clustered configurations for the $^{12}C$ nucleus. The initial geometry is characterized in terms of transverse size, compactness, eccentricities, and their ensemble-averaged fluctuations. We find that $\alpha$ clustering leads to a more compact participant configuration than the Woods--Saxon case, while transverse-size and eccentricity fluctuations show only weak sensitivity to clustering. At this beam energy, radial observables remain sensitive to geometric compactness, with the ensemble-averaged proton mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ enhanced for $\alpha$-clustered configurations, whereas pions show little sensitivity. The anisotropic response is examined using flow harmonic coefficients. We find an enhancement of the root-mean-square flow magnitudes, $v_n\{2\} = \sqrt{\langle v_n^2\rangle}$, for $\alpha$-clustered configurations at large $N_{part}$, while the ensemble-averaged fluctuation strength of individual harmonics remains small. Symmetric cumulants of the initial-state eccentricities show sensitivity to clustering, whereas the corresponding ensemble-averaged correlations among final-state flow harmonics do not exhibit a comparably strong separation. These results indicate that radial observables and correlation-based flow measurements provide complementary probes of $\alpha$ clustering in low-energy nuclear collisions.</description>
