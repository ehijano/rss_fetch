      <title>Ground state configurations of systems of interacting particles in one dimension under the potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on a 1985 paper by Nijboer and Ruijgrok, and prove results about ground state configurations under the potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$ at high densities (mean number of particles per unit volume) in one dimension. In particular, we show that for densities $\rho=\frac{n}{\sqrt{2}}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the configuration that places $n$ particles at each point of $\sqrt{2}\mathbb{Z}$ minimizes the average potential energy per particle.</description>

      <title>Model of the effective separable potential in the problem of three one-dimensional quantum particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to construct an effective model for studying the asymptotic solution of the scattering problem of three one-dimensional quantum particles with finite (short-range) attractive pair potentials. The asymptotic nature of the solution is defined by the rapid decrease in its discrepancy in the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Modes, Bounds, and Synthesis of Optimal Electromagnetic Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal synthesis of material distributions in obstacles for maximal extinction, scattering, or absorption. The material synthesis is based on an explicit construction utilizing the current distribution derived from physical bounds excited from the far-field. The bounds are expressed in radiation modes for materials restricted by their resistivity and characteristic modes for materials restricted by the contrast. The results are valid for arbitrary shapes, and analytical expressions are provided for spherical shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A contact problem of the theory of electroelasticity for piecewise-homogeneous plate of piezo-electric material with infinite cut and elastic finite inclusion of variable bending rigidity is considered. By using methods of the theory of analytic function, the problem is reduced to a system of singular integro-differential equation with fixed singularity. Using an integral transformation a Riemann problem is obtained, the solution of which is presented in explicit form.</description>

Abstract: We establish limiting absorption principles for contractions on a Hilbert space. Our sufficient conditions are based on positive commutator estimates. We discuss the dynamical implications of this principle to the corresponding discrete-time semigroup and provide several applications. Notably to Toeplitz operators and contractive quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Method of Filtration in first passage time problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistics of stochastic processes crucially depends on the imposed boundary condition. In one spatial dimension, for example, first passage time distribution in semi-infinite space (one absorbing boundary) is markedly different from that in a finite interval with two absorbing boundaries. Here we propose a method, which we call method of filtration, that allows us to construct the latter from the knowledge of the former only. We argue that our method is a sort of generalization of the method of image. We also demonstrate that in terms of the performance, it is complementary to another standard method based on the eigenfunction expansion solution of the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Simulation and design of isostatic thick origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thick origami structures are considered here as assemblies of polygonal panels hinged to each other along their edges according to a corresponding origami crease pattern. The determination of the internal actions caused by external loads in such structures is not an easy task, owing to their high degree of static indeterminacy, and the likelihood of unwanted self-balanced internal actions induced by manufacturing imperfections. Here we present a method for reducing the degree of static indeterminacy which can be applied to several thick origami structures to make them isostatic. The method utilizes sliding hinges, which permit also the relative translation along the hinge axis, to replace conventional hinges. After giving the analytical description of both types of hinges and describing a rigid folding simulation procedure based on the integration of the exponential map, we present the static analysis of a series of noteworthy examples based on the Miura-ori pattern, the Yoshimura pattern, and the Kresling pattern. The method can be applied for the design and realization of thick origami structures with adequate strength to resist external actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pathway model for the real scalar variable case is re-explored and its connections to fractional integrals, solutions of fractional differential equations, Tsallis statistics and superstatistics in statistical mechanics, reaction-rate probability integral, Kraetzel transform, and pathway transform are explored. It is shown that the common thread in these connections is the H-function representations. The pathway parameter is shown to be connected to the fractional order in fractional integrals and fractional differential equations.</description>

      <title>Boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous analysis on boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on Lipschitz polyhedra. The magnetic field integral equation is widely used in practical applications to model electromagnetic scattering by a perfectly conducting body. The governing operator is shown to be coercive by means of the electric field integral operator with a purely imaginary wave number. Consequently, the continuous variational problem is uniquely solvable, given that the wave number does not belong to the spectrum of the interior Maxwell's problem. A Galerkin discretization scheme is then introduced, employing Raviart-Thomas basis functions for the solution space and Buffa-Christiansen functions for the test space. A discrete inf-sup condition is proven, implying the unique solvability of the discrete variational problem. An asymptotically quasi-optimal error estimate for the numerical solutions is established, and the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is examined. In addition, the resulting matrix system is shown to be well-conditioned regardless of the mesh refinement. Some numerical results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order asymptotic observables are quasi-isomorphic to time-ordered amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic observables in quantum field theory beyond the familiar $S$-matrix have recently attracted much interest, for instance in the context of gravity waveforms. Such observables can be understood in terms of Schwinger-Keldysh-type 'amplitudes' computed by a set of modified Feynman rules involving cut internal legs and external legs labelled by time-folds.
  In parallel, a homotopy-algebraic understanding of perturbative quantum field theory has emerged in recent years. In particular, passing through homotopy transfer, the $S$-matrix of a perturbative quantum field theory can be understood as the minimal model of an associated (quantum) $L_\infty$-algebra.
  Here we bring these two developments together. In particular, we show that Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes are naturally encoded in an $L_\infty$-algebra, similar to ordinary scattering amplitudes. As before, they are computed via homotopy transfer, but using deformation-retract data that are not canonical (in contrast to the conventional $S$-matrix). We further show that the $L_\infty$-algebras encoding Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes and ordinary amplitudes are quasi-isomorphic (meaning, in a suitable sense, equivalent). This entails a set of recursion relations that enable one to compute Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes in terms of ordinary amplitudes or vice versa.</description>

Abstract: The paper studies the existence of periodic solutions of a perturbed relativistic Kepler problem of the type \begin{equation*} \dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\frac{m\dot{x}}{\sqrt{1-|\dot{x}|^{2}/c^{2}}}\right) = -\alpha\frac{x}{|x|^{3}} + \varepsilon \, \nabla_{x} U(t,x), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}, \end{equation*} with $d=2$ or $d=3$, bifurcating, for $\varepsilon$ small enough, from the set of circular solutions of the unperturbed system. Both the case of the fixed-period problem (assuming that $U$ is $T$-periodic in time) and the case of the fixed-energy problem (assuming that $U$ is independent of time) are considered.</description>

      <title>New Uncertainty Principle for a particle on a Torus Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work deals with quantum Uncertainty Relations (UR) subjected to the Standard Deviations (SD) of the relevant dynamical variables for a particle constrained to move on a torus knot. It is important to note that these variables have to obey the two distinct periodicities of the knotted paths embedded on the torus. We compute generalized forms of the SDs and the subsequent URs (following the Kennard-Robertson formalism). These quantities explicitly involve the torus parameters and the knot parameters where restrictions on the latter have to be taken into account. These induce restrictions on the possible form of wave functions that are used to calculate the SDs and URs and in our simple example, two distinct SDs and URs are possible. In a certain limit (thin torus limit), our results will reduce to the results for a particle moving in a circle.
  An interesting fact emerges that in the case of the SDs and URs, the local geometry of the knots plays the decisive role and not their topological properties.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Cantor potential of minimum lacunarity: Special case of super periodic generalized unified Cantor potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the fractal and non-fractal potentials we propose a new generalised version of unified Cantor potential (GUCP), where $\frac{1}{\rho^{\mu+\nu G}}\ \ \ (\mu,\ \nu $ are real numbers) portion of the potential is removed and is characterised by a integer N which represents the potential count at the stage $S=1$. Notably, the polyadic Cantor potential (PCP) with minimal lacunarity is a specific instance within the GUCP paradigm. Employing the super periodic potential (SPP) formalism, we calculate a closed-form expression for transmission probability $T_{S}(k, N)$ using the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. We further show that GUCP system exhibits sharp transmission resonances, differing from traditional quantum systems. Our analysis reveals saturation in the transmission profile with evolving stages $S$ and establishes a significant scaling relationship between reflection probability and wave-vector ($k$) through analytical derivations.</description>

Abstract: Performing both right and left multiplication operations using general regular matrix polynomials, which need not be monic and may possess leading coefficients of arbitrary rank, on a rectangular matrix of measures associated with mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials, reveals corresponding Christoffel formulas. These formulas express the perturbed mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials in relation to the original ones. Utilizing the divisibility theorem for matrix polynomials, we establish a criterion for the existence of perturbed orthogonality, expressed through the non-cancellation of certain $\tau$ determinants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that random walks on a family of tilings of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with a canonical choice of conductances, converge to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This class of tilings includes Delaunay triangulations (the dual of Voronoi tesselations) and sphere packings. Our regularity assumptions are deterministic and mild. For example, our results apply to Delaunay triangulations with vertices sampled from a d-dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. As part of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence of certain finite volume schemes for the Laplace equation, with quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. In the special case of two dimensions, we give a new, short proof of the main result of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give partial affirmative answers to Landis conjecture in all dimensions for two different types of linear, second order, elliptic operators in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we provide a sharp decay criterion that ensures when a solution of a nonnegative Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a potential $V\leq 1$ is trivial. Moreover, we address the analogue of Landis conjecture for quasilinear problems. Our approach relies on the application of Liouville comparison principles and criticality theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone.</description>

Abstract: We construct the generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions through $W$ representations, where the expansions are respectively with respect to the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials labeled by $N$-tuple of Young diagrams. We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the $4d$ and $5d$ Nekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed $W$-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface.

      <title>Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Laplacian with the homogeneous magnetic field in two and three dimensions. We prove that the $(k+1)$-th magnetic Neumann eigenvalue of a bounded convex planar domain is not larger than its $k$-th magnetic Dirichlet eigenvalue. In three dimensions, we restrict our attention to convex domains, which are invariant under rotation by an angle of $\pi$ around an axis parallel to the magnetic field. For such domains, we prove that the $(k+2)$-th magnetic Neumann eigenvalue is not larger than the $k$-th magnetic Dirichlet eigenvalue provided that this Dirichlet eigenvalue is simple. The proofs rely on a modification of the strategy due to Levine and Weinberger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define three families of quivers in which the braid relations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are realized by mutations and automorphisms. A sequence of eight braid moves on a reduced word for the longest element of $S_4$ yields three trivial cluster transformations with 8, 32 and 32 mutations. For each of these cluster transformations, a unitary operator representing a single braid move in a quantum mechanical system solves the tetrahedron equation. The solutions thus obtained are constructed from the noncompact quantum dilogarithm and can be identified with the partition functions of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on a squashed three-sphere.</description>

      <title>Complex fluid models of mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several methods in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics are based on Madelung's hydrodynamic description of nuclear motion, while the electronic component is treated as a finite-dimensional quantum system. In this context, the quantum potential leads to severe computational challenges and one often seeks to neglect its contribution, thereby approximating nuclear motion as classical. The resulting model couples classical hydrodynamics for the nuclei to the quantum motion of the electronic component, leading to the structure of a complex fluid system. This type of mixed quantum-classical fluid models have also appeared in solvation dynamics to describe the coupling between liquid solvents and the quantum solute molecule. While these approaches represent a promising direction, their mathematical structure requires a certain care. In some cases, challenging higher-order gradients make these equations hardly tractable. In other cases, these models are based on phase-space formulations that suffer from well-known consistency issues. Here, we present a new complex fluid system that resolves these difficulties. Unlike common approaches, the current system is obtained by applying the fluid closure at the level of the action principle of the original phase-space model. As a result, the system inherits a Hamiltonian structure and retains energy/momentum balance. After discussing some of its structural properties and dynamical invariants, we illustrate the model in the case of pure-dephasing dynamics. We conclude by presenting some invariant planar models.</description>

Abstract: We study the real hyperelliptic solutions of the focusing modified KdV (MKdV) equation of the genus three. Since the complex hyperelliptic solutions of the focusing MKdV equation over $\mathbb{C}$ are associated with the real gauged MKdV equation, we present a novel construction of the real hyperelliptic solutions of the gauged MKdV equation. When the gauge field is constant, it can be regarded as the real solution of the focusing MKdV equation, and thus we also discuss the behavior of the gauge field numerically.</description>

Abstract: We consider ground states of the $N$ coupled fermionic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger systems with the Coulomb potential $V(x)$ in the $L^2$-subcritical case. By studying the associated constraint variational problem, we prove the existence of ground states for the system with any parameter $\alpha&gt;0$, which represents the attractive strength of the non-relativistic quantum particles. The limiting behavior of ground states for the system is also analyzed as $\alpha\to\infty$, where the mass concentrates at one of the singular points for the Coulomb potential $V(x)$.</description>

Abstract: Chynoweth and Sewell proposed a mathematical model for an atmospheric front based on the singularities of the Legendre transformation between different pairs of dual variables. Drawing inspiration from their work, we formalize the idea of a Chynoweth-Sewell front and illuminate its geometrical meaning from the viewpoint of Monge-Ampere geometry. This extends our previous work on the semigeostrophic model to dynamically-forming singularities. We use the notion of a Chynoweth-Sewell front to characterize the classical Eady problem and its known solutions in geometrical terms.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Gaussian free field sign clusters and random interlacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.05970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a large class of amenable transient weighted graphs $G$, we prove that the sign clusters of the Gaussian free field on $G$ fall into a regime of strong supercriticality, in which two infinite sign clusters dominate (one for each sign), and finite sign clusters are necessarily tiny, with overwhelming probability. Examples of graphs belonging to this class include regular lattices like $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d \geqslant 3$, but also more intricate geometries, such as Cayley graphs of suitably growing (finitely generated) non-Abelian groups, and cases in which random walks exhibit anomalous diffusive behavior, for instance various fractal graphs. As a consequence, we also show that the vacant set of random interlacements on these objects, introduced by Sznitman in arXiv:0704.2560, and which is intimately linked to the free field, contains an infinite connected component at small intensities. In particular, this result settles an open problem from arXiv:1010.1490.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on any quasi-conical open set coincides with the non-negative semi-axis. We show that there is a connected quasi-conical open set such that the respective Dirichlet Laplacian has a positive (embedded) eigenvalue. This open set is constructed as the tower of cubes of growing size connected by windows of vanishing size. Moreover, we show that the sizes of the windows in this construction can be chosen so that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian is empty.</description>

Abstract: The parametric representation has been used since a long time for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. As a dimension independent intermediate representation, it allows a clear description of singularities. Recently, it has become a choice tool for the investigation of the type of transcendent numbers appearing in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. The inclusion of numerators has however stagnated since the ground work of Nakanishi. I here show how to greatly simplify the formulas through the use of Dodgson identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic (AP-) and asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies negative and bounded conditions on Ricci curvature tensor. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of AP- and AAP- mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the ones for Navier-Stokes equations obtained in \cite{Xuan2022}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory that allows to quantify entanglement and investigate its properties, for example its monogamy over multipartite systems. Here, we derive variational formulas for relative entropies based on restricted measurements of multipartite quantum systems. By combining these with multivariate matrix trace inequalities, we recover and sometimes strengthen various existing entanglement monogamy inequalities. In particular, we give direct, matrix-analysis-based proofs for the faithfulness of squashed entanglement by relating it to the relative entropy of entanglement measured with one-way local operations and classical communication, as well as for the faithfulness of conditional entanglement of mutual information by relating it to the separably measured relative entropy of entanglement. We discuss variations of these results using the relative entropy to states with positive partial transpose, and multipartite setups. Our results simplify and generalize previous derivations in the literature that employed operational arguments about the asymptotic achievability of information-theoretic tasks.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

      <title>Modeling the performance and bandwidth of single-atom adiabatic quantum memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential for quantum repeaters that will form the backbone of the future quantum internet. Such memory can capture a signal state for a controllable amount of time after which this state can be retrieved. In this work, we theoretically investigated how atomic material and engineering parameters affect the performance and bandwidth of a quantum memory. We have applied a theoretical model for quantum memory operation based on the Lindblad master equation and adiabatic quantum state manipulation. The materials properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories by showcasing two defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We have derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general and independent of materials, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable three-level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories. Our work is therefore an important step toward the realization of a large-scale quantum network.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

Abstract: Rigorous derivations of the approach of individual elements of large isolated systems to a state of thermal equilibrium, starting from arbitrary initial states, are exceedingly rare. This is particularly true for quantum mechanical systems. We demonstrate here how, through a mechanism of repeated scattering, an approach to equilibrium of this type actually occurs in a specific quantum system, one that can be viewed as a natural quantum analog of several previously studied classical models. In particular, we consider an optical mode passing through a reservoir composed of a large number of sequentially-encountered modes of the same frequency, each of which it interacts with through a beam splitter. We then analyze the dependence of the asymptotic state of this mode on the assumed stationary common initial state $\sigma$ of the reservoir modes and on the transmittance $\tau=\cos\lambda$ of the beam splitters. These results allow us to establish that at small $\lambda$ such a mode will, starting from an arbitrary initial system state $\rho$, approach a state of thermal equilibrium even when the reservoir modes are not themselves initially thermalized. We show in addition that, when the initial states are pure, the asymptotic state of the optical mode is maximally entangled with the reservoir and exhibits less nonclassicality than the state of the reservoir modes.</description>

      <title>Rhombic staircase tableaux and Koornwinder polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we give a combinatorial formula for a certain class of Koornwinder polynomials, also known as Macdonald polynomials of type $\tilde{C}$. In particular, we give a combinatorial formula for the Koornwinder polynomials $K_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}(z_1,\dots,z_N; a,b,c,d; q,t)$, where $\lambda = (1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)$. We also give combinatorial formulas for all ``open boundary ASEP polynomials'' $F_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a composition in $\{-1,0,1\}^N$; these polynomials are related to the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials $E_{\mu}$ up to a triangular change of basis. Our formulas are in terms of rhombic staircase tableaux, certain tableaux that we introduced in previous work to give a formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a line with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotically Almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Quantum Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the principles of the ETH - Approach to Quantum Mechanics we study fluorescence and the phenomenon of ``quantum jumps'' in idealized models of atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-WLZZ models from $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>

      <title>A $\Gamma$-convergence of level-two large deviation for metastable systems: The case of zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between the precise asymptotics of the level-two large deviation rate function and the behavior of metastable stochastic systems. Initially identified for overdamped Langevin dynamics (Ges{\`u} et al., SIAM J Math Anal 49(4), 3048-3072, 2017), this connection has been validated across various models, including random walks in a potential field. We extend this connection to condensing zero-range processes, a complex interacting particle system.
  Specifically, we investigate a certain class of zero-range processes on a fixed graph $G$ with $N &gt; 0$ particles and interaction parameter $\alpha &gt; 1$. On the time scale $N^2$, this process behaves like an absorbing-type diffusion and converges to a condensed state where all particles occupy a single vertex of $G$ as $N$ approaches infinity. Once condensed, on the time scale $N^{1+\alpha}$, the condensed site moves according to a Markov chain on $G$, showing metastable behavior among condensed states. The time scales $N^2$ and $N^{1+\alpha}$ are called the pre-metastable and metastable time scales. It is conjectured that this behavior is encapsulated in the level-two large deviation rate function $\mathcal{I}_N$ of the zero-range process. Specifically, it is expected that the $\Gamma$-expansion of $\mathcal{I}_N$ can be expressed as:$$\mathcal{I}_N = \frac{1}{N^2} \mathcal{K} + \frac{1}{N^{1+\alpha}} \mathcal{J},$$ where $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are the level-two large deviation rate functions of the absorbing diffusion processes and the Markov chain on $G$. We rigorously prove this $\Gamma$-expansion by developing a methodology for $\Gamma$-convergence in the pre-metastable time scale and establishing a link between the resolvent approach to metastability (Landim et al., J Eur Math Soc, 2023. arXiv:2102.00998) and the $\Gamma$-expansion in the metastable time scale.</description>
