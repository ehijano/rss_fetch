      <title>Ionic self-phoresis maps onto correlation-induced self-phoresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the self-phoresis of a particle that releases(removes) pairs of ions into(from) the electrolyte solution. We show analytically that in the linear regime the mathematical description of this system maps onto that of the correlation-induced (self-)chemophoresis (CICP). This connection provides a unifying perspective of the two phenomena, within which one recovers and extends recent predictions as particular instances of CICP. Conversely, ion-phoretic particles are identified as candidates for experimental investigations into the rich variety of motility patterns predicted by CICP.</description>

      <title>AMEP: The Active Matter Evaluation Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a Python library for analyzing simulation data of particle-based and continuum simulations. It provides a powerful and simple interface for handling large data sets and for calculating and visualizing a broad variety of observables that are relevant to active matter systems. Examples range from the mean-square displacement and the structure factor to cluster-size distributions, binder cumulants, and growth exponents. AMEP is written in pure Python and is based on powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Computationally expensive methods are parallelized and optimized to run efficiently on workstations, laptops, and high-performance computing architectures, and an HDF5-based data format is used in the backend to store and handle simulation data as well as analysis results. AMEP provides the first comprehensive framework for analyzing simulation results of both particle-based and continuum simulations (as well as experimental data) of active matter systems. In particular, AMEP also allows it to analyze simulations that combine particle-based and continuum techniques such as used to study the motion of bacteria in chemical fields or for modeling particle motion in a flow field. AMEP is available at https://amepproject.de and can be installed via conda and pip.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanocrystal superlattice self-assembly near a metastable liquid binodal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>K-core attack, equilibrium K-core, and kinetically constrained spin system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin systems are toy models of supercooled liquids and amorphous solids. In this Perspective, we revisit the prototypical Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) kinetically constrained model from the viewpoint of K-core combinatorial optimization. Each kinetic cluster of the FA system, containing all the mutually visitable microscopic occupation configurations, is exactly the solution space of a specific instance of the K-core attack problem. The whole set of different jammed occupation patterns of the FA system is the configuration space of an equilibrium K-core problem. Based on recent theoretical results achieved on the K-core attack and equilibrium K-core problems, we discuss the thermodynamic spin glass phase transitions and the maximum occupation density of the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster, and the minimum occupation density and extreme vulnerability of the partially frozen (jammed) kinetic clusters. The equivalence between K-core attack and the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster also implies a new way of sampling K-core attack solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces SwarmRL, a Python package designed to study intelligent active particles. SwarmRL provides an easy-to-use interface for developing models to control microscopic colloids using classical control and deep reinforcement learning approaches. These models may be deployed in simulations or real-world environments under a common framework. We explain the structure of the software and its key features and demonstrate how it can be used to accelerate research. With SwarmRL, we aim to streamline research into micro-robotic control while bridging the gap between experimental and simulation-driven sciences. SwarmRL is available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/SwarmRL/SwarmRL.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of a hanging string with a freely pivoting attached mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the natural resonant frequency of a suspended flexible string is significantly modified (by one order of magnitude) by adding a freely pivoting attached mass at its lower end. This articulated system then exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics such as bending oscillations, similar to those of a swing becoming slack, thereby strongly modifying the system resonance that is found to be controlled by the length of the pivoting mass. The dynamics is experimentally studied using a remote and noninvasive magnetic parametric forcing. To do so, a permanent magnet is suspended by a flexible string above a vertically oscillating conductive plate. Harmonic and period-doubling instabilities are experimentally reported and are modeled using the Hill equation, leading to analytical solutions that accurately describe the experimentally observed tonguelike instability curves.</description>

      <title>Freezing density scaling of transport coefficients in the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity) of the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) fluid along isotherms exhibit a freezing density scaling (FDS). The functional form of this FDS is essentially the same or closely related to those in the Lennard-Jones fluid, hard-sphere fluid, and some liquefied noble gases. This proves that this FDS represents a quasi-universal corresponding state principle for simple classical fluids with steep interactions. Some related aspects such as Stokes-Einstein relation without a hydrodynamic diameter and gas-to-liquid dynamical crossover are briefly discussed. Simple fitting formula for the transport coefficients of the dense WCA fluid are suggested.</description>

      <title>Model-free inference of memory in conformational dynamics of a multi-domain protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule experiments provide insight into the motion (conformational dynamics) of individual protein molecules. Usually, a well-defined but coarse-grained intramolecular coordinate is measured and subsequently analysed with the help of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deduce the kinetics of protein conformational changes. Such approaches rely on the assumption that the microscopic dynamics of the protein evolve according to a Markov-jump process on some network. However, the manifestation and extent of memory in the dynamics of the observable strongly depends on the chosen underlying Markov model, which is generally not known and therefore can lead to misinterpretations. Here, we combine extensive single-molecule plasmon ruler experiments on the heat shock protein Hsp90, computer simulations, and theory to infer and quantify memory in a model-free fashion. Our analysis is based on the bare definition of non-Markovian behaviour and does not require any underlying model. In the case of Hsp90 probed by a plasmon ruler, the Markov assumption is found to be clearly and conclusively violated on timescales up to roughly 50 s, which corresponds roughly to $\sim$50% of the inferred correlation time of the signal. The extent of memory is striking and reaches biologically relevant timescales. This implies that memory effects penetrate even the slowest observed motions. We provide clear and reproducible guidelines on how to test for the presence and duration of memory in experimental single-molecule data.</description>

      <title>Ordered and disordered stealthy hyperuniform point patterns across spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work [Phys. Rev. X 5, 021020 (2015)], it was shown that stealthy hyperuniform systems can be regarded as hard spheres in Fourier-space in the sense that the the structure factor is exactly zero in a spherical region around the origin in analogy with the pair-correlation function of real-space hard spheres. In this work, we exploit this correspondence to confirm that the densest Fourier-space hard-sphere system is that of a Bravais lattice. This is in contrast to real-space hard-spheres, whose densest configuration is conjectured to be disordered. We also extend the virial series previously suggested for disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems to higher dimensions in order to predict spatial decorrelation as function of dimension. This prediction is then borne out by numerical simulations of disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground states in dimensions $d=2$-$8$.</description>

      <title>Brain-inspired computing with fluidic iontronic nanochannels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain's remarkable and efficient information processing capability is driving research into brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computing paradigms. Artificial aqueous ion channels are emerging as an exciting platform for neuromorphic computing, representing a departure from conventional solid-state devices by directly mimicking the brain's fluidic ion transport. Supported by a quantitative theoretical model, we present easy to fabricate tapered microchannels that embed a conducting network of fluidic nanochannels between a colloidal structure. Due to transient salt concentration polarisation our devices are volatile memristors (memory resistors) that are remarkably stable. The voltage-driven net salt flux and accumulation, that underpin the concentration polarisation, surprisingly combine into a diffusionlike quadratic dependence of the memory retention time on the channel length, allowing channel design for a specific timescale. We implement our device as a synaptic element for neuromorphic reservoir computing. Individual channels distinguish various time series, that together represent (handwritten) numbers, for subsequent in-silico classification with a simple readout function. Our results represent a significant step towards realising the promise of fluidic ion channels as a platform to emulate the rich aqueous dynamics of the brain.</description>

      <title>Floating active carpets drive transport and aggregation in aquatic ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communities of swimming microorganisms often thrive near liquid-air interfaces. We study how such `active carpets' shape their aquatic environment by driving biogenic transport in the water column beneath them. The hydrodynamic stirring that active carpets generate leads to diffusive upward fluxes of nutrients from deeper water layers, and downward fluxes of oxygen and carbon. Combining analytical theory and simulations, we examine the biogenic transport by studying fundamental metrics, including the single and pair diffusivity, the first passage time for particle pair encounters, and the rate of particle aggregation. Our findings reveal that the hydrodynamic fluctuations driven by active carpets have a region of influence that reaches orders of magnitude further in distance than the size of the organisms. These nonequilibrium fluctuations lead to a strongly enhanced diffusion of particles, which is anisotropic and space-dependent. Fluctuations also facilitate encounters of particle pairs, which we quantify by analysing their velocity pair correlation functions as a function of distance between the particles. We found that the size of the particles plays a crucial role in their encounter rates, with larger particles situated near the active carpet being more favourable for aggregation. Overall, this research broadens our comprehension of aquatic systems out of equilibrium and how biologically driven fluctuations contribute to the transport of fundamental elements in biogeochemical cycles.</description>

      <title>Mpemba meets Newton: Exploring the Mpemba and Kovacs effects in the time-delayed cooling law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research, the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the Mpemba effect, a phenomenon where a substance cools faster after initially being heated, remain elusive. Although historically linked with water, the Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a time delay ($\tau$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time ($t_{\text{w}}$). Remarkably, the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional ($\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$), with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect or the relative strength of the Kovacs effect. The findings enhance our understanding of these memory phenomena, providing valuable insights applicable to researchers across diverse fields, ranging from physics to materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a universal characterization of stress correlations in athermal systems, across crystalline to amorphous packings. Via numerical analysis of static configurations of particles interacting through harmonic as well as Lennard-Jones potentials, for a variety of preparation protocols and ranges of microscopic disorder, we show that the properties of the stress correlations at large lengthscales are surprisingly universal across all situations, independent of structural correlations, or the correlations in orientational order. In the near-crystalline limit, we present exact results for the stress correlations for both models, which work surprisingly well at large lengthscales, even in the amorphous phase. Finally, we study the differences in stress fluctuations across the amorphization transition, where stress correlations reveal the loss of periodicity in the structure at short lengthscales with increasing disorder.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics and entropy production of a trapped colloidal particle in a complex nonreciprocal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the two-dimensional motion of a Brownian particle that is confined to a harmonic trap and driven by a shear flow. The surrounding medium induces memory effects modelled by a linear, typically nonreciprocal coupling of the particle coordinates to an auxiliary (hidden) variable. The system's behavior resulting from the microscopic Langevin equations for the three variables is analyzed by means of exact moment equations derived from the Fokker-Planck representation, and numerical Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations. Increasing the shear rate beyond a critical value we observe, for suitable coupling scenarios with nonreciprocal elements, a transition from a stationary to an instationary state, corresponding to an escape from the trap. We analyze this behavior, analytically and numerically, in terms of the associated moments of the probability distribution, and from the perspective of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Intriguingly, the entropy production rate remains finite when crossing the stability threshold.</description>
