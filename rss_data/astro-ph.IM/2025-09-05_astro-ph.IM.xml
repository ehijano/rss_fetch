      <title>Seeing and Meteorological Analysis at the North-1 and North-2 Points of Muztagh-Ata Site on the Pamir Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support the selection of large optical/infrared telescope sites in western China, long-term monitoring of atmospheric conditions and astronomical seeing has been conducted at the Muztagh-Ata site on the Pamir Plateau since 2017. With the monitoring focus gradually shifting northward, three stations were established: the South Point, North-1 point, and North-2 point. The North-1 point,selected as the site for the 1.93m Muztagh Optical Survey Telescope (MOST), has recorded seeing and meteorological parameters since late 2018. In 2023,the North-2 point was established approximately 1.5 km northeast of North-1 point as a candidate location for a future large-aperture telescope. A 10m DIMM tower and a PC-4A environmental monitoring system were installed to evaluate site quality. This study presents a comparative analysis of data from the North-1 and North-2 points during 2018-2024.The median seeing is 0.89 arcsecs at North-1 and 0.78 arcsecs at North-2. Both points show clear seasonal and diurnal variations,with winter nights offering optimal observing conditions.On average, about 64% of the nighttime duration per year is suitable for astronomical observations. Nighttime temperature variation is low :2.03 at North-1 and 2.10 at North-2 .Median wind speeds are 5-6 m/s, with dominant directions between 210 and 300, contributing to stable airflow. Moderate wind suppresses turbulence, while strong shear and rapid fluctuations degrade image quality. These findings confirm that both the North-1 and North-2 points offer high-quality atmospheric conditions and serve as promising sites for future ground-based optical/infrared telescopes in western China.</description>

      <title>Systematic effect induced by misalignment in a Reflective Polarization Modulator for CMB, and application to the LiteBIRD case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] The LiteBIRD mission aims to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented precision, targeting the detection of primordial B modes and a precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. A central component of LiteBIRD are the polarization modulators based on Half-Wave Plates (HWP). In this work, we investigate systematic effects caused by a small, constant misalignment between the reflective HWP's rotation axis and optical axis, which mimics a wedge-like effect. This effect can introduce HWP-synchronous pointing errors, biasing polarization measurements and generating spurious B modes. Using the LiteBIRD simulation framework, we implement this wedge-like misalignment in time-ordered data and evaluate its impact on reconstructed maps and angular power spectra. Our results show that the contamination predominantly mimics lensing B modes rather than primordial tensor modes, and its impact is reduced when increasing the number of detectors. By estimating the resulting error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we set constraints on the maximum allowable wedge angle to ensure systematic effects remain below mission requirements. This study emphasizes the critical importance of precise optical alignment in CMB polarization experiments. Future work will address the additional effects of time-dependent HWP wobbling and more realistic scenarios with non-ideal detector pairs.</description>

      <title>The Santa Cruz Extreme AO Lab (SEAL) 2.0: A reflective, multi-wavelength rebuild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Santa cruz Extreme Adaptive optics Lab (SEAL) is a visible/near-infrared wavelength testbed designed to support technology development for high contrast imaging on large, segmented, ground-based telescopes. SEAL saw first light in 2021 as a transmissive, visible-wavelength AO testbed. In this paper, we present four major upgrades to SEAL: (1) the testbed has been rebuilt with custom off-axis parabolic mirrors, enabling operation in both near-infrared and visible wavelengths; (2) the suite of wavefront sensors now includes a Shack-Hartmann, transmissive four-sided pyramid, vector-Zernike, and, in the muirSEAL testbed, a photonic lantern; (3) the testbed includes a vector-vortex coronagraph and will soon include a hybrid astrophotonic coronagraph; (4) in addition to its original Keck-heritage RTC, SEAL now includes two additional control software packages: Catkit, originally developed for the HiCAT testbed at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and the RTC Compute And Control for Adaptive Optics (CACAO), originally designed for Subaru/SCExAO. We discuss the performance of the testbed after the reflective rebuild and on-going technology development work at SEAL.</description>

      <title>PANDORA: New avenues in sub-percent photometric precision for ground based astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision photometric calibration is key to a number of astrophysical research areas such as supernova cosmology and dark energy studies. In the age of large surveys, pushing the limits of photometry is a worthy challenge, with traditional celestial calibrators limited to approximately percent precision. Here we present PANDORA, a novel calibration source that achieves sub-percent photometric precision across the optical spectrum with a selectable dynamic range and high optical efficiency. Building on proven collimated beam projector designs for relative throughput calibration of survey telescopes, PANDORA is capable of delivering photons anywhere in the 350-1100 nm spectral range. It uses selectable neutral density filters and sequential NIST-calibrated photodiode feedback to internally self-calibrate prior to operation, and is illuminated by an Energetiq EQ-99X-FC broadband laser-driven light source. We present here an overview of the system design, operation, and laboratory characterization results. PANDORA will begin science operations this year to support the upcoming LS4 survey on the ESO 1m Schmidt telescope.</description>

      <title>Single-shot focal plane wavefront sensing with the spatially-clipped self-coherent camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory requires active speckle suppression to directly image Earth-like exoplanets. Focal plane wavefront sensing and control allows us to detect, and subsequently remove, time-varying speckles through measurements of the electric field. Two measurement-based wavefront sensing approaches are pairwise probing (PWP) and the self-coherent camera (SCC). However, the PWP technique is time-consuming, requiring at least 4 images and reducing the speed at which aberrations can be eliminated. In the SCC, a coronagraph mask diffracts light outside of the Lyot stop, where it is filtered with a pinhole. The filtered light creates a reference beam, interfering with speckles that leak through the coronagraph. The classic implementation of the SCC only works over small spectral bandwidths and needs significantly oversized optics which limits its implementation. We propose a new variant, the Spatially-Clipped Self-Coherent Camera (SCSCC). The SCSCC utilizes a pinhole placed closer to the Lyot Stop, reducing the overall beam footprint and boosting the sensor resolution. A knife-edge beam splitter downstream of the Lyot Stop splits the light into two channels: fringed and unfringed. This allows us to sense the wavefront with a single exposure. Time-varying aberrations are effectively frozen in place, making them easy to remove. We present monochromatic simulation results of the SCSCC in a sensing and control loop, demonstrating a normalized intensity of ~ 4 * 10^-10 in a 5-20 lambda/D dark hole. We find that wavefront control paired with the SCSCC achieves ~ 50x deeper contrast than that achieved with PWP in a temporally evolving speckle field. Our results make the SCSCC a valuable wavefront sensor concept for the upcoming Habitable World Observatory mission.</description>

      <title>Development of Solar Flare X-ray Polarimeter with Micro-Pixel CMOS Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are developing an X-ray polarimeter using micro-pixel CMOS sensors for solar flare X-ray polarimetry. The system consists of a 2.5-$\mu$m pixel CMOS image sensor with a 12.8$\times$12.8 mm$^2$ imaging area and a readout system based on a Zynq System-on-Chip. While previous studies have validated this concept, no realistic feasibility studies have been conducted for the solar flare X-ray polarization observation. In this work, we performed polarization sensitivity measurements at synchrotron facilities. The results show that our polarimeter is sensitive to the X-ray polarization, exhibiting a modulation factor of 5-15% at an energy range of 6-22 keV. The measurements also determined the thickness of the sensitive layer to be approximately 5 $\mu$m, and the thicknesses of the insensitive layers to be 0.8 $\mu$m (Si), 2.1 $\mu$m (SiO2), and 0.24 $\mu$m (Cu). These measured thicknesses lead to a quantum efficiency of 3-4% at 10 keV. Based on these experimental evaluations, we estimated the sensitivity of the micro-pixel CMOS polarimeter system. We found that, when combined with a telescope with an effective area of $\sim$10 cm$^2$, this system can detect X-ray polarization with a polarization degree of a few percent for M-class flares.</description>

      <title>Simulating the propagation of cosmic rays heavier than iron in SimProp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have long been assumed to entirely consist of iron and/or lighter atomic nuclei, and this assumption has been hard-coded in a great deal of software for UHECR simulations and data analysis. However, in the last few years several authors have started questioning this assumption and entertaining the possibility that UHECRs might at least partly consist of nuclei of elements heavier than iron, especially at the highest energies. Thoroughly testing this hypothesis will require upgrading software so that it can handle such nuclei. In this contribution I will describe the minimal modifications required for the last publicly released version of SimProp, a code for Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic propagation of UHECRs, to be able to treat heavier nuclei, and discuss the applicability of approximations first introduced for lighter nuclei.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning to Identify Artificial Satellite Trails in Multi-band Photometric Astronomical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research addresses the growing challenge of artificial satellite trail interference in ground-based astronomical observations by developing an efficient deep learning identification method. With the proliferation of satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, accurate detection of satellite trails has become crucial for preserving astronomical data quality. Using multi-band photometric survey observational data from the $Multi-channel$ $Photometric$ $Survey$ $Telescope$ (Mephisto) of Yunnan University , we constructed a specialized dataset of astronomical images containing satellite trails. We propose a novel ASA-U-Net model that integrates atrous spatial pyramid pooling with channel attention mechanisms into the U-Net architecture to effectively capture sparse satellite trail features that traditional semantic segmentation models often miss during downsampling. The model was implemented and validated on actual telescope data, demonstrating superior performance in end-to-end detection and marking of satellite trails compared to traditional methods. This approach significantly improves data processing precision without requiring manual parameter adjustments, making it suitable for processing massive nightly survey data and enhancing the quality of astronomical data products.</description>

      <title>POEMMA-Balloon with Radio: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an Ultra Long Duration Balloon payload scheduled for launch in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. It will circle over the Southern Ocean for a mission duration as long as 50 days, serving as a precursor to the dual satellite mission, Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The PBR mission represents a significant step towards establishing a space-based multi-messenger observatory. Observations from space will enhance the statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and complement ground-based observatories by enabling simultaneous observations of both hemispheres with a single instrument. Additionally, POEMMA will facilitate the measurement of Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs) following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. PBR is an adaptation of the POEMMA mission, featuring three primary science goals: 1. Observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) via the fluorescence technique from suborbital space. 2. Observe horizontal high-altitude air showers (HAHAs) with energies exceeding the cosmic ray knee (E &gt; 3 PeV) using optical and radio detection for the first time. 3. Follow astrophysical event alerts in the search for VHENs. This contribution provides an overview of the PBR payload and discusses the expected performance of its various detectors.</description>

      <title>Exoplanetary atmospheres retrieval via a quantum extreme learning machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave inference at GPU speed: A bilby-like nested sampling kernel within blackjax-ns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of the gravitational-wave Bayesian inference pipeline for parameter estimation and model comparison. Specifically, we implement the `acceptance-walk' sampling method, a cornerstone algorithm for gravitational-wave inference within the bilby and dynesty framework. By integrating this trusted kernel with the vectorized blackjax-ns framework, we achieve typical speedups of 20-40x for aligned spin binary black hole analyses, while recovering posteriors and evidences that are statistically identical to the original CPU implementation. This faithful re-implementation of a community-standard algorithm establishes a foundational benchmark for gravitational-wave inference. It quantifies the performance gains attributable solely to the architectural shift to GPUs, creating a vital reference against which future parallel sampling algorithms can be rigorously assessed. This allows for a clear distinction between algorithmic innovation and the inherent speedup from hardware. Our work provides a validated community tool for performing GPU-accelerated nested sampling in gravitational-wave data analyses.</description>

      <title>A compact, low-power epithermal neutron counter for lunar water detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of lunar water are critical for enabling sustainable human and robotic exploration of the Moon. Orbital neutron spectrometers, such as instruments on Lunar Prospector and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, have revealed hydrogen-rich regions near the poles but are limited by coarse spatial resolution and low counting efficiency. We present a compact, lightweight, and low-power epithermal neutron detector based on boron-coated silicon imagers, designed to probe subsurface hydrogen at decimeter scales from mobile platforms such as lunar rovers. This instrument leverages the high neutron capture cross-section of $^{10}$B to convert epithermal neutrons into detectable $\alpha$ and $^{7}$Li ions in a fully-depleted silicon imager, providing a unique event topology to identify neutrons while suppressing backgrounds. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that a 3 $\mu$m boron layer achieves optimal neutron detection efficiency, further enhanced with polyethylene moderation to improve sensitivity to the 0.4 eV-500 keV epithermal energy range. For a 10 cm$^2$ active area, the detector achieves sensitivity to H$_2$O weight fractions as low as 0.01 wt % in a 15 minute measurement. This scalable, portable, low-mass design is well-suited for integration into upcoming Artemis and commercial lunar rovers, providing a transformative capability for in-situ resource prospecting and ground-truth validation of orbital measurements.</description>

      <title>SILVIA: Ultra-precision formation flying demonstration for space-based interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose SILVIA (Space Interferometer Laboratory Voyaging towards Innovative Applications), a mission concept designed to demonstrate ultra-precision formation flying between three spacecraft separated by 100 m. SILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by integrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise micro-propulsion for real-time measurement and control of distances and relative orientations between spacecraft. A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good balance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This mission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including gravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared interferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for direct imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates. The mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for the next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Using Active Learning to Improve Quasar Identification for the DESI Spectra Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey uses an automatic spectral classification pipeline to classify spectra. QuasarNET is a convolutional neural network used as part of this pipeline originally trained using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In this paper we implement an active learning algorithm to optimally select spectra to use for training a new version of the QuasarNET weights file using only DESI data, specifically to improve classification accuracy. This active learning algorithm includes a novel outlier rejection step using a Self-Organizing Map to ensure we label spectra representative of the larger quasar sample observed in DESI. We perform two iterations of the active learning pipeline, assembling a final dataset of 5600 labeled spectra, a small subset of the approx 1.3 million quasar targets in DESI's Data Release 1. When splitting the spectra into training and validation subsets we meet or exceed the previously trained weights file in completeness and purity calculated on the validation dataset with less than one tenth of the amount of training data. The new weights also more consistently classify objects in the same way when used on unlabeled data compared to the old weights file. In the process of improving QuasarNET's classification accuracy we discovered a systemic error in QuasarNET's redshift estimation and used our findings to improve our understanding of QuasarNET's redshifts.</description>

      <title>An accurate measurement of the spectral resolution of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral resolution ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda$) of spectroscopic data is crucial information for accurate kinematic measurements. In this letter, we present a robust measurement of the spectral resolution of the JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) in fixed slit (FS) and integral field spectroscopy (IFS) modes. Due to the similarity of the utilized slit dimension if the FS mode to that of the shutters in the multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode, our resolution measurements in the FS mode can also be used for the MOS mode in principle. We modeled H and He lines of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58 using a Gaussian line spread function (LSF) to estimate the wavelength-dependent resolution for multiple disperser and filter combinations. We corrected for the intrinsic width of the planetary nebula's H and He lines due to its expansion velocity by measuring it from a higher-resolution X-shooter spectrum. We find that NIRSpec's in-flight spectral resolutions exceed the pre-launch estimates provided in the JWST User Documentation by 11-53% in the FS mode and by 1-24% in the IFS mode across the covered wavelengths. We recover the expected trend that the resolution increases with the wavelength within a configuration. The robust and accurate LSFs presented in this letter will enable high-accuracy kinematic measurements using NIRSpec for applications in cosmology and galaxy evolution.</description>

Abstract: The South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM) experiment is a pathfinder for demonstrating the use of on-chip spectrometers for millimeter Line Intensity Mapping. We present spectral bandpass measurements of the SLIM spectrometer channels made on site using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer during SPT-SLIMs first deployment the 2024-2025 austral summer observing season. Through this we demonstrate a technique for measuring the narrow band passes of the SPT-SLIM filterbanks that improves beyond the intrinsic resolution of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning pipeline for real-time detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The promise of multi-messenger astronomy relies on the rapid detection of gravitational waves at very low latencies ($\mathcal{O}$(1\,s)) in order to maximize the amount of time available for follow-up observations. In recent years, neural-networks have demonstrated robust non-linear modeling capabilities and millisecond-scale inference at a comparatively small computational footprint, making them an attractive family of algorithms in this context. However, integration of these algorithms into the gravitational-wave astrophysics research ecosystem has proven non-trivial. Here, we present the first fully machine learning-based pipeline for the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) running in low-latency. We demonstrate this pipeline to have a fraction of the latency of traditional matched filtering search pipelines while achieving state-of-the-art sensitivity to higher-mass stellar binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing Benchmark Models of Hidden-Sector Dark Matter with DAMIC-M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles interacting with electrons using the DAMIC-M prototype detector at the Modane Underground Laboratory. The data feature a significantly lower detector single $e^-$ rate (factor 50) compared to our previous search, while also accumulating a ten times larger exposure of $\sim$1.3 kg-day. DM interactions in the skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are searched for as patterns of two or three consecutive pixels with a total charge between 2 and 4 $e^-$. We find 144 candidates of 2 $e^-$ and 1 candidate of 4 $e^-$, where 141.5 and 0.071, respectively, are expected from background. With no evidence of a DM signal, we place stringent constraints on DM particles with masses between 1 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$ interacting with electrons through an ultra-light or heavy mediator. For large ranges of DM masses below 1 GeV/c$^2$, we exclude theoretically-motivated benchmark scenarios where hidden-sector particles are produced as a major component of DM in the Universe through the freeze-in or freeze-out mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>K2-18b Does Not Meet The Standards of Evidence For Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: K2-18b, a temperate sub-Neptune, has garnered significant attention due to claims of possible biosignatures in its atmosphere. Low-confidence detections of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) have sparked considerable debate, primarily around arguments that their absorption features are not uniquely identifiable. Here, we consider all five questions from the astrobiology standards of evidence framework, starting with: Have we detected an authentic signal? To answer this, we analyzed publicly-available JWST observations of K2-18b using independent data reduction and spectral retrieval methodologies. Our comprehensive set of reductions demonstrates that the MIRI transit spectrum is highly susceptible to unresolved instrumental systematics. Applying different wavelength binning schemes yields a potpourri of planet spectra that then lead to a wide assortment of atmospheric interpretations. Consequently, we offer recommendations to help minimize this previously-underappreciated instrument systematic in future MIRI reductions of any exoplanet. While the MIRI binning scheme adopted by Madhusudhan et al. (2025) favors the presence of DMS/DMDS in K2-18b, we find that 87.5% of retrievals using our preferred MIRI binning scheme do not. When considering the full, 0.7 - 12 micron transit spectrum, we confirm the detection of CH4 and favor CO2, and find the presence of DMS and C2H4 to be interchangeable. Moreover, we find that the tentative presence of large features in the MIRI transit spectrum is in tension with the more robust, yet smaller, features observed in the near IR. We conclude that red noise -- rather than an astrophysical signal -- plagues the mid-IR data and there is, as yet, no statistically significant evidence for biosignatures in the atmosphere of K2-18b.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>
