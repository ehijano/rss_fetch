      <title>The Relationship between Consumer Theories with and without Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the assumption that the utility maximization hypothesis implicitly adds to consumer theory, we consider a mathematical representation of pre-marginal revolution consumer theory based on subjective exchange ratios. We introduce two axioms on subjective exchange ratio, and show that both axioms hold if and only if consumer behavior is consistent with the utility maximization hypothesis. Moreover, we express the process for a consumer to find the transaction stopping point in terms of differential equations, and prove that the conditions for its stability are equal to the two axioms introduced in the above argument. Therefore, the consumer can find his/her transaction stopping point if and only if his/her behavior is consistent with the utility maximization hypothesis. In addition to these results, we discuss equivalence conditions for axioms to evaluate their mathematical strength, and methods for expressing the theory of subjective exchange ratios in terms of binary relations.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of diversity on corporate boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity in leadership positions and corporate boards is an important aspect of equality. It is important because it is the key to better decision-making and innovation, and above all, it paves the way for future generations to participate and shape our society. Many studies emphasize the importance of the visibility of role models and the effect that connectivity has on the success of minorities in leadership. However, the connectivity of firms, the dynamics of the adoption of minorities, and the long-term effects have not been well understood. Here, we present a model that shows how these effects work together in a dynamic model that is calibrated with empirical data of firm and board networks. We show that homophily -- the appointment of minorities is influenced by the presence of minorities in a board and its neighboring entities -- is an important effect shaping the trajectory towards equality. We further show how perception biases and feedback related to the centrality of minority members influence the dynamic. We find that reaching equality can be sped up or slowed down depending on the distribution of minorities in central firms. These insights bear significant implications for policy-making geared towards fostering equality and diversity within corporate boards.</description>

      <title>Allocation Mechanisms in Decentralized Exchange Markets with Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical theory of efficient allocations of an aggregate endowment in a pure-exchange economy has hitherto primarily focused on the Pareto-efficiency of allocations, under the implicit assumption that transfers between agents are frictionless, and hence costless to the economy. In this paper, we argue that certain transfers cause frictions that result in costs to the economy. We show that these frictional costs are tantamount to a form of subadditivity of the cost of transferring endowments between agents. We suggest an axiomatic study of allocation mechanisms, that is, the mechanisms that transform feasible allocations into other feasible allocations, in the presence of such transfer costs. Among other results, we provide an axiomatic characterization of those allocation mechanisms that admit representations as robust (worst-case) linear allocation mechanisms, as well as those mechanisms that admit representations as worst-case conditional expectations. We call the latter Robust Conditional Mean Allocation mechanisms, and we relate our results to the literature on (decentralized) risk sharing within a pool of agents.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Instant Runoff Voting to Allow Indifferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is used in elections for many political offices around the world. It allows voters to specify their preferences among candidates as a ranking. We identify a generalization of the rule, called Approval-IRV, that allows voters more freedom by allowing them to give equal preference to several candidates. Such weak orders are a more expressive input format than linear orders, and they help reduce the cognitive effort of voting.
  Just like standard IRV, Approval-IRV proceeds in rounds by successively eliminating candidates. It interprets each vote as an approval vote for its most-preferred candidates among those that have not been eliminated. At each step, it eliminates the candidate who is approved by the fewest voters. Among the large class of scoring elimination rules, we prove that Approval-IRV is the unique way of extending IRV to weak orders that preserves its characteristic axiomatic properties, in particular independence of clones and respecting a majority's top choices. We also show that Approval-IRV is the unique extension of IRV among rules in this class that satisfies a natural monotonicity property defined for weak orders.
  Prior work has proposed a different generalization of IRV, which we call Split-IRV, where instead of approving, each vote is interpreted as splitting 1 point equally among its top choices (for example, 0.25 points each if a vote has 4 top choices), and then eliminating the candidate with the lowest score. Split-IRV fails independence of clones, may not respect majority wishes, and fails our monotonicity condition.
  The multi-winner version of IRV is known as Single Transferable Vote (STV). We prove that Approval-STV continues to satisfy the strong proportional representation properties of STV, underlining that the approval way is the right way of extending the IRV/STV idea to weak orders.</description>

      <title>On the Instability of Fractional Reserve Banking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic monetary model to study the (in)stability of the fractional reserve banking system. The model shows that the fractional reserve banking system can endanger stability in that equilibrium is more prone to exhibit endogenous cyclic, chaotic, and stochastic dynamics under lower reserve requirements, although it can increase consumption in the steady-state. Introducing endogenous unsecured credit to the baseline model does not change the main results. The calibrated exercise suggests that this channel could be another source of economic fluctuations. This paper also provides empirical evidence that is consistent with the prediction of the model.</description>
