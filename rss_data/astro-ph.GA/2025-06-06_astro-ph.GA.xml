      <title>Differential measurement of m_e/m_p: 3 mm methanol lines toward Sagittarius B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p (the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data), the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to (-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5 sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).</description>

      <title>Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive ($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 = 180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median $M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.</description>

      <title>FROST-CLUSTERS -- II. Massive stars, binaries and triples boost supermassive black hole seed formation in assembling star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics and stellar evolution to investigate this collisional assembly with the \bifrost{} code coupled to the \sevn{} stellar evolution module. With a full initial stellar mass function, we study the effect of initial binary and triple stars as well a high initial single star mass limit (450 $M_\odot$) on the hierarchical assembly, structure, and kinematics of massive ($M_\mathrm {cl}\sim10^6 M_\odot$, $N=1.8 \times 10^6$) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH) mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit increase the numbers (up to $\sim$ 10) and masses (up to $10^4 M_\odot$) of the formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak at $\Gamma_\mathrm {tde}\sim 5 \times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ shortly after IMBH formation at $\sim 2$ Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions approximately as $M_\bullet \propto M_\mathrm{cl}$, $M_\bullet \propto \Sigma_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{3/2}$ and $M_\bullet \propto \sigma^\mathrm{3}$. Our results suggest IMBH masses above $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$ for the dense $z\sim10$ star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of galaxy properties from JWST pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to $\mathrm{S/N}_{\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies ($&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Long Term Reverberation Mapping of Iron Coronal Lines in MKN 110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present flux measurements of the coronal lines [Fe VII] and [Fe X] spanning three decades, in the highly variable Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) MKN 110. These coronal lines are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGNs in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Neither [Fe VII] nor [Fe X] demonstrates variability in the short term on a weekly or monthly timescale. However, by taking advantage of a long term decrease in the continuum flux of MKN 110 on the order of years, we were able to track the [Fe VII] and [Fe X] fluxes as they respond to the continuum. We were able to detect a lag for [Fe VII] relative to the continuum at 5100 {\AA}, with a modal lag of 652 days, but were unable to detect a significant lag in the [Fe x] flux, though there exist significant uncertainties in the [Fe X] fit. These two lag results are not consistent and the line widths for the two line species also do not match. This provides strong evidence for stratification within the coronal line region (CLR). There is also evidence of a non-varying component within the coronal line flux, probably a result of a more extended region of origin. Taken together, these results suggest a CLR where the bulk of the [Fe VII] originates on parsec scales, but a portion of the [Fe VII] flux originates further out, at or beyond a 10 pc scale. These results also indicate the limitations of single-cloud models in describing the physical conditions of the CLR.</description>

      <title>A large, chemically enriched, neutral gas reservoir in a galaxy at z = 6.782</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of the neutral gas of a galaxy at z&gt;6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as $d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z&gt;6 determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})&gt;14.3$. The observed metallicity of the host galaxy system is [Zn/H]&gt;-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be common features of galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z &gt;= 4 known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)</description>

      <title>ViT-based Local Volume dwarf galaxy Identificationin (VIDA) in the CSST survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume is crucial for constraining the luminosity function of satellite galaxies in the nearby universe. We report the detection capabilities of dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume using the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Based on the simulated imaging data of CSST, we develop a detection and classification pipeline that combines traditional image-based search techniques with advanced machine learning classification models. The simulated Local Volume dwarf galaxies can be identified using a pre-processing method for "extended source detection", followed by classification with a pretrained ViT-Base model. This pipeline achieves a true positive rate (TPR) exceeding 85% with a false positive rate (FPR) of only 0.1%. We quantify the detection completeness of Local Volume dwarf galaxies across a three-dimensional parameter space defined by absolute magnitude ($M_V$), half-light radius ($R_h$), and heliocentric distance, based on simulated single-exposure CSST wide-field imaging survey data. For unresolved or semi-resolved dwarf galaxies, our method achieves a significantly deeper absolute magnitude detection limit compared to catalog-based approaches, reaching $M_V = -7$ within 10 \Mpc. By combining this image-based approach with traditional stellar catalog-based "matched filter" techniques, our automated framework established in this work can identify dwarf galaxies within 20 \Mpc for the CSST mission.</description>

      <title>Mergers and Recoil in Triple Massive Black Hole Systems from Illustris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) form through galaxy mergers and are among the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the universe. If the binary inspiral time is long, a subsequent galaxy merger can introduce a third black hole, forming a triple system. In the Illustris cosmological simulation, 6% of MBHBs form such triples at parsec scales, where strong three-body interactions are likely. We apply results from numerical simulations of triple MBHs to strong triples identified in Illustris to assess their impact on MBH mergers and recoils. We find that strong triple interactions increase the overall merger fraction by 4%. Including triple interactions raises the merger fraction of MBHs in strong triple systems from 40% to 69%, relative to modeling binary evolution in isolation. Furthermore, massive, major mergers are over three times more likely to be facilitated by strong triple interactions than mergers in general. We also compare GW recoil kicks to gravitational slingshot kicks from triple interactions. Both mechanisms can produce kicks exceeding host escape speeds, ejecting MBHs and producing wandering or offset black holes. Although slingshots yield the highest velocity kicks, GW recoils dominate the ejected population when assuming random MBH spin orientations. Under this assumption, ejections from GW recoil and slingshot kicks reduce the total number of mergers by 6%. Our results highlight the impact of strong triple dynamics and GW recoils on MBH evolution and support their inclusion in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for AGN obscuration variability in the Chandra archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival data. In this work, we estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the local $(z&lt;0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations ($54\pm11$%), indicative of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability. Interestingly, we also find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 ($f_{\rm Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}$%) and Seyfert 2 ($f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15$%) galaxies, and discuss why we might find a slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$. We also present a sample of 43 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies with multiple Chandra observations whose properties make them promising $N_{\rm H,los}$-variable targets. We discuss the accuracy of our method, and search for potential dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter timescales.</description>

      <title>Mapping the reddening plane in the Galactic disk through interstellar extinction of open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b &lt;= 6 deg, corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude. By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude. Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its implications for the Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>RIDEN pilot survey: broad-band selection of candidate quasars with extended Lyman-$\alpha$ nebulae using CLAUDS-HSC-SSP-DUNES$^2$ joint data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04570</link>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), delivering deep, multi-band ($ugrizy$) imaging data across 18,000 square degrees over the next decade. Before this ultra-wide-field survey, we constructed a broad-band Ly$\alpha$ imaging toward 483 SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z=$ 1.9-3.0, using deep, wide-field ultraviolet to near-infrared ($u$-to-$K$) data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey (HSC-SSP), the CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS), the Deep UKIRT Near-Infrared Steward Survey (DUNES$^2$), and additional public data covering 13 square degrees. Our broad-band selection allowed us to select 24 candidate quasar nebulae that exhibit $u$ or $g$ band excess over 50-170 kpc, some of which exhibit asymmetrical extended features similar to those seen in previously discovered giant nebulae. We then investigated whether the Ly$\alpha$ morphology of quasar nebulae differs between two redshift intervals, $z=$ 1.9-2.3 and $z=$ 2.3-3.0, and examined environmental dependence based on a control sample. Comparison results show no significant difference in asymmetry within Ly$\alpha$ nebulae between the two redshift intervals. Furthermore, we found no systematic differences in overdensities around the complete quasar samples, quasars with large Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, and control samples, while the most extended nebula appears to be located in the high-density region. Further verification analyses are required since the current dataset lacks spectroscopic confirmation for both quasar nebulae and their surrounding neighbours. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the great potential of the Rubin LSST to discover giant Ly$\alpha$ nebulae on an unprecedented scale.</description>

      <title>The future of gravitational wave science unlocking LIGO potential: AI-driven data analysis and exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of gravitational wave astronomy (GW) has revolutionized the observation of cataclysmic cosmic events, such as black hole mergers and neutron star collisions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has been at the forefront of these discoveries. However, the immense volume and complexity of gravitational wave data present significant challenges for traditional analysis methods. This paper investigates the growing synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and GW science, emphasizing how AI enhances signal detection, noise reduction, and data interpretation. It begins with an overview of GW fundamentals and the role of machine learning in increasing detector sensitivity. Notable GW events observed by LIGO are discussed alongside persistent analytical challenges such as data quality, generalization, and computational constraints. A comprehensive performance review of AI techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, is presented based on data spanning 2021 to 2024. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and computational efficiency. Findings indicate that deep learning and supervised learning outperform other approaches, particularly in enhancing TPR and minimizing FPR. While unsupervised and reinforcement learning models offer less precision, they demonstrate high efficiency and potential for real-time applications. The study also explores AI integration into next-generation detectors and waveform reconstruction techniques. Overall, the integration of AI into GW research significantly improves the reliability and speed of event detection, unlocking new possibilities for exploring the dynamic universe. This paper provides a comprehensive outlook on the transformative role of AI in shaping the future of GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Two-Armed Phase Spiral from Multiple External Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies using the Gaia DR3 data have revealed a two-armed phase spiral in the $Z-V_Z$ phase space in the inner disk. In this study, we present new features of the two-armed phase spiral revealed by the Gaia Data and a new mechanism to explain such features with multiple external perturbations. By segmenting the Gaia DR3 RVS catalog based on $J_{\phi}$ (or $R_{g}$) and $\theta_\phi$, we confirm the existence of the clear two-armed phase spiral in the inner disk. Moreover, we identify a different two-armed phase spiral pattern at slightly larger radii, resembling a weak secondary branch along with the prominent major branch. At a given radius, with the azimuthal angle increasing, we observe a systematic transition of the two-armed phase spiral, with the significance of one branch weakened and another branch enhanced. This two-armed phase spiral may be due to the overlapping of distinct one-armed phase spirals. At different radii, the perturbation times estimated from each branch of the two-armed phase spiral are $\sim 320$ Myr and $\sim 500$ Myr, respectively, suggesting that the Galactic disk could be impacted by double external perturbers separated by $\sim 180$ Myr. We also performed test particle simulations of the disk perturbed by two satellite galaxies, which successfully generated a two-armed phase spiral similar to the observation. Both the observation and simulation results suggest that the signature in the $Z-V_Z$ phase space of earlier perturbations may not be completely erased by the more recent one.</description>

      <title>The Centre of Attention: a Powerful Radio Galaxy Pinpoints a NIR-Dark Protocluster at z~3.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a $z\sim3.9$ protocluster identified from Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array Band 3 spectral scans of a bright radio source selected from the GaLactic and Extra-galactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. Extended CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) line emission was detected in GLEAM J005332$-$325630 confirming it to be a $z=3.879$ powerful radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$. This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}&gt;0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with $K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v&lt;700$ km s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i, z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark, very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300 cosmological simulation puts this galaxy in a dark matter halo of $M_{DM}\sim3\times10^{13}$ ${M}_\odot$ which will evolve into a Coma-like DM halo ($M_{DM}\sim10^{15}$ ${M}_\odot$) by the present day.</description>

      <title>Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion by the Nuclear Star Cluster: the Case of M31*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$). In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31* and together provide a mass injection rate of $\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool ($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established. This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of $\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2 parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Rate constants and product yields for the C + CH3CHO reaction at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactions involving atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), play an important role in astrochemistry due to high C-atom abundance levels. Here we performed a kinetic investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and acetaldehyde, CH3CHO, determining rate constants for this process over the 50-296 K range. Measurements of the formation of atomic hydrogen, H(2S), were also performed to provide insight into product formation. Experiments were conducted using a supersonic flow reactor coupled with pulsed laser photolysis for C-atom generation and pulsed laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet range for the detection of both C(3P) and H(2S) atoms. Quantum chemical calculations of the ground triplet state potential energy surface of C3H4O were also performed to provide theoretical support for the measurements. The rate constants were large and temperature independent with an average value of 4.0 x 10-10 cm3 s-1. This result is consistent with the theoretical results which predict either very low barriers or none at all on the underlying potential energy surface. Although experimental difficulties prevented the quantitative determination of H-atom formation, qualitatively, H-atom yields were very low with CH3CH/C2H4 + CO as the major products based on the calculations. The influence of this reaction on interstellar chemistry was tested using a gas-grain model of dense interstellar clouds. These simulations predict that the C(3P) + CH3CHO reaction decreases gas-phase CH3CHO abundances by more than an order of magnitude at early and intermediate cloud ages, with a lower influence at typical dense cloud ages.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cluster Mergers on Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being the most energetic events in the known universe, the impact of galaxy cluster mergers on the properties of the resident galaxies has yet to be well-understood. In this paper, we investigate the effects of merging environments on star formation in nearby clusters ($0.04&lt;z&lt;0.06$) from the SAMI Galaxy Survey - A168, A2399, A3380, and EDCC 0442 - which exhibit different dynamical activity. Using single-fiber spectroscopy from the SAMI Cluster Redshift Survey (SAMI-CRS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we trace star formation (SF) activity across the cluster sample by identifying the star-forming galaxy (SFG) population based on spectral features. We find a mild enhancement in the star-forming galaxy fraction $f_{SFG}$ in merging clusters, although not statistically significant. The spatial and projected phase-space distributions show that SFGs in merging clusters are well-mixed with the passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the relaxed clusters. Analysis of equivalent width of $\rm H\alpha$ line (EW($\rm H\alpha$)), as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence of triggered star formation activity as a function of dynamical state for both the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near possible merger features. This suggests that the increase in $f_{SFG}$ is due to the mixing of galaxies in dynamically complex, young merging systems that are still forming, unlike their older, relaxed counterparts that have had longer to quench.</description>

      <title>The structural and kinematical properties of NGC 5634, a globular cluster associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of NGC 5634 through a comprehensive analysis of its morphology, kinematics and dynamics. Utilizing data from the DESI Legacy Survey, we refined its fundamental parameters (age t = 12.8 +/- 0.3 Gyr, metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.1 dex, distance modulus dm = 17.0 +/- 0.1 mag) and constructed matched-filter template based on the combination of these parameters to search for extra-tidal structures. However, no significant features were detected above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold, which limits our ability to further investigate the association between NGC 5634 and the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream based on morphological evidence. Incorporating GAIA data, we further examine the orbital path of NGC 5634. We found that its orbit only briefly intersects with the Sgr stream and diverges significantly over long-term integrations. This behavior contrasts with that of confirmed Sgr-associated clusters, whose orbits remain closely aligned with the stream throughout their orbital evolution. Additionally, NGC 5634 exhibits a relatively shorter semi-major axis and smaller apocenter and pericenter distances compared to Sgr clusters. These orbital characteristics are more consistent with clusters associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) or the Helmi streams. From a dynamical perspective, in the Lz-E space, NGC 5634 is also distinctly different from Sgr clusters and aligns more closely with the GSE and Helmi regions. Taken together, these findings do not support a strong connection between NGC 5634 and the Sgr dSph, but instead suggest a potential association with another progenitor system, such as GSE or Helmi stream. Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to definitively establish its origin.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with wide binaries -- 3D velocities and distances of wide binaries from Gaia and HARPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide Binaries (WBs) are interesting systems to test Newton-Einstein gravity in low potentials. The basic concept is to verify whether the difference in velocity between the WB components is compatible with what is expected from the Newton law. Previous attempts, based solely on Gaia proper motion differences scaled to transverse velocity differences using mean parallax distances, do not provide conclusive results. Here we add to the Gaia transverse velocities precise measurements of the third velocity component, the radial velocity (RV), in order to identify multiple stars, and to improve the reliability of the test by using velocity differences and positions in three dimensions. We use the HARPS spectra to determine accurate RV difference between the WB components, correcting the observed velocities for gravitational redshift and convective shift. We exploit the Gaia distance distributions to determine the projected and intrinsic separations s and r and the 3-dimensional velocity differences of the binaries. Of the 44 pairs observed with HARPS, 27% show sign of multiplicity or are not suitable for the test, and 32 bona-fide WBs survive our selection. Their projected separation s is up to 14 kAU, or 0.06 parsec. We determine distances, eccentricities and position angles to reproduce the velocity differences according to Newton's law, finding reasonable solutions for all WBs but one, and with some systems possibly too near pericenter and/or at too high inclination. Our (limited) number of WBs does not show obvious trends with separation or acceleration and is consistent with Newtonian dynamics. We are collecting a larger sample of this kind to robustly assess these results.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XIV: CH radical and $H_3^+$ molecular ion in the irradiated protoplanetary disk d203-506</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H$_3^+$ molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10$^{-7}$ and approximately 10$^{-8}$, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H$_3^+$ is usually formed through reactions of H$_2$ with H$_2^+$ originating from cosmic ray ionization of H$_2$. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that H$_3^+$ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated ($G_0&gt;$10$^3$), dense ($n_{\rm H} &gt;10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The latter is favored as an explanation for the presence of ``hot'' H$_3^+$ ($T_{\rm ex}\gtrsim$1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the emission of FUV-pumped H$_2$ and other ``PDR species'', such as CH$^+$, CH$_3^+$, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited H$_3^+$ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and, underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit for the detection of elusive species in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and hot water vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in the irradiated disk d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises the question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or if alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2 + HOC+ -&gt; H3+ + CO and H2 + H+ -&gt; H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v&gt;=4), a process that has not previously been included in disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance peaks at x(H3+)~10^-8, coinciding with regions where HOC+ is also abundant. The high abundances of H3+ and HOC+ are ultimately linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0), the presence of C+, and an enhanced reservoir of hot H2O. The predicted H3+ column densities (~10^13 cm^-2) are consistent with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of irradiated disks. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G0 &gt; 10^3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations provide compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, a non-luminous component dominating the universe's mass-energy budget. Its gravitational influence is well-established on galactic scales; however, dark matter's precise nature and effect on spacetime geometry remain open questions. This study investigates modifications to the Schwarzschild metric due to the presence of dark matter, modeled as a perfect fluid with a specific equation of state. We derive an "exponential" metric incorporating this dark matter contribution and calculate its key characteristics: the event horizon, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and photon sphere. Comparing these with Schwarzschild predictions reveals distinct deviations dependent on the dark matter distribution. Furthermore, we analyze the orbital velocity profiles derived from the exponential metric, demonstrating its potential to explain the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies. Our results underscore the importance of considering modified metrics in accurately describing spacetime near massive objects and provide a theoretical framework for further investigations into dark matter's role in galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured, type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}. Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have also made our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Numerical evolution of self-gravitating halos of self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a modification of a recently developed numerical scheme for evolving spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems to include the effects of self-interacting dark matter. The approach is far more efficient than traditional N-body simulations and cross sections with different dependencies on velocity and scattering-angle are easily accommodated. To demonstrate, we provide results of a simulation, which runs quickly on a personal computer, that shows the expected initial flattening of the inner region of an NFW halo as well as the later gravothermal collapse instability that leads to a dense core at the galactic center. We note that this approach can also be used, with some augmentation, to simulate the dynamics in globular clusters by modeling gravitational hard scattering as a self-interaction.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Jet Dynamics and Collimation Characteristics of 0241+622 on Parsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed analysis of the jet structure and dynamics of the source 0241+622 on milliarcsecond (mas) scales. We stacked images from multiple epochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the relationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits a parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This structure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet. Beyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion speed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We obtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at 1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of the jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of sight to be approximately 65.7{\deg}, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc (de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source within 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits accelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core, we observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as possibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet width may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure, particularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and collimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium conditions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the selection of galaxy groups with end to end simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray (ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups and hydro simulations.</description>

      <title>Model selection using the HII galaxy Hubble diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim 7.5$, mapping the Universe's expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this {\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons. We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.</description>

      <title>Going Bayesian on the ages of nearby young stellar systems I. The expansion rate method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Determining the ages of young stellar systems is fundamental to test and validate current star-formation theories. Aims. We aim at developing a Bayesian version of the expansion rate method that incorporates the a priori knowledge on the stellar system's age and solves some of the caveats of the traditional frequentist approach. Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst others, the system's age. For this later, we propose prior distributions inspired by literature works. Results. We validate our method on a set of extensive simulations mimicking the properties of real stellar systems. In stellar associations between 10 and 40 Myr and up to 150 pc the errors are &lt;10%. In star forming regions up to 400 pc, the error can be as large as 80% at 3 Myr but it rapidly decreases with increasing age. Conclusions. The Bayesian expansion rate methodology that we present here offers several advantages over the traditional frequentist version. In particular, the Bayesian age estimator is more robust and credible than the commonly used the frequentist ones. This new Bayesian expansion rate method is made publicly available as a module of the free and open-source code Kalkayotl.</description>

      <title>Bayesian ages of local young stellar associations I. Through the expansion rate method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Local young stellar associations (LYSAs &lt;50 Myr and &lt;150 pc) are important laboratories to test predictions from star-formation theories. Estimating their ages through various dating techniques with minimal biases is thus of paramount importance. Aims. We aim at determining the ages of LYSAs with the expansion rate dating technique. Methods. We estimate the ages of the LYSAs using literature membership lists, publicly available data (astrometry and radial velocities), and a recent open-source Bayesian code that implements the expansion rate method. This code in combination with simple statistical assumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or populations, and estimate expansion ages. Results. We derive the largest and most methodological homogeneous set of ages of LYSAs. We rediscover three and discover four associations hidden within the literature membership lists of the classical ones. Conclusions. The expansion ages we report here are compatible with literature age estimates. Moreover, our analysis shows that previous age tensions can be explained, in most cases, by the presence of unidentified populations or substructures.</description>

      <title>The significant contribution of supersoft X-ray Sources to the nebular HeII line emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nebular spectral lines provide insight into the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the ionizing radiation within galaxies. The presence of high-energy ionization lines such as \heii indicates the existence of ionizing photons with energies exceeding the second ionization energy of helium ($54 \mathrm{eV})$. There is an enigma surrounding the origin of these lines observed in star-forming galaxies because stellar ionization cannot account for such high energy emission. This paper proposes that supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) may produce the \heii ionization lines in star-forming galaxies. We model the spectra of SSSs using blackbody radiation and add them to the young stellar population spectra to represent the overall spectra of galaxies. Using a photoionization model, we predict the resulting \heiioptic and \hbeta line fluxes and inspect the contribution of SSSs to the elevation of the \heiioptic/\hbeta ratio in star-forming galaxies, both at low and high redshifts. We find that incorporating a blackbody with temperatures between $kT = 10-100 \mathrm{eV}$ can boost the \heiioptic/\hbeta line ratio to the levels observed in local galaxies by SDSS and in early galaxies by NIRSpec. This blackbody temperature range aligns with the observed temperatures of SSSs. The number of SSSs in spiral galaxies listed in Chandra catalogues, and our estimates of the total population, confirms that SSSs are promising candidates for the source of the \heii ionization.</description>

      <title>On the relation between magnetic field strength and gas density in the interstellar medium: A multiscale analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic field strength to gas density relation in the interstellar medium is of fundamental importance. We present and compare Bayesian analyses of the B-n relation for two comprehensive observational data sets: a Zeeman data set and 700 observations using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method. Using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis we present a general, multi-scale broken power-law relation, $B=B_0(n/n_0)^{\alpha}$ , with $\alpha=\alpha_1$ for $n&lt;n_0$ and $\alpha_2$ for $n&gt;n_0$, and with $B_0$ the field strength at $n_0$. For the Zeeman data we find: $\alpha_1={0.15^{+0.06}_{-0.09}}$ for diffuse gas and $\alpha_2 = {0.53^{+0.09}_{-0.07}}$ for dense gas with $n_0 = 4.00^{+12.7}_{-2.90} \times 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. For the DCF data we find: $\alpha_1={0.26^{+0.15}_{-0.15}}$ and $\alpha_2={0.77_{-0.15}^{+0.14}}$, with $n_0=13.9^{+10.1}_{-7.30} \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, where the uncertainties give 68\% credible intervals. We perform a similar analysis on nineteen numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations covering a wide range of physical conditions from protostellar disks to dwarf and Milky Way-like galaxies, completed with the AREPO, Flash, Pencil, and Ramses codes. The resulting exponents depend on several physical factors such as dynamo effects and their time scales, turbulence, and initial seed field strength. \textcolor{red}{We find that the dwarf and Milky Way-like galaxy simulations produce results closest to the observations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation-based hot CGM model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements probing the hot CGM in X-rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations to build a fully self-consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We construct a lightcone and generate mock X-ray observations. We quantify the projection effects, namely the locally correlated large-scale structure in X-rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments. We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X-ray surface brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $\beta$, the exponent quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry forward the current state-of-the-art by also showing the impact of the locally correlated environment on the measured X-ray surface brightness profiles. We also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5-11}\ M_\odot$, $10^{11-11.2}\ M_\odot$, and $10^{11.2-11.5}\ M_\odot$. We find that the contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles increases when the stellar mass decreases.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Properties of Critical Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fraction of the dense cores within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse to form stars. Identifying the physical criteria for instability and analyzing critical core properties is therefore necessary to star formation theory. Here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of "critical cores" on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion in individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While a global linewidth-size relation exists for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations around each core exhibit significant variations. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse; instead, cores collapse at a range of densities determined by the local sonic scale and gravitational potential environment. The critical cores in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. In our low Mach number model which better resolves the characteristic mass and sonic scales, we find marginal evidence that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around a characteristic mass scale associated with the large-scale cloud properties. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time for the purpose of testing gravoturbulent fragmentation theories, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of $2-5 \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$ from the realistic cosmology simulations, \texttt{IllustrisTNG}. We further increase the original resolution of \texttt{IllustrisTNG} by a factor of $\sim 100$ via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing $20 \% - 50 \%$ of the star-forming gas and replenishing $40 \% - 70 \%$ of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-$z$ dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to $\sim 10 \%$ of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</description>

      <title>Network of velocity-coherent filaments formed by supersonic turbulence in a very-high-velocity HI cloud</title>

Abstract: The warm neutral medium (WNM) was thought to be subsonically/transonically turbulent, and it lacks a network of intertwined filaments that are commonly seen in both molecular clouds and cold neutral medium (CNM). Here, we report HI~21 cm line observations of a very-high-velocity (-330 km s$^{-1}$ $&lt;V_{\rm LSR}&lt;$ -250 km s$^{-1}$) cloud (VHVC), using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. For the first time, such a VHVC is clearly revealed to be a supersonic WNM system consisting of a network of velocity-coherent HI~filaments. The filaments are in the forms of slim curves, hubs, and webs, distributed in different layers within the position-position-velocity ({\it ppv}) data cube. The entire cloud has skewed log-normal probability distribution of column density and the filaments themselves show asymmetrical radial density profiles, indicating shock compression by supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, as is also confirmed by our MHD simulation (sonic Mach number $M_{\rm s}=3$ and Alfv\'en Mach number $M_{\rm A}=1$). This work suggests that hierarchical filaments can be established by shocks in a low-density WNM, where gravity is negligible, offering a viable pathway to structure formation in the earliest evolutionary phases of the interstellar medium (ISM).</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>Measuring Interstellar Carbon Abundance via 158 um [CII] Absorption with SOFIA -- A Potential Detection, and Proof-of-Concept for Depletion Studies with Future Far-IR Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.</description>

      <title>Marvelous Metals: Surveying the Circumgalactic Medium of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are uniquely sensitive to energetic feedback processes and are known to experience substantial mass and metal loss from their disk. Here, we investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 64 isolated dwarf galaxies ($6.0&lt;$log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$)$&lt;9.5$) at $z=0$ from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our galaxies produce column densities broadly consistent with current observations. We investigate these column densities in the context of mass and metal retention rates and the physical properties of the CGM. We find $48\pm11\%$ of all baryons within $R_{200c}$ reside in the CGM, with $\sim70\%$ of CGM mass existing in a warm gas phase, $10^{4.5}&lt;T&lt;10^{5.5}$ K that dominates beyond $r/R_{200c}\sim0.5$. Further, the warm and cool ($10^{4.0}&lt;T&lt;10^{4.5}$ K) gas phases each retain $5-10\%$ of metals formed by the dwarf galaxy. The significant fraction of mass and metals residing in the warm CGM phase provides an interpretation for the lack of observed low ion detections beyond $b/R_{200c}\sim0.5$ at $z\sim0$. We find a weak correlation between galaxy mass and total CGM metal retention despite the fraction of metals lost from the halo increasing from $\sim10\%$ to $&gt;40\%$ towards lower masses. Our findings highlight the CGM (primarily its warm component) as a key reservoir of mass and metals for dwarf galaxies across stellar masses and underscore its importance in understanding the baryon cycle in the low-mass regime. Finally, we provide individual galaxy properties of our full sample and quantify the fraction of ultraviolet observable mass to support future observational programs, particularly those aimed at performing a metal budget around dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>COSMOS Web: Morphological quenching and size-mass evolution of brightest group galaxies from z = 3.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural evolution of Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift $z \simeq 0.08$ to $z = 3.7$ using the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}'s 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) across $\sim 0.54~\mathrm{deg}^2$ and MIRI coverage in $\sim 0.2~\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry yields stellar masses, SFRs, and S\'ersic parameters. We classify BGGs as star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV--$r$--$J$ colors and a redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size--mass slopes; (2) effective radii evolve as $R_e \propto (1+z)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha = 1.11 \pm 0.07$ (star-forming) and $1.40 \pm 0.09$ (quiescent); (3) star formation surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) increases with redshift and shows stronger evolution for massive BGGs ($\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.75$); (4) in the $\Sigma_*$--sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process, with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80\% of the quiescent population. These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.</description>

      <title>Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive ($\rm M_*&gt; 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800 arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area $&gt;$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from $z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the GW background of Galactic (sub)solar mass primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-component dark matter models, a fraction $f_\text{pbh}$ of the dark matter could be in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) with (sub)solar masses. Some would have formed binaries that presently trace the Milky Way halo of particle dark matter. We explore the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by such a hypothetical population of Galactic PBH binaries and assess its detectability by the LISA experiment. For this purpose, we model the formation and evolution of early-type PBH binaries accounting for GW hardening and binary disruption in the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the present-day Galactic population of PBH binaries is characterized by very high orbital eccentricities $|1-e|\ll 1$. For a PBH mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$, this yields a GW background that peaks in the millihertz frequency range where the LISA instrumental noise is minimum. While this signal remains below the LISA detection threshold for viable $f_\text{pbh}\lesssim 0.01$, future GW observatories such as DECIGO and BBO could detect it if $0.01\lesssim M_{\rm pbh} \lesssim 0.1 M_\odot$. Furthermore, we anticipate that, after 5 years of observations, LISA should be able to detect $\mathcal{O}(100)$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(1)$) loud Galactic PBH binaries of mass $M_{\rm pbh} \sim 0.1 - 1 M_\odot$ with a SNR $\geq 5$ if $f_{\rm pbh}=0.01$ (resp. $f_{\rm pbh}=0.001$). Nonlinear effects not considered here such as mass accretion and dynamical capture could alter these predictions.</description>
