      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes are List Recoverable with Optimal List Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with random evaluation points are list recoverable up to capacity with optimal output list size, for any input list size.
  Namely, given an input list size $\ell$, a designated rate $R$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that a random RS code is list recoverable from $1-R-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with output list size $L = O(\ell/\varepsilon)$, for field size $q=\exp(\ell,1/\varepsilon) \cdot n^2$. In particular, this shows that random RS codes are list recoverable beyond the ``list recovery Johnson bound''. Such a result was not even known for arbitrary random linear codes. Our technique follows and extends the recent line of work on list decoding of random RS codes, specifically the works of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023), and of Guo and Zhang (FOCS 2023).</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Codebook for RIS-Assisted MU-MISO Communications: Implementation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a new electromagnetic response control solution, which can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels. In this paper, we propose a novel environment-aware codebook protocol for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol which consists of off-line and on-line stages. Secondly, we propose an environment-aware codebook generation scheme, which utilizes the statistical channel state information and alternating optimization method to generate codewords offline. Then, in the on-line stage, we use these pre-designed codewords to configure the RIS, and the optimal codeword resulting in the highest sum rate is adopted for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we analyze the theoretical performance of the proposed protocol considering the channel estimation errors. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Deep Learning for Distributed Detection with Binary Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the realm of rapidly advancing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), distributed detection assumes a significant role in various practical applications. However, critical challenge lies in maintaining robust detection performance while operating within the constraints of limited bandwidth and energy resources. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines model-driven deep learning (DL) with binary quantization to strike a balance between communication overhead and detection performance in WSNs. We begin by establishing the lower bound of detection error probability for distributed detection using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Furthermore, we prove the global optimality of employing identical local quantizers across sensors, thereby maximizing the corresponding Chernoff information. Subsequently, the paper derives the minimum MAP detection error probability (MAPDEP) by inplementing identical binary probabilistic quantizers across the sensors. Moreover, the paper establishes the equivalence between utilizing all quantized data and their average as input to the detector at the fusion center (FC). In particular, we derive the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures the difference between the true posterior probability and output of the proposed detector. Leveraging the MAPDEP and KL divergence as loss functions, the paper proposes model-driven DL method to separately train the probability controller module in the quantizer and the detector module at the FC. Numerical results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves near-optimal performance with reduced complexity for Gaussian hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Value, Representation, Information and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new analytic framework is first formalized via the usage of the Monadology (Leibniz 1898), to expand the understanding of Zermelo-Fraenkel-choice set theory (ZFC) and Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory (NBG). Implicitly, the framework levels value, representation and information separately. Given the fact that there exists a coincidental equivalence between Von Neumann universe and originally-formalized motivation in ZFC, this work hypothesizes the essential of ordered values for one monand, to carry out efficient communication with the rest. This work then focuses on the relationship among values, representation and information (and suggests potential methods for quantitative analysis). First, this framework generalizes the definition of values and representations from "Indexes approximate Values" principle by (Peng 2023) via surreal numbers (Knuth 1974). Second, credited to surreal numbers, this work recursively connects representations and information via subsets of sets. Therefore, the definition to metric space(s) is naturally formed by representations, and quantitative methods (e.g., Hausdorff Distance) can be applied for quantitative analysis among (sub)sets. Third, this framework conjectures that: as long as the metric space is (or can be formed as) complete, the existence tests can be performed via Cauchy Sequence (or its generalized methods). This work finally revisits the communication theory, and suggests new perspectives from the new analytic framework. Particularly, this work hypothesizes a (quantitative) relationship between values and representation, and conjectures that: the optimal construction of representations exists, and it can be derived as the core value of one monad via Cauchy Inequality (or its generalized methods).</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design and Antenna Selection for Dynamic HRIS-aided Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a dynamic hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) is proposed to further enhance the massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, since it supports the dynamic placement of active and passive elements. Specifically, considering the impact of the hardware impairments (HWIs), we investigate the channel-aware configuration of the receive antennas at the base station (BS) and the active/passive elements at the HRIS to improve the reliability of system. To this end, we investigate the average mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem for the HRIS-aided massive MIMO system by jointly optimizing the BS receive antenna selection matrix, the reflection phase coefficients, the reflection amplitude matrix, and the mode selection matrix of the HRIS under the power budget of the HRIS. To tackle the non-convexity and intractability of this problem, we first transform the binary and discrete variables into continuous ones, and then propose a penalty-based exact block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve these subproblems alternately. Numerical simulations demonstrate the great superiority of the proposed scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Green Probabilistic Semantic Communication with Rate Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the energy efficient design for probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) system with rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is investigated. Basic principles are first reviewed to show how the PSC system works to extract, compress and transmit the semantic information in a task-oriented transmission. Subsequently, the process of how multiuser semantic information can be represented, compressed and transmitted with RSMA is presented, during which the semantic compression ratio (SCR) is introduced to directly measure the computation overhead in a transmission task, and communication overhead is indirectly described as well. Hence, the problem of wireless resource allocation jointly considering the computation and communication consumption for the PSC system with RSMA is investigated. Both conventional wireless resource constraints and unique constraints on semantic communication are considered to maximize the energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>On $(\theta, \Theta)$-cyclic codes and their applications in constructing QECCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb F_q$ be a finite field, where $q$ is an odd prime power. Let $R=\mathbb{F}_q+u\mathbb{F}_q+v\mathbb{F}_q+uv\mathbb F_q$ with $u^2=u,v^2=v,uv=vu$. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of $(\theta, \Theta)$-cyclic codes of block length $(r,s )$ over $\mathbb{F}_qR.$ Specifically, we analyze the structure of these codes as left $R[x:\Theta]$-submodules of $\mathfrak{R}_{r,s} = \frac{\mathbb{F}_q[x:\theta]}{\langle x^r-1\rangle} \times \frac{R[x:\Theta]}{\langle x^s-1\rangle}$. Our investigation involves determining generator polynomials and minimal generating sets for this family of codes. Further, we discuss the algebraic structure of separable codes. A relationship between the generator polynomials of $(\theta, \Theta)$-cyclic codes over $\mathbb F_qR$ and their duals is established. Moreover, we calculate the generator polynomials of dual of $(\theta, \Theta)$-cyclic codes. As an application of our study, we provide a construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) from $(\theta, \Theta)$-cyclic codes of block length $(r,s)$ over $\mathbb{F}_qR$. We support our theoretical results with illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Relay Assisted Communication Systems Through Antenna Location Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of resource allocation for fluid antenna relay (FAR) system with antenna location optimization. In the considered model, each user transmits information to a base station (BS) with help of FAR. The antenna location of the FAR is flexible and can be adapted to dynamic location distribution of the users. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem through jointly optimizing the antenna location and bandwidth allocation with meeting the minimum rate requirements, total bandwidth budget, and feasible antenna region constraints. To solve this problem, we obtain the optimal bandwidth in closed form. Based on the optimal bandwidth, the original problem is reduced to the antenna location optimization problem and an alternating algorithm is proposed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the sum rate can be increased by up to 125% compared to the conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Network-Assisted Full-Duplex Cell-Free mmWave Networks: Hybrid MIMO Processing and Multi-Agent DRL-Based Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, where the distribution of the transmitting access points (T-APs) and receiving access points (R-APs) across distinct geographical locations mitigates cross-link interference, facilitating the attainment of a truly flexible duplex mode. To curtail deployment expenses and power consumption for mmWave band operations, each AP incorporates a hybrid digital-analog structure encompassing precoder/combiner functions. However, this incorporation introduces processing intricacies within channel estimation and precoding/combining design. In this paper, we first present a hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing framework and derive explicit expressions for both uplink and downlink achievable rates. Then we formulate a power allocation problem to maximize the weighted bidirectional sum rates. To tackle this non-convex problem, we develop a collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm called multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) for NAFD cell-free mmWave networks. Specifically, given the tightly coupled nature of both uplink and downlink power coefficients in NAFD cell-free mmWave networks, the MATD3 algorithm resolves such coupled conflicts through an interactive learning process between agents and the environment. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation methods within our hybrid MIMO processing paradigm, and demonstrate that our MATD3 algorithm outperforms both multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and conventional power allocation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the cumulative past information generating function (CPIG) and relative cumulative past information generating function (RCPIG). We study its properties. We establish its relation with generalized cumulative past entropy (GCPE). We defined CPIG stochastic order and its relation with dispersive order. We provide the results for the CPIG measure of the convoluted random variables in terms of the measures of its components. We found some inequality relating to Shannon entropy, CPIG and GCPE. Some characterization and estimation results are also discussed regarding CPIG. We defined divergence measures between two random variables, Jensen-cumulative past information generating function(JCPIG), Jensen fractional cumulative past entropy measure, cumulative past Taneja entropy, and Jensen cumulative past Taneja entropy information measure.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Resource Management in Edge Learning: A Joint Pre-training and Fine-tuning Design Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some applications, edge learning is experiencing a shift in focusing from conventional learning from scratch to new two-stage learning unifying pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. This paper considers the problem of joint communication and computation resource management in a two-stage edge learning system. In this system, model pre-training is first conducted at an edge server via centralized learning on local pre-stored general data, and then task-specific fine-tuning is performed at edge devices based on the pre-trained model via federated edge learning. For the two-stage learning model, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the average squared gradient norm bound), which characterizes the impacts of various system parameters such as the number of learning rounds and batch sizes in the two stages on the convergence rate. Based on our analytical results, we then propose a joint communication and computation resource management design to minimize an average squared gradient norm bound, subject to constraints on the transmit power, overall system energy consumption, and training delay. The decision variables include the number of learning rounds, batch sizes, clock frequencies, and transmit power control for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design. It is shown that the proposed joint resource management over the pre-training and fine-tuning stages well balances the system performance trade-off among the training accuracy, delay, and energy consumption. The proposed design is also shown to effectively leverage the inherent trade-off between pre-training and fine-tuning, which arises from the differences in data distribution between pre-stored general data versus real-time task-specific data, thus efficiently optimizing overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of RIS-Assisted Spatial Modulation for Downlink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted spatial modulation (SM) downlink communication systems, focusing on the average bit error probability (ABEP). Notably, in scenarios with a large number of reflecting units, the composite channel can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution using the central limit theorem. The receiver utilizes a maximum likelihood detector to recover information in both spatial and symbol domains. In the proposed RIS-SM system, we analytically derive a closed-form expression for the union tight upper bound of ABEP, employing the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method. The validity of these results is rigorously confirmed through exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user hybrid beamforming scheme with a sub-connected structure, where multiple movable sub-arrays can independently change their positions within different local regions. To maximize the system sum rate, we jointly optimize the digital beamformer, analog beamformer, and positions of subarrays, under the constraints of unit modulus, finite movable regions, and power budget. Due to the non-concave/non-convex objective function/constraints, as well as the highly coupled variables, the formulated problem is challenging to solve. By employing fractional programming, we develop an alternating optimization framework to solve the problem via a combination of Lagrange multipliers, penalty method, and gradient descent. Numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-aided hybrid beamforming scheme significantly improves the sum rate compared to its fixed-position antenna (FPA) counterpart. Moreover, with sufficiently large movable regions, the proposed scheme with sub-connected MA arrays even outperforms the fully-connected FPA array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided physical layer security (PLS) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the base station (BS) transmits secrecy information with the aid of STAR-RIS against multiple eavesdroppers equipped with multiple antennas. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS and passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS, subject to the hardware constraint for STAR-RIS. To handle the coupling variables, a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is applied. In particular, the amplitudes and phases of STAR-RIS are divided into two blocks to simplify the algorithm design. Besides, by applying the Majorization-Minimization (MM) method, we derive a closed-form expression of the STAR-RIS's phase shifts. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, especially as the number of STAR-RIS elements increases.</description>

      <title>The Rate-Distortion-Perception Trade-off: The Role of Private Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image compression, with recent advances in generative modeling, the existence of a trade-off between the rate and the perceptual quality (realism) has been brought to light, where the realism is measured by the closeness of the output distribution to the source. It has been shown that randomized codes can be strictly better under a number of formulations. In particular, the role of common randomness has been well studied. We elucidate the role of private randomness in the compression of a memoryless source $X^n=(X_1,...,X_n)$ under two kinds of realism constraints. The near-perfect realism constraint requires the joint distribution of output symbols $(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ to be arbitrarily close the distribution of the source in total variation distance (TVD). The per-symbol near-perfect realism constraint requires that the TVD between the distribution of output symbol $Y_t$ and the source distribution be arbitrarily small, uniformly in the index $t.$ We characterize the corresponding asymptotic rate-distortion trade-off and show that encoder private randomness is not useful if the compression rate is lower than the entropy of the source, however limited the resources in terms of common randomness and decoder private randomness may be.</description>

      <title>Density Evolution Analysis of Generalized Low-density Parity-check Codes under a Posteriori Probability Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the performance of generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes under the a posteriori probability (APP) decoder is analyzed. We explore the concentration, symmetry, and monotonicity properties of GLDPC codes under the APP decoder, extending the applicability of density evolution to GLDPC codes. We demonstrate that with an appropriate proportion of generalized constraint (GC) nodes, GLDPC codes can reduce the original gap to capacity compared to their original LDPC counterparts over the BEC and BI-AWGN channels. Additionally, on the BI-AWGN channel, we adopt Gaussian mixture distributions to approximate the message distributions from variable nodes and Gaussian distributions for those from constraint nodes. This approximation technique significantly enhances the precision of the channel parameter threshold compared to traditional Gaussian approximations while maintaining a low computational complexity similar to that of Gaussian approximations. Our simulation experiments provide empirical evidence that GLDPC codes, when decoded with the APP decoder and equipped with the right fraction of GC nodes, can achieve substantial performance improvements compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Joint Beam Scheduling and Beamforming Design for Cooperative Positioning in Multi-beam LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative positioning with multiple low earth orbit (LEO) satellites is promising in providing location-based services and enhancing satellite-terrestrial communication. However, positioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best combination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam interference, this paper explores the utilization of flexible beam scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can adjust beam directions toward the same earth-fixed cell to send positioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formulated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we first prove the monotonic relationship between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem, and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Simulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy is improved by $17.1\%$ and $55.9\%$ when the beam transmission power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Age of Information in a Single-Source Generate-at-Will Dual-Server Status Update System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study age of information (AoI) in a single-source dual-server status update system for the generate at will (GAW) scenario, consisting of an information source, dual servers, and a monitor. For this system, the method of stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) was used to obtain the mean AoI for the work-conserving ZW (zero wait) policy with out-of-order packet discarding at the monitor. In this paper, we propose a non-work-conserving F/P (freeze/preempt) policy for which the sampling and transmission process is frozen for an Erlang distributed amount of time upon each transmission, and out-of-order packets are preempted immediately at the source, rather than being discarded at the monitor upon reception. We use the absorbing Markov chain (AMC) method to obtain the exact distributions of AoI and also the peak AoI (PAoI) processes, for both ZW and F/P policies. Numerical results are presented for the validation of the proposed analytical model and a comparative evaluation of ZW and F/P policies.</description>

      <title>Variable-Length Stop-Feedback Coding for Minimum Age of Incorrect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) in the context of remote monitoring of a symmetric Markov source using variable-length stop-feedback (VLSF) coding. We consider sources with small cardinality, where feedback is non-instantaneous, as the transmitted information and feedback may have comparable lengths. We leverage recent results on the non-asymptotic achievable channel coding rate to derive optimal feedback sequences, i.e. the times of feedback transmissions, in terms of either AoII or delay. Our results showcase the impact of the feedback sequence and SNR on the AoII, revealing that a lower average delay does not necessarily correspond to a lower average AoII. We discuss implications and suggest directions for efficient coding scheme design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops an analytical framework for studying information divergences and likelihood ratios associated with Poisson processes and point patterns on general measurable spaces. The main results include explicit analytical formulas for Kullback-Leibler divergences, R\'enyi divergences, Hellinger distances, and likelihood ratios of the laws of Poisson point patterns in terms of their intensity measures. The general results yield similar formulas for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, compound Poisson processes, as well as spatial and marked Poisson point patterns. Additional results include simple characterisations of absolute continuity, mutual singularity, and the existence of common dominating measures. The analytical toolbox is based on Tsallis divergences of sigma-finite measures on abstract measurable spaces. The treatment is purely information-theoretic and free of any topological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Wideband Channel Capacity Maximization With Beyond Diagonal RIS Reflection Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the promising beamforming gains offered by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a new hardware architecture, known as \emph{beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS)}, has recently been proposed. This architecture enables controllable signal flows between the RIS elements, thereby providing greater design flexibility. However, the physics-imposed symmetry and orthogonality conditions on the non-diagonal reflection matrix make the design challenging. In this letter, we analyze how a BD-RIS can improve a wideband channel, starting from fundamental principles and deriving the capacity. Our analysis considers the effects of various channel taps and their frequency-domain characteristics. We introduce a new algorithm designed to optimize the configuration of the BD-RIS to maximize wideband capacity. The proposed algorithm has better performance than the benchmarks. A BD-RIS is beneficial compared to a conventional RIS in the absence of static path or when the Rician $\kappa$-factor is smaller than $10$.</description>

Abstract: Linear regression is a fundamental and primitive problem in supervised machine learning, with applications ranging from epidemiology to finance. In this work, we propose methods for speeding up distributed linear regression. We do so by leveraging randomized techniques, while also ensuring security and straggler resiliency in asynchronous distributed computing systems. Specifically, we randomly rotate the basis of the system of equations and then subsample blocks, to simultaneously secure the information and reduce the dimension of the regression problem. In our setup, the basis rotation corresponds to an encoded encryption in an approximate gradient coding scheme, and the subsampling corresponds to the responses of the non-straggling servers in the centralized coded computing framework. This results in a distributive iterative stochastic approach for matrix compression and steepest descent.</description>

      <title>Distributed Precoding for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks Without Sharing CSIT: A Rate-Splitting Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are promising architecture for providing global coverage. In STINs, full frequency reuse between a satellite and a terrestrial base station (BS) is encouraged for aggressive spectrum reuse, which induces non-negligible amount of interference. To address the interference management problem in STINs, this paper proposes a novel distributed precoding method. Key features of our method are: i) a rate-splitting (RS) strategy is incorporated for efficient interference management and ii) the precoders are designed in a distributed way without sharing channel state information between a satellite and a terrestrial BS. Specifically, to design the precoders in a distributed fashion, we put forth a spectral efficiency decoupling technique, that disentangles the total spectral efficiency function into two distinct terms, each of which is dependent solely on the satellite's precoder and the terrestrial BS's precoder, respectively. Then, to resolve the non-smoothness raised by the RS strategy, we approximate the spectral efficiency expression as a smooth function by using the LogSumExp technique; thereafter we develop a generalized power iteration inspired optimization algorithm built based on the first-order optimality condition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers considerable spectral efficiency gains compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Variant Codes Based on A Special Polynomial Ring and Their Fast Computations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary array codes are widely used in storage systems to prevent data loss, such as the Redundant Array of Independent Disks~(RAID). Most designs for such codes, such as Blaum-Roth~(BR) codes and Independent-Parity~(IP) codes, are carried out on the polynomial ring F_2[x]/&lt;\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^i &gt;, where F_2 is a binary field, and p is a prime number. In this paper, we consider the polynomial ring F_2[x]/&lt;\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}x^{i\tau}&gt;, where p&gt;1 is an odd number and \tau \geq 1 is any power of two, and explore variant codes from codes over this polynomial ring. Particularly, the variant codes are derived by mapping parity-check matrices over the polynomial ring to binary parity-check matrices.
  Specifically, we first propose two classes of variant codes, termed V-ETBR and V-ESIP codes. To make these variant codes binary maximum distance separable~(MDS) array codes that achieve optimal storage efficiency, this paper then derives the connections between them and their counterparts over polynomial rings. These connections are general, making it easy to construct variant MDS array codes from various forms of matrices over polynomial rings. Subsequently, some instances are explicitly constructed based on Cauchy and Vandermonde matrices. In the proposed constructions, both V-ETBR and V-ESIP MDS array codes can have any number of parity columns and have the total number of data columns of exponential order with respect to $p$. In terms of computation, two fast syndrome computations are proposed for the Vandermonde-based V-ETBR and V-ESIP MDS array codes, both meeting the lowest known asymptotic complexity among MDS codes. Due to the fact that all variant codes are constructed from parity-check matrices over simple binary fields instead of polynomial rings, they are attractive in practice.</description>

      <title>Random ISAC Signals Deserve Dedicated Precoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radar systems typically employ well-designed deterministic signals for target sensing, while integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems have to adopt random signals to convey useful information. This paper analyzes the sensing and ISAC performance relying on random signaling in a multi-antenna system. Towards this end, we define a new sensing performance metric, namely, ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE), which characterizes the estimation error averaged over random ISAC signals. Then, we investigate a data-dependent precoding (DDP) scheme to minimize the ELMMSE in sensing-only scenarios, which attains the optimized performance at the cost of high implementation overhead. To reduce the cost, we present an alternative data-independent precoding (DIP) scheme by stochastic gradient projection (SGP). Moreover, we shed light on the optimal structures of both sensing-only DDP and DIP precoders. As a further step, we extend the proposed DDP and DIP approaches to ISAC scenarios, which are solved via a tailored penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DDP and DIP methods achieve substantial performance gains over conventional ISAC signaling schemes that treat the signal sample covariance matrix as deterministic, which proves that random ISAC signals deserve dedicated precoding designs.</description>

      <title>Joint Visibility Region and Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-scale MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the joint visibility region (VR) detection and channel estimation (CE) problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems considering both the spherical wavefront effect and spatial non-stationary (SnS) property. Unlike existing SnS CE methods that rely on the statistical characteristics of channels in the spatial or delay domain, we propose an approach that simultaneously exploits the antenna-domain spatial correlation and the wavenumber-domain sparsity of SnS channels. To this end, we introduce a two-stage VR detection and CE scheme. In the first stage, the belief regarding the visibility of antennas is obtained through a VR detection-oriented message passing (VRDO-MP) scheme, which fully exploits the spatial correlation among adjacent antenna elements. In the second stage, leveraging the VR information and wavenumber-domain sparsity, we accurately estimate the SnS channel employing the belief-based orthogonal matching pursuit (BB-OMP) method. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms lead to a significant enhancement in VR detection and CE accuracy as compared to existing methods, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Based on User Distribution: Modeling and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional (6D) movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna/two-dimensional (2D) movable antenna (FA/2DMA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennas' movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS can significantly improve the network capacity as compared to the benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or 6DMAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Local Correctability from Local Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the first asymptotically good relaxed locally correctable codes with polylogarithmic query complexity, bringing the upper bound polynomially close to the lower bound of Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021). Our result follows from showing that a high-rate locally testable code can boost the block length of a smaller relaxed locally correctable code, while preserving the correcting radius and incurring only a modest additive cost in rate and query complexity. We use the locally testable code's tester to check if the amount of corruption in the input is low; if so, we can "zoom-in" to a suitable substring of the input and recurse on the smaller code's local corrector. Hence, iterating this operation with a suitable family of locally testable codes due to Dinur, Evra, Livne, Lubotzky, and Mozes (STOC 2022) yields asymptotically good codes with relaxed local correctability, arbitrarily large block length, and polylogarithmic query complexity.
  Our codes asymptotically inherit the rate and distance of any locally testable code used in the final invocation of the operation. Therefore, our framework also yields nonexplicit relaxed locally correctable codes with polylogarithmic query complexity that have rate and distance approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.</description>

      <title>Joint AP-UE Association and Power Factor Optimization for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uplink sum-throughput of distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) networks depends majorly on Access point (AP)-User Equipment (UE) association and power control. The AP-UE association and power control both are important problems in their own right in distributed mMIMO networks to improve scalability and reduce front-haul load of the network, and to enhance the system performance by mitigating the interference and boosting the desired signals, respectively. Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on addressing these two problems separately, this work addresses the uplink sum-throughput maximization problem in distributed mMIMO networks by solving the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, while maintaining Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements for each UE. To improve scalability, we present an l1-penalty function that delicately balances the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and front-haul signaling load. Our proposed methodology leverages fractional programming, Lagrangian dual formation, and penalty functions to provide an elegant and effective iterative solution with guaranteed convergence. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed technique for maximizing sum-throughput while considering the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, demonstrating its superiority over approaches that address these problems individually. Furthermore, the results show that the introduced penalty function can help us effectively control the maximum front-haul load.</description>
