      <title>Complete non-singular toric varieties with Picard number 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all complete non-singular toric varieties with Picard number four via a combinatorial framework based on fanlike simplicial spheres and characteristic maps. This classification yields $59$ fanlike seeds with Picard number four, along with all toric manifolds supported by them. As a consequence, we resolve a conjecture of Gretenkort, Kleinschmidt, and Sturmfels by presenting the first known examples of toric manifolds supported by neighborly polytopes. We also answer a question of Batyrev concerning minimal non-faces of such spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a triangulated equivalence between the derived categories of quasi-coherent and contraherent $\mathcal A$-modules for a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra $\mathcal A$ over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$. The sheaf of rings of differential operators $\mathcal D$ (or fiberwise differential operators for a smooth morphism of schemes) is the thematic example of a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra.</description>

      <title>On the injective self-maps of algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture of Miyanishi says that an endomorphism of an algebraic variety, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, is an automorphism if the endomorphism is injective outside a closed subset of codimension at least $2$. We prove the conjecture in the following cases:
  (1) The variety is non-singular.
  (2) The variety is a surface.
  (3) The variety is locally a complete intersection that is regular in codimension $2$.
  We also discuss a few instances where an endomorphism of a variety, satisfying the hypothesis of the conjecture of Miyanishi, induces an automorphism of the non-singular locus of the variety. Under additional hypotheses, we prove that the conjecture holds when the variety has only isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>The geometry of secondary terms in arithmetic statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we prove the existence of a secondary term for the count of cubic extensions of the function field $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ of fixed absolute norm of discriminant. We show that the number of cubic extensions with absolute norm of discriminant equal to $q^{2N}$ is $c_1 q^{2N} - c_2^{i} q^{5N/3} + O_{\varepsilon}\left(q^{(3/2+\varepsilon)N}\right)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2^{i}$ are explicit constants and $c_2^{i}$ only depends on $N\pmod{3}$.
  This builds on the work of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and Taniguchi-Thorne, who proved the existence of a secondary term for the count of cubic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant. Our approach uses a parametrization of Miranda and Casnati-Ekedahl, which can be seen as a geometric version of the classical parametrization by binary cubic forms used by Davenport-Heilbronn. This allows us to count and sieve for smooth curves embedded in Hirzebruch surfaces, in the same spirit as Zhao and Gunther.</description>

      <title>Optimal Secure Coded Distributed Computation over all Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct optimal secure coded distributed schemes that extend the known optimal constructions over fields of characteristic 0 to all fields. A serendipitous result is that we can encode \emph{all} functions over finite fields with a recovery threshold proportional to the complexity (tensor rank or multiplicative); this is due to the well-known result that all functions over a finite field can be represented as multivariate polynomials (or symmetric tensors). We get that a tensor of order $\ell$ (or a multivariate polynomial of degree $\ell$) can be computed in the faulty network of $N$ nodes setting within a factor of $\ell$ and an additive term depending on the genus of a code with $N$ rational points and distance covering the number of faulty servers; in particular, we present a coding scheme for general matrix multiplication of two $m \times m $ matrices with a recovery threshold of $2 m^{\omega } -1+g$ where $\omega $ is the exponent of matrix multiplication which is optimal for coding schemes using AG codes. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions for which the Hadamard-Shur product of general linear codes gives a similar recovery threshold, which we call \textit{log-additive codes}. Finally, we show that evaluation codes with a \textit{curve degree} function (first defined in [Ben-Sasson et al. (STOC '13)]) that have well-behaved zero sets are log-additive.</description>

Abstract: The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ gives rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, Math. Phys. Ana. Geom., 27 (2024) 19).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On varieties defined over number fields, we consider obstructions to the Hasse principle given by subgroups of their Brauer groups. Given an arbitrary pair of non-zero finite abelian groups $B_0\subset B$, we prove the existence of a variety $X$ such that its unramified Brauer group is isomorphic to $B$ and moreover $B_0$ is the smallest subgroup of $B$ that obstructs the Hasse principle. The concerned varieties are normic bundles over the projective line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between affine and Stein varieties in the context of rigid geometry. We show that the two concepts are much more closely related than in complex geometry, e.g. they are equivalent for surfaces. This rests on the density of algebraic functions in analytic functions. One key ingredient to prove such a density statement is an extension result for Cartier divisors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a smooth projective curve C of genus g over a complete discrete valuation field of characteristic 0 and residue field \Fbar_p. Motivated by Narasimhan and Seshadri's theorem, Faltings asked whether all semistable vector bundles of degree 0 over C_{\C_p} are in the image of the p-adic Simpson correspondence. Works of Deninger-Werner and Xu show that this is equivalent for the vector bundle to having potentially strongly semistable reduction. We prove that if C has good reduction, p&gt;r(r-1) (g-1) and we consider a vector bundle of rank r with stable reduction, the conditions of having potentially strongly semistable reduction and of having strongly semistable reduction are equivalent. In particular, we provide a negative answer to Faltings' question</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Schubert and Richardson varieties in flag manifolds are uniquely determined by their equivariant cohomology classes, as well as a stronger result that replaces Schubert varieties with closures of Bialynicki-Birula cells under suitable conditions. This is used to prove that any two-pointed curve neighborhood representing a quantum cohomology product with a Seidel class is a Schubert variety. We pose a stronger conjecture which implies a Seidel multiplication formula in equivariant quantum K-theory, and prove this conjecture for cominuscule flag varieties.</description>

Abstract: In these memos, we define a pregeometry $\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{S}} ^{alg}$ and a geometry $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{S}} ^{alg}$ which integrate symplectic manifolds with $E_{\infty}$-ring sheaves, enabling the construction of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{S}} ^{alg}$-schemes as structured $\infty$-topoi. Our framework and results establish a profound connection between algebraic invariants and homological properties, opening new pathways for exploring symplectic phenomena through the lens of higher category theory and derived geometry.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript is an extended version of the author's habilitation thesis defended on May 21, 2021 at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. It is devoted to the study of (co)stability of radicals, existence of (co)invariant Levi and Wedderburn decompositions, structure of the corresponding simple algebras and codimension growth of polynomial identities in (co)module algebras over bi- and Hopf algebras and their generalizations. The main difference between this manuscript and the "official" thesis are additional chapters dealing with equivalences of gradings and Hopf algebra (co)actions, V-universal (co)acting bi- and Hopf algebras and related categorical questions.

      <title>Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Activation degree thresholds and expressiveness of polynomial neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of deterministic PIT for $\Sigma^{[k]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\delta]}$ circuits over fields of any characteristic, where $k$ and $\delta$ are bounded. Our main result is a deterministic polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithm for $\Sigma^{[3]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\delta]}$ circuits, under the additional condition that one of the summands at the top $\Sigma$ gate is squarefree.
  Our techniques are purely algebro-geometric: they do not rely on Sylvester--Gallai-type theorems, and our PIT result holds over arbitrary fields.
  The core of our proof is based on the normalization of algebraic varieties. Specifically, we carry out the analysis in the integral closure of a coordinate ring, which enjoys better algebraic properties than the original ring.</description>
