      <title>Well-posedness for 2D non-homogeneous incompressible fluids with general density-dependent odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the initial value problem for a system of equations describing the motion of two-dimensional non-homogeneous incompressible fluids exhibiting odd (non-dissipative) viscosity effects. We consider the complete odd viscous stress tensor with a general density-dependent viscosity coefficient $f(\rho)$. Under suitable assumptions, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ $(s&gt;2)$, for a class of viscosity coefficients covering the particular case $f(\rho)=a\rho^\alpha+b$ for any $(a,b,\alpha)\in\mathbb{R}^3$, generalising the result of Fanelli, Granero-Belinch\'on and Scrobogna, devoted to the case $f(\rho)=\rho$. Additionally, we are able to do so without requiring the initial density variation to belong to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. As a major step of the proof, we exhibit an effective velocity for this sytem, generalising the so-called "Els\"asser formulation" recently derived by Fanelli and Vasseur.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis, maximum principles and shape optimization for nonlinear superposition operators of mixed fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to investigate the spectral properties, maximum principles, and shape optimization problems for a broad class of nonlinear ``superposition operators" defined as continuous superpositions of operators of mixed fractional order, modulated by a signed finite Borel measure on the unit interval. This framework encompasses, as particular cases, mixed local and nonlocal operators such as $-\Delta_p+(-\Delta_p)^s$, finite (possibly infinite) sums of fractional $p$-Laplacians with different orders, as well as operators involving fractional Laplacians with ``wrong" signs.
  The main findings, obtained through variational techniques, concern the spectral analysis of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem associated with general superposition operators with special emphasis on various properties of the first eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenfunction.
  We establish weak and strong maximum principles for positive superposition operators by introducing an appropriate notion of the {\it nonlocal tail} for this class of superposition operators and deriving a logarithmic estimate, both of which are of independent interest. Utilizing these newly developed tools, we further investigate the spectral properties of such superposition operators and prove that the first eigenvalue is isolated. Moreover, we show that the eigenfunctions corresponding to positive eigenvalues are globally bounded and that they change sign when associated with higher eigenvalues. In addition, we demonstrate that the second eigenvalue is well-defined and provide the mountain pass characterization.
  Finally, we address shape optimization problems, in particular, the Faber--Krahn inequality associated with the principal frequency associated with the superposition operators.</description>

      <title>On Hydrodynamic Implosions and the Landau-Coulomb Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous Landau equation with Coulomb potential and derive a new continuation criterion: a smooth solution can be uniquely continued for as long as it remains bounded. This provides, to our knowledge, the first continuation criterion based on a quantity not controlling the mass density. Consequently, we are able to rule out a potential singularity formation scenario known as tail fattening, in which an implosion occurs due to the loss of decay at large velocities.
  More generally, we are able to rule out almost all Type II approximately self-similar blow-up rates, without any assumption of decay on the inner profile, complementing existing Type I blow-up analysis in the literature. Heuristically, this suggests that it should be impossible to directly use the hydrodynamic limit connection with the 3D compressible Euler equations to construct a singular solution to the Landau equation with Coulomb potential. Such a potential implosion scenario -- based on either an isentropic or non-isentropic implosion for the 3D Euler equations -- would naturally result in a Type II approximately self-similar blow-up scenario, falling well within the range our theorem.</description>

      <title>Note on the Rate of Vortex Stretching for Axisymmetric Euler Flows Without Swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03171v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Childress's conjecture proposed in [Phys.D 237(14-17):1921-1925, 2008] on the growth rate of the vorticity maximum for axisymmetric swirl-free Euler flows in three and higher dimensions. We consider the setting that the axial vorticity is non-positive in the upper half space and odd in the last coordinate, which corresponds to the flow setup for head-on collision of anti-parallel vortex rings. By introducing the \emph{generalized vertical moment} and proving its monotonicity, we obtain a lower bound for the growth of the vorticity maximum, contingent on the initial decay rate in the $z$-direction. Specifically, for three-dimensional flows with initial vorticity sufficiently fast decay in $z$, we obtain a lower bound of $t^{\frac{1}{2}-}$, thereby improving upon existing results.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Patterns of Nonlocal Klausmeier Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a nonlocal extension of the Klausmeier vegetation model in $\mathbb{R}^N$ $(N \ge 1)$ that incorporates both local and nonlocal diffusion. The biomass dynamics are driven by a nonlocal convolution operator, representing anomalous and faster dispersal than the standard Laplacian acting on the water component. Using semigroup theory combined with a duality argument, we establish global well-posedness and uniform boundedness of classical solutions. Numerical simulations based on the Finite Difference Method with Forward Euler integration illustrate the qualitative effects of nonlocal diffusion and kernel size on vegetation patterns. The results demonstrate that nonlocal interactions significantly influence the spatial organization of vegetation, producing richer and more coherent structures than those arising in the classical local model.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Asymptotic Equivalence to Barenblatt-type Solutions for the Physical Vacuum Free Boundary Problem of Damped Compressible Euler Equations in M-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the physical vacuum free boundary problem of the damped compressible Euler equations in both 2D and 3D, we prove the global existence of smooth solutions and justify their time-asymptotic equivalence to the corresponding Barenblatt self-similar solutions derived from the porous media equation under Darcy's law approximation, provided the initial data are small perturbations of the Barenblatt solutions. Building on the 3D almost global existence result in [Zeng, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 239, 553--597 (2021)], our key contribution lies in improving the decay rate of the time derivative of the perturbation from $-1$ (as previously established) to $-1-\varepsilon$ for a fixed constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. This critical enhancement ensures time integrability and hence global existence. Together with the previous 1D result in [Luo--Zeng, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 69, 1354--1396 (2016)], the results obtained in this paper provide a complete answer to the question raised in [Liu, T.-P.: Jpn. J. Appl. Math. 13, 25--32 (1996)]. Moreover, we also consider the problem with time-dependent damping of the form $(1+t)^{-\lambda}$ for $0 &lt; \lambda &lt; 1$. Notably, our framework unifies the treatment of both time-dependent ($0 &lt; \lambda &lt; 1$) and time-independent ($\lambda = 0$) damping cases across dimensions. We further quantify the decay rates of the density and velocity, as well as the expansion rate of the physical vacuum boundary.</description>

      <title>The global well-posedness for the Q-tensor model of nematic liquid crystals in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03309v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Q-tensor model of nematic liquid crystals, which couples the Navier-Stokes equations with a parabolic-type equation describing the evolution of the directions of the anisotropic molecules, in the half-space. The aim of this paper is to prove the global well-posedness for the Q-tensor model in the $L_p$-$L_q$ framework. Our proof is based on the Banach fixed point argument. To control the higher-order terms of the solutions, we prove the weighted estimates of the solutions for the linearized problem by the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity. On the other hand, the estimates for the lower-order terms are obtained by the analytic semigroup theory. Here, the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity and the generation of an analytic semigroup are provided by the R-solvability for the resolvent problem arising from the Q-tensor model. It seems to be the first result to discuss the unique existence of a global-in-time solution for the Q-tensor model in the half-space.</description>

      <title>Calibration for minimal surfaces with free boundary and Cheeger-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem of minimal surfaces with free boundary written in the form of a non convex minimization problem. Our aim is to characterize optimal solutions by finding a suitable calibration field. A natural upper bound of the infimum is given by a variant of the Cheeger problem that we solve explicitly proving the optimality thanks to the construction of a cut-locus potential. The comparison with the original problem is then discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Moving boundary problems for a novel extended mKdV equation. Application of Ermakov-Painlev\'e II symmetry reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel extension of the canonical solitonic mKdV equation is introduced which admits hybrid Ermakov-Painlev\'e II symmetry reduction. Application of the latter is made to obtain exact solution of Airy-type to a class of moving boundary problems of Stefan kind for this extended mKdV equation. A reciprocal transformation is then applied to the latter to generate an associated exactly solvable class of moving boundary problems for an extension of a base Casimir member of a compacton hierachy. The extended mKdV equation is shown to be embedded in a range of nonlinear evolution equations with temporal modulation as determined via the action of a class of involutory transformations with origin in Ermakov theory. Associated temporal modulation for the hybrid mKdV and KdV equation as embedded in the classical solitonic Gardner equation is delimited.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish local potential estimates and H\"older estimates for solutions of linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations with the right-hand side being a signed measure, under suitable assumptions on the data. In particular, the interior H\"older estimate holds for an inhomogeneous linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation with right-hand side being the nonnegative divergence of a bounded vector field in all dimensions. As an application, we give a new approach for the interior estimate of the singular Abreu equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosquitoes are vectors of numerous diseases; a strategy to fight the spread of these diseases is to control the vector population. In this article, we focus on the use of the sterile insect technique. Starting from a reaction-diffusion system, we show the existence of 'forced' traveling waves obtained by translating the intervention zone at constant speed. This result is proved in a two-dimensional space by using the radial symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study abelian anyons at the mean-field/almost-bosonic level, whose dynamics are governed by the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger system. We consider the dimensional reduction of this 2D model by introducing an anisotropic trapping potential, and derive an effective 1D model after tracing out the tight confinement direction. The resulting effective dynamics in the loose confinement direction is captured by a quintic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We rigorously establish this dimensional reduction process in the sense of ground state energies and time-dependent solutions, under an $H^2$ well-posedness assumption.</description>

      <title>Critical sinh-Gordon flow with non-negative weight functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is twofold: one one side we introduce and study the properties of a critical sinh-Gordon type flow \begin{equation*} {\frac{\partial}{\partial t}}e^u=\Delta_gu+8\pi\left({\frac{h_1e^u}{\int_{\Sigma}h_1e^udV_g}}-1\right)-\rho_2\left({\frac{h_2e^{-u}}{\int_{\Sigma}h_2e^{-u}dV_g}}-1\right), \end{equation*} where $\rho_2&lt;8\pi$, $h_1,h_2$ are non-negative weight functions and $\Sigma$ is a closed Riemannian surface. Secondly, under suitable geometric conditions, we prove the convergence of the flow to a solution of the critical sinh-Gordon equation, extending the result of Zhou (2008) to the case of non-negative weights. The argument is based on a careful blow-up analysis. Some remarks about a Toda flow are also given.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Grad limit for the inelastic Lorentz gas: Part I. Existence, uniqueness, and rigorous derivation via weak convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a rigorous derivation of the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, in the Boltzmann-Grad limit, from a dissipative, random, Lorentz gas in arbitrary dimensions d $\geq$ 2. Specifically, we consider a microscopic particle system where scatterers are randomly distributed according to a Poisson process, and a tagged light particle undergoes inelastic collisions with the scatterers following a reflection law characterized by a fixed restitution coefficient. We establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation within the class of non-negative Radon measures, assuming that the initial data has a finite exponential moment. We first show that the forward dynamics of the dissipative particle system is globally defined almost surely and then prove the weak$-*$ convergence of the microscopic solution towards the weak solutions of the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, providing an explicit rate of convergence. Furthermore, under the same initial data assumptions, we prove the existence of strong solutions to the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, constructed via a series representation of the solutions.</description>

      <title>HJB equations driven by the Dirichlet-Ferguson Laplacian in Wasserstein-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear and nonlinear PDEs defined on the space of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{T}^d)$ over the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, equipped with the Dirichlet-Ferguson measure $\mathcal{D}$. We first develop an analytic framework based on the Wasserstein-Sobolev space $H^{1,2}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{T}^d), W_2, \mathcal{D})$ associated with the Dirichlet form induced by the infinite-dimensional Laplacian acting on functions of measures. Within this setting, we establish existence and uniqueness results for transport-diffusion and Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space. Our analysis connects the PDE approach with a corresponding interacting particles system providing a probabilistic (Kolmogorov-type) representation of strong solutions. Finally, we extend the theory to semilinear equations and mean-field optimal control problems, together with consistent finite-dimensional approximations.</description>

      <title>How to construct decay rates for kinetic Fokker--Planck equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14506v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time averages for the norm of solutions to kinetic Fokker--Planck equations associated with general Hamiltonians. We provide fully explicit and constructive decay estimates for systems subject to a confining potential, allowing fat-tail, sub-exponential and (super-)exponential local equilibria, which also include the classic Maxwellian case. The key step in our estimates is a modified Poincar\'e inequality, obtained via a Lions--Poincar\'e inequality and an averaging lemma.</description>

      <title>Decay of solutions to one-dimensional inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the decay estimates of global solutions for a class of one-dimensional inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. While most existing results focus on spatial dimensions $d\geq2$, the decay properties in one dimension remain less explored due to the absence of effective Morawetz inequalities. For equations without external potential, by establishing a localized Virial-Morawetz identity, we derive decay estimates in the context of the $L^r$-norm for global solutions within a compact domain as a time subsequence approaches infinity. This decay result can be applied to obtain a criterion for energy scattering. Additionally, by establishing another type of Virial-Morawetz identity under more strict conditions, we demonstrate the decay result for odd solutions for any time sequence that approaches infinity. Utilizing some results about bound states proved by Barry Simon, we also show that similar decay results hold for the global odd solutions of equations with suitable external potentials that contain inverse power type and Yukawa-type potentials.</description>

      <title>Full Benjamin-Feir instability of capillary-gravity Stokes waves in finite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional gravity-capillary water waves equations for a fluid of finite depth $\mathtt{h}&gt;0$ under the combined effects of gravity and surface tension $\kappa \geq 0$. We analyze the linear stability and instability of small-amplitude, $2\pi$-periodic Stokes wave solutions, under the effect of longitudinal long-wave perturbations. The corresponding linearized operator has periodic coefficients and a defective zero eigenvalue of multiplicity four. Using Bloch-Floquet theory, we investigate the associated family of periodic eigenvalue problems. For all surface tension values $\kappa \geq 0$ and depths $\mathtt{h} &gt; 0$, we establish the complete splitting of the four eigenvalues near zero when both the wave amplitude and the Floquet parameter are small. Specifically, we rigorously prove that in the regions of unstable depth and capillarity identified formally by Djordjevic-Redekopp and Ablowitz-Segur in the 1970's, the spectrum of the linearized operator near the origin depicts a "figure 8" pattern.</description>

      <title>Stochastic representation of solutions for the parabolic Cauchy problem with variable exponent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove existence and uniqueness of a bounded viscosity solution for the Cauchy problem of degenerate parabolic equations with variable exponent coefficients. We construct the solution directly using the stochastic representation, then verify it satisfies the Cauchy problem. The corresponding SDE, on the other hand, allows the drift and diffusion coefficients to respond nonlinearly to the current state through the state-dependent variable exponents, and thus, extends the expressive power of classical SDEs to better capture complex dynamics. To validate our theoretical framework, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments comparing finite difference solutions (Crank-Nicolson on logarithmic grids) with Monte Carlo simulations of the SDE.</description>

      <title>On the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac Equation for Hard Potential: Global Existence and Uniqueness, Gaussian Lower Bound, and Moment Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global existence and uniqueness, Gaussian lower bound, and moment estimates in the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Fermi-Dirac particles for hard potential ($0\leq \gamma\leq 2$) with angular cutoff $b$. Our results extend classical results to the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac setting. In detail, (1) we show existence, uniqueness, and $L^1_2$ stability of global-in-time solutions of the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac equation. (2) Assuming the solution is not a saturated equilibrium, we prove creation of a Gaussian lower bound for the solution. (3) We prove creation and propagation of $L^1$ polynomial and exponential moments of the solution under additional assumptions on the angular kernel $b$ and $0&lt;\gamma\leq 2$. (4) Finally, we show propagation of $L^\infty$ Gaussian and polynomial upper bounds when $b$ is constant and $0&lt;\gamma\leq 1$.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectral approach to the spatial discretization of quasilinear hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the rigorous justification of the spatial discretization by means of Fourier spectral methods of quasilinear first-order hyperbolic systems. We provide uniform stability estimates that grant spectral convergence of the (spatially) semi-discretized solutions towards the corresponding continuous solution provided that the underlying system satisfies some suitable structural assumptions. We consider a setting with sharp low-pass filters and a setting with smooth low-pass filters and argue that - at least theoretically - smooth low-pass filters are operable on a larger class of systems. While our theoretical results are supported with numerical evidence, we also pinpoint some behavior of the numerical method that currently has no theoretical explanation.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Approximation of Weak Solutions to Time Dependent Maxwell's Equations with $L^2$-Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Maxwell's equations in conducting media with perfectly conducting boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains, allowing rough material coefficients and $L^2$-data. Our first contribution is a direct proof of well-posedness of the first-order weak formulation, including solution existence and uniqueness, an energy identity, and continuous dependence on the data. The argument uses interior-in-time mollification to show uniqueness while avoiding reflection techniques. Existence is via the well-known Galerkin method (cf.~Duvaut and Lions \cite[Eqns.~(4.31)--(4.32), p.~346; Thm.~4.1]{GDuvaut_JLLions_1976a}). For completeness, and to make the paper self-contained, a complete proof has been provided.
  Our second contribution is a structure-preserving semi-discrete finite element method based on the N\'ed\'elec/Raviart--Thomas de Rham complex. The scheme preserves a discrete Gauss law for all times and satisfies a continuous-in-time energy identity with stability for nonnegative conductivity. With a divergence-free initialization of the magnetic field (via potential reconstruction or constrained $L^2$ projection), we prove convergence of the semi-discrete solutions to the unique weak solution as the mesh is refined. The analysis mostly relies on projector consistency, weak-* compactness in time-bounded $L^2$ spaces, and identification of time derivatives in dual spaces.</description>
