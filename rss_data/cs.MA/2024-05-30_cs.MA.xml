      <title>Resilient Average Consensus with Adversaries via Distributed Detection and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of resilient average consensus in multi-agent systems where some of the agents are subject to failures or attacks. The objective of resilient average consensus is for non-faulty/normal agents to converge to the average of their initial values despite the erroneous effects from malicious agents. To this end, we propose a successful distributed iterative resilient average consensus algorithm for the multi-agent networks with general directed topologies. The proposed algorithm has two parts at each iteration: detection and averaging. For the detection part, we propose two distributed algorithms and one of them can detect malicious agents with only the information from direct in-neighbors. For the averaging part, we extend the applicability of an existing averaging algorithm where normal agents can remove the effects from malicious agents so far, after they are detected. Another important feature of our method is that it can handle the case where malicious agents are neighboring and collaborating with each other to mislead the normal ones from averaging. This case cannot be solved by existing detection approaches in related literature. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient in storage usage especially for large-scale networks as each agent only requires the values of neighbors within two hops. Lastly, numerical examples are given to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Act Natural! Projecting Autonomous System Trajectories Into Naturalistic Behavior Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents operating around human actors must consider how their behaviors might affect those humans, even when not directly interacting with them. To this end, it is often beneficial to be predictable and appear naturalistic. Existing methods to address this problem use human actor intent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely capture all possible motivations for human behavior or require significant amounts of data. In contrast, we propose a technique for modeling naturalistic behavior as a set of convex hulls computed over a relatively small dataset of human behavior. Given this set, we design an optimization-based filter which projects arbitrary trajectories into it to make them more naturalistic for autonomous agents to execute while also satisfying dynamics constraints. We demonstrate our methods on real-world human driving data from the inD intersection dataset (Bock et al., 2020).</description>

      <title>Normative Modules: A Generative Agent Architecture for Learning Norms that Supports Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative agents, which implement behaviors using a large language model (LLM) to interpret and evaluate an environment, has demonstrated the capacity to solve complex tasks across many social and technological domains. However, when these agents interact with other agents and humans in presence of social structures such as existing norms, fostering cooperation between them is a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we develop the framework of a 'Normative Module': an architecture designed to enhance cooperation by enabling agents to recognize and adapt to the normative infrastructure of a given environment. We focus on the equilibrium selection aspect of the cooperation problem and inform our agent design based on the existence of classification institutions that implement correlated equilibrium to provide effective resolution of the equilibrium selection problem. Specifically, the normative module enables agents to learn through peer interactions which of multiple candidate institutions in the environment, does a group treat as authoritative. By enabling normative competence in this sense, agents gain ability to coordinate their sanctioning behaviour; coordinated sanctioning behaviour in turn shapes primary behaviour within a social environment, leading to higher average welfare. We design a new environment that supports institutions and evaluate the proposed framework based on two key criteria derived from agent interactions with peers and institutions: (i) the agent's ability to disregard non-authoritative institutions and (ii) the agent's ability to identify authoritative institutions among several options. We show that these capabilities allow the agent to achieve more stable cooperative outcomes compared to baseline agents without the normative module, paving the way for research in a new avenue of designing environments and agents that account for normative infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Can We Enhance the Quality of Mobile Crowdsensing Data Without Ground Truth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has emerged as a prominent trend across various domains. However, ensuring the quality of the sensing data submitted by mobile users (MUs) remains a complex and challenging problem. To address this challenge, an advanced method is required to detect low-quality sensing data and identify malicious MUs that may disrupt the normal operations of an MCS system. Therefore, this article proposes a prediction- and reputation-based truth discovery (PRBTD) framework, which can separate low-quality data from high-quality data in sensing tasks. First, we apply a correlation-focused spatial-temporal transformer network to predict the ground truth of the input sensing data. Then, we extract the sensing errors of the data as features based on the prediction results to calculate the implications among the data. Finally, we design a reputation-based truth discovery (TD) module for identifying low-quality data with their implications. Given sensing data submitted by MUs, PRBTD can eliminate the data with heavy noise and identify malicious MUs with high accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PRBTD outperforms the existing methods in terms of identification accuracy and data quality enhancement.</description>

      <title>Distributed Management of Fluctuating Energy Resources in Dynamic Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern power systems integrate renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) as an environment-friendly enhancement to meet the ever-increasing demands. However, the inherent unreliability of renewable energy renders developing DER management algorithms imperative. We study the energy-sharing problem in a system consisting of several DERs. Each agent harvests and distributes renewable energy in its neighborhood to optimize the network's performance while minimizing energy waste. We model this problem as a bandit convex optimization problem with constraints that correspond to each node's limitations for energy production. We propose distributed decision-making policies to solve the formulated problem, where we utilize the notion of dynamic regret as the performance metric. We also include an adjustment strategy in our developed algorithm to reduce the constraint violations. Besides, we design a policy that deals with the non-stationary environment. Theoretical analysis shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments using a real-world dataset show superior performance of our proposal compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Inverse Concave-Utility Reinforcement Learning is Inverse Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We present initial query and sample complexity results for the I-CURL problem under assumptions such as Lipschitz-continuity. Finally, we outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.</description>

      <title>On the external concurrency of current BDI frameworks for MAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The execution of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) can be practically implemented on top of low-level concurrency mechanisms that impact on efficiency, determinism, and reproducibility. We argue that developers should specify the MAS behaviour independently of the execution model, and choose or configure the concurrency model later on, according to the specific needs of their target domain, leaving the MAS specification unaffected. We identify patterns for mapping the agent execution over the underlying concurrency abstractions, and investigate which concurrency models are supported by some of the most commonly used BDI platforms. Although most frameworks support multiple concurrency models, we find that they mostly hide them under the hood, making them opaque to the developer, and actually limiting the possibility of fine-tuning the MAS.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Matching Bandit For Two-Sided Online Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-sided online matching platforms are employed in various markets. However, agents' preferences in the current market are usually implicit and unknown, thus needing to be learned from data. With the growing availability of dynamic side information involved in the decision process, modern online matching methodology demands the capability to track shifting preferences for agents based on contextual information. This motivates us to propose a novel framework for this dynamic online matching problem with contextual information, which allows for dynamic preferences in matching decisions. Existing works focus on online matching with static preferences, but this is insufficient: the two-sided preference changes as soon as one side's contextual information updates, resulting in non-static matching. In this paper, we propose a dynamic matching bandit algorithm to adapt to this problem. The key component of the proposed dynamic matching algorithm is an online estimation of the preference ranking with a statistical guarantee. Theoretically, we show that the proposed dynamic matching algorithm delivers an agent-optimal stable matching result with high probability. In particular, we prove a logarithmic regret upper bound $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ and construct a corresponding instance-dependent matching regret lower bound. In the experiments, we demonstrate that dynamic matching algorithm is robust to various preference schemes, dimensions of contexts, reward noise levels, and context variation levels, and its application to a job-seeking market further demonstrates the practical usage of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Coupling OMNeT++ and mosaik for integrated Co-Simulation of ICT-reliant Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy resources requires so-called smart grid services for monitoring, control and automation tasks. Simulation environments are vital for evaluating and developing innovative solutions and algorithms. Especially in smart energy systems, we face a variety of heterogeneous simulators representing, e.g., power grids, analysis or control components and markets. The co-simulation framework mosaik can be used to orchestrate the data exchange and time synchronization between individual simulators. So far, the underlying communication infrastructure has often been assumed to be optimal and therefore, the influence of e.g., communication delays has been neglected. This paper presents the first results of the project cosima, which aims at connecting the communication simulator OMNeT++ to the co-simulation framework mosaik to analyze the resilience and robustness of smart grid services, e.g., multi-agent-based services with respect to adaptivity, scalability, extensibility and usability. This facilitates simulations with realistic communication technologies (such as 5G) and the analysis of dynamic communication characteristics by simulating multiple messages. We show the functionality and benefits of cosima in experiments with 50 agents.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Competing Matching Recommendation Markets With Quota and Complementary Preferences Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new recommendation algorithm for addressing the problem of two-sided online matching markets with complementary preferences and quota constraints, where agents' preferences are unknown a priori and must be learned from data. The presence of mixed quota and complementary preferences constraints can lead to instability in the matching process, making this problem challenging to solve. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the problem as a bandit learning framework and propose the Multi-agent Multi-type Thompson Sampling (MMTS) algorithm. The algorithm combines the strengths of Thompson Sampling for exploration with a new double matching technique to provide a stable matching outcome. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of MMTS as it can achieve stability and has a total $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(Q{\sqrt{K_{\max}T}})$-Bayesian regret with high probability, which exhibits linearity with respect to the total firm's quota $Q$, the square root of the maximum size of available type workers $\sqrt{K_{\max}}$ and time horizon $T$. In addition, simulation studies also demonstrate MMTS's effectiveness in various settings. We provide code used in our experiments \url{https://github.com/Likelyt/Double-Matching}.</description>
