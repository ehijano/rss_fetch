      <title>Quantum Vortices in Curved Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control over the geometry and topology of quantum systems is crucial for advancing novel quantum technologies. This work provides a synthesis of recent insights into the behaviour of quantum vortices within atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subject to curved geometric constraints. We highlight the significant impact of the curvature on the condensate density and phase distribution, particularly in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides for different angular momentum states. An engineered periodic transport of the quantized vorticity between density-coupled ring-shaped condensates is discussed. The significant role of curved geometry in shaping the dynamics of rotational Josephson vortices in long atomic Josephson junctions is illustrated for the system of vertically stacked toroidal condensates. Different methods for the controlled creation of rotational Josephson vortices in coupled ring systems are described in the context of the formation of long-lived vortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs with cylindrical geometry. Future directions of explorations of vortices in curved geometries with implications for quantum information processing and sensing technologies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reservoir Computing Using Bose-Einstein Condensate with damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a type of machine learning in which the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems contributes to performance. In this study, we employ the Bose-Einstein condensate of dilute atomic gas as a reservoir to examine the effect of reduction in the number of condensed particles, damping, and the nonlinearity of the dynamics. It is observed that for the condensate to function as a reservoir, the physical system requires damping. The nonlinearity of the dynamics improves the performance of the reservoir, while the reduction in the number of condensed particles degrades the performance.</description>

      <title>Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective field theory to nonuniversal equation of state of an ultracold Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) serves as a cornerstone in elucidating the properties of quantum many-body systems. A recent highlight along this research line consists of the derivation of the nonuniversal Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) EOS for an ultracold quantum bosonic gas with finite-range interatomic interactions using one-loop effective path-integral field theory. The purpose of this work is to extend Salasnich's pioneering work to uncover beyond-LHY corrections to the EOS by employing the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective field theory, leveraging its two-loop approximation. In this end, we expand Salasnich's remarkable findings of EOS to the next leading order characterized by $\left(\rho a_{\text{s}}^{3}\right)^{2}$, with $\rho$ and $a_{\text{s}}$ being the density and the $s$-wave scattering length. Notably, we derive analytical expressions for quantum depletion and chemical potential, representing the next-to-LHY corrections to nonuniversal EOS induced by finite-range effects. Moreover, we propose an experimental protocol of observing the nonuniversal next-to-LHY corrections to the EOS by calculating fractional frequency shifts in the breathing modes. The nonuniversal beyond-LHY EOS in this work paves the way of using LHY effects in quantum simulation experiments and for investigations beyond the LHY regime.</description>

      <title>Multipole quantum droplets in quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum droplets emerging in a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric mixture of two atomic species with different intra-component coupling constants. We find that such mixtures support a rich variety of multipole quantum droplets, where the macroscopic wavefunction of one component changes its sign and features distinctive multipole structure, while the wavefunction of another component does not have zeros. Such multipole droplets have no counterparts in the reduced single-component model frequently used to describe symmetric one-dimensional mixtures. We study transformations of multipole states upon variation of the chemical potential of each component and demonstrate that quantum droplets can split into separated fundamental states, transform into flat-top multipoles, or into multipole component coupled to flat-top state with several humps on it, akin to anti-dark solitons. Multipole quantum droplets described here are stable in large part of their existence domain. Our findings essentially broaden the family of quantum droplet states emerging in the beyond-meanfield regime and open the way for observation of such heterostructured states in Bose-Bose mixtures.</description>

      <title>Comparison of renormalized interactions using one-dimensional few-body systems as a testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though the one-dimensional contact interaction requires no regularization, renormalization methods have been shown to improve the convergence of numerical ab initio calculations considerably. In this work, we compare and contrast these methods: `the running coupling constant' where the two-body ground state energy is used as a renormalization condition, and two effective interaction approaches that include information about the ground as well as excited states. In particular, we calculate the energies and densities of few-fermion systems in a harmonic oscillator with the configuration interaction method, and compare the results based upon renormalized and bare interactions. We find that the use of the running coupling constant instead of the bare interaction improves convergence significantly. A comparison with an effective interaction, which is designed to reproduce the relative part of the energy spectrum of two particles, showed a similar improvement. The effective interaction provides an additional improvement if the center-of-mass excitations are included in the construction. Finally, we discuss the transformation of observables alongside the renormalization of the potential, and demonstrate that this might be an essential ingredient for accurate numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral function and nonequilibrium dynamics of the strongly interacting Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical results on the correlation functions of strongly correlated many-body systems are rare in the literature and their importance cannot be overstated. We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and temperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting one-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping potential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very easily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications of our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems with harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for both fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator state.</description>

      <title>Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of quantum droplets at finite temperature in attractive Bose mixtures subject to a strong transverse harmonic confinement. By means of exact path-integral Monte Carlo methods we determine the equilibrium density of the gas and the liquid as well as the pressure vs. volume dependence along isothermal curves. Results for the equation of state and for the gas-liquid coexistence region in quasi-2D configurations are compared with calculations in strictly two dimensions, finding excellent agreement. Within the pure 2D model we explore the relevance of the quantum scale anomaly and we determine the critical interaction strength for the occurrence of the first-order gas to liquid transition. Furthermore, we find that the superfluid response develops suddenly, following the density jump from the gas to the liquid state.</description>

      <title>Vortex to Rotons Transition in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental advancements enabled the creation of various systems exhibiting superfluid behavior, with one notable achievement being the development of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). When confined along one or more spatial dimensions, these condensates exhibit a dispersion relation reminiscent of superfluid liquid helium, featuring a roton-like minimum. This study investigates the existence of two-dimensional solitary waves in dBECs characterised by topological defects (quantised vortices) and their transition to vortex-free Jones-Roberts solitons. The explicit connection between solitary waves and roton excitation is demonstrated, supporting Feynman's hypothesis regarding the nature of rotons as fading vortex excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks and correlated dynamics in an interacting synthetic Rydberg lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent dynamics of interacting quantum particles plays a central role in the study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the pursuit of quantum information processors. Here, we present the state-space of interacting Rydberg atoms as a synthetic landscape on which to control and observe coherent and correlated dynamics. With full control of the coupling strengths and energy offsets between the pairs of sites in a nine-site synthetic lattice, we realize quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and dynamics in an Escher-type "continuous staircase". In the interacting regime, we observe correlated quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and confinement of particle pairs. Additionally, we simultaneously tilt our lattice both up and down to achieve coherent pair oscillations. When combined with a few straightforward upgrades, this work establishes synthetic Rydberg lattices of interacting atom arrays as a promising platform for programmable quantum many-body dynamics with access to features that are difficult to realize in real-space lattices.</description>
