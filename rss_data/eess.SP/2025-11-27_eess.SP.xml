      <title>WiRainbow: Single-Antenna Direction-Aware Wi-Fi Sensing via Dispersion Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A Fully Multivariate Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis Method for Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully multivariate generalization of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and leverage it to develop a fault diagnosis framework for multichannel machine vibration data. We introduce a novel covariance-weighted $L_{pq}$ matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance to define a fully multivariate fluctuation function that uniquely captures cross-channel dependencies and variance biases in multichannel vibration data. This formulation, termed FM-MFDFA, allows for a more accurate characterization of the multiscale structure of multivariate signals. To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA. Results on wind turbine gearbox data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional MFDFA approaches by effectively distinguishing between healthy and faulty machine states, even under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Guided Water-Level Estimation for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance of a Modified Skin Temperature Sensor for Lower Limb Prostheses: An Experimental Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current rehabilitation of lower limb prostheses has significant challenges, especially with skin conditions, irritation and discomfort. Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful. The system would help the user and orthopedic technician to provide feedback and changes that might be required in the prosthesis. Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Assessment of Concrete Slab Integrity via Impact-Echo Signals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.</description>

      <title>2D Sparse Array Design via Reweighted L1 Second Order Cone Programming for 3D Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.</description>

      <title>Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES) for AI-assisted RFIC and Microwave Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.</description>

      <title>Phase-Aware Code-Aided EM Algorithm for Blind Channel Estimation in PSK-Modulated OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.</description>

      <title>Blind Turbo Demodulation for Differentially Encoded OFDM with 2D Trellis Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.</description>

      <title>Group-wise Semantic Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-User Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Design Of A Communication System To Send Text Using Lora At 400 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages.
  The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure.
  Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) waveform is analyzed under minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization in two domains; namely, the affine domain and the filtered time-domain (TD). Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent</description>

      <title>Optimal Bit Detection in Thermal Noise Communication Systems Under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal noise communication (TNC) enables ultra-low-power wireless links for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by modulating the variance of thermal noise, rather than using active carriers. Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Access Point Coordination in Agentic AI Wi-Fi with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Direct Calibration Algorithm for ADC Interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel direct calibration algorithm to address phase delay, gain, and offset mismatches in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) time interleaving systems. These mismatches, common in high-speed data acquisition, degrade system performance and signal integrity, particularly in applications such as radio astronomy and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Our proposed algorithm uses a sinusoidal reference signal and Fourier analysis to isolate and correct each type of mismatch, providing a computationally efficient solution. Extensive numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness and demonstrate its ability to significantly enhance signal reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods. This work provides a robust and scalable solution for maintaining signal fidelity in interleaved ADC systems and has broad applications in fields that require high-speed data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Design and Measurements of mmWave FMCW Radar Based Non-Contact Multi-Patient Heart Rate and Breath Rate Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show &gt;97% and &gt;93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.</description>

      <title>A 0.32 mm$^2$ 100 Mb/s 223 mW ASIC in 22FDX for Joint Jammer Mitigation, Channel Estimation, and SIMO Data Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first single-input multiple-output (SIMO) receiver ASIC that jointly performs jammer mitigation, channel estimation, and data detection. The ASIC implements a recent algorithm called siMultaneous mitigAtion, Estimation, and Detection (MAED). MAED mitigates smart jammers via spatial filtering using a nonlinear optimization problem that unifies jammer estimation and nulling, channel estimation, and data detection to achieve state-of-the-art error-rate performance under jamming. The design supports eight receive antennas and enables mitigation of smart jammers as well as of barrage jammers. The ASIC is fabricated in 22 nm FD-SOI, has a core area of 0.32 mm$^2$, and achieves a throughput of 100 Mb/s at 223 mW, thus delivering 3$\times$ higher per-user throughput and 4.5$\times$ higher area efficiency than the state-of-the-art jammer-resilient detector.</description>

      <title>LCB-CV-UNet: Enhanced Detector for High Dynamic Range Radar Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High Dynamic Range (HDR) radar signals. Initially, a hardware-efficient, plug-and-play module named Logarithmic Connect Block (LCB) is proposed as a phase coherence preserving solution to address the inherent challenges in handling HDR features. Then, we propose the Dual Hybrid Dataset Construction method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset, approximating typical HDR signal scenarios with adjustable target distributions. Simulation results show about 1% total detection probability improvement with under 0.9% computational complexity added compared with the baseline. Furthermore, it excels 5% over the baseline at the range in 11-13 dB signal-to-noise ratio typical for urban targets. Finally, the real experiment validates the practicality of our model.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems-Enabled Multi-User Communications: Transmission Structures and Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent an innovative advancement in flexible-antenna technologies, aimed at significantly improving wireless communications by ensuring reliable line-of-sight connections and dynamic antenna array reconfigurations. To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user communications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching (WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing and pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast communication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special case. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission structure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve the highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and fractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is invoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented Lagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling constraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting augmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is extended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS structure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the large-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1) the MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for unicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap between WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are geographically isolated.</description>

      <title>Graphon Signal Processing for Spiking and Biological Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) extends classical signal processing to signals defined on graphs, enabling filtering, spectral analysis, and sampling of data generated by networks of various kinds. Graphon Signal Processing (GnSP) develops this framework further by employing the theory of graphons. Graphons are measurable functions on the unit square that represent graphs and limits of convergent graph sequences. The use of graphons provides stability of GSP methods to stochastic variability in network data and improves computational efficiency for very large networks. We use GnSP to address the stimulus identification problem (SIP) in computational and biological neural networks. The SIP is an inverse problem that aims to infer the unknown stimulus s from the observed network output f. We first validate the approach in spiking neural network simulations and then analyze calcium imaging recordings. Graphon-based spectral projections yield trial-invariant, lowdimensional embeddings that improve stimulus classification over Principal Component Analysis and discrete GSP baselines. The embeddings remain stable under variations in network stochasticity, providing robustness to different network sizes and noise levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GnSP to biological neural networks, opening new avenues for graphon-based analysis in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Control of Acoustic Emissions from Marine Energy Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental licensing related to underwater acoustic emissions represents a critical bottleneck for the commercial deployment of marine renewable energy. This study presents a control engineering framework to mitigate acoustic risks from tidal current converters without compromising project viability. A MATLAB/Simulink model of a tidal current converter was utilised to evaluate two distinct mitigation tiers: (1) architectural modification, comparing a geared induction generator against a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator, and (2) operational control, analysing the impact of switching frequencies and maximum power point tracking coefficient tuning. Results indicate that lowering switching frequencies is ineffective, increasing power electronic losses by over 2000% with negligible acoustic benefit. Conversely, the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator architecture reduced sound pressure levels, effectively eliminating mechanical tonal noise. For existing geared systems, de-tuning the maximum power point tracking coefficient by a factor of 1.2 reduced the probability of exceeding temporary threshold shift limits for marine mammals, with a quantified energy yield reduction of 3.58%. These findings propose a hierarchical mitigation strategy: selecting direct-drive topologies for acoustically sensitive sites, and utilising maximum power point tracking coefficient based power curtailment as a transient operational mode during critical biological migration periods.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.</description>
