      <title>Where is information research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a preliminary investigation into the current scope of research in information management, adopting a conceptual approach derived from previous work by Hj{\o}rland in information science and by Palvia in information systems. We created a data-set of 107 articles resulting from a search in Web of Science, using the search strategy of the term information management in the titles of articles, and then restricting the analysis to those journals we identified as having an information science orientation, rather than an information systems orientation. The analysis reveals the International Journal of Information Management as the most significant journal in the field, but also draws attention to the rise of interest in the field through contributions to two Brazilian journals and one Spanish journal. The thematic analysis revealed that the dominant research themes from the information science perspective were empirical user studies, studies of the structural and institutional approach, and information system usage and adoption. Further work will be undertaken to explore the relevance of the approach in the analysis of other document sets from areas such as health care, construction and engineering.</description>

      <title>Scientometric Analysis of the German IR Community within TREC &amp; CLEF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within this study, the influence of the German Information Retrieval community on the retrieval campaigns Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) between 2000 and 2022 was analyzed based on metadata provided by OpenAlex and further metadata extracted with the GROBID framework from the publication's full texts. The analysis was conducted at the institutional and researcher levels. It was found that the German IR community, both on the author and institution level, mainly contributed to CLEF. Furthermore, it was shown that productivity follows the assumptions made by Lotka's Law.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Factors Paper-Reviewer Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in paper submissions to academic conferences, the need for automated and accurate paper-reviewer matching is more critical than ever. Previous efforts in this area have considered various factors to assess the relevance of a reviewer's expertise to a paper, such as the semantic similarity, shared topics, and citation connections between the paper and the reviewer's previous works. However, most of these studies focus on only one factor, resulting in an incomplete evaluation of the paper-reviewer relevance. To address this issue, we propose a unified model for paper-reviewer matching that jointly considers semantic, topic, and citation factors. To be specific, during training, we instruction-tune a contextualized language model shared across all factors to capture their commonalities and characteristics; during inference, we chain the three factors to enable step-by-step, coarse-to-fine search for qualified reviewers given a submission. Experiments on four datasets (one of which is newly contributed by us) spanning various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, information retrieval, and data mining consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Chain-of-Factors model in comparison with state-of-the-art paper-reviewer matching methods and scientific pre-trained language models.</description>
