      <title>A Fusion-Driven Approach of Attention-Based CNN-BiLSTM for Protein Family Classification -- ProFamNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced automated AI techniques allow us to classify protein sequences and discern their biological families and functions. Conventional approaches for classifying these protein families often focus on extracting N-Gram features from the sequences while overlooking crucial motif information and the interplay between motifs and neighboring amino acids. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been applied to amino acid and motif data, even with a limited dataset of well-characterized proteins, resulting in improved performance. This study presents a model for classifying protein families using the fusion of 1D-CNN, BiLSTM, and an attention mechanism, which combines spatial feature extraction, long-term dependencies, and context-aware representations. The proposed model (ProFamNet) achieved superior model efficiency with 450,953 parameters and a compact size of 1.72 MB, outperforming the state-of-the-art model with 4,578,911 parameters and a size of 17.47 MB. Further, we achieved a higher F1 score (98.30% vs. 97.67%) with more instances (271,160 vs. 55,077) in fewer training epochs (25 vs. 30).</description>

      <title>The Aging Metabolite Database with Summary Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of metabolomic papers are published each year, creating challenges for scientists to combine results and yield conclusions that span across studies. Literature databases such as the Human Metabolome Database provide summaries of metabolite detections and relevance, but it does not focus on specific processes, such as aging. Another database, MetaboAge, focuses specifically on how metabolite concentrations change with age. However, both databases can only search metabolites individually. Both databases lack an easily displayed overview of all the information provided, and they do not combine datasets to validate results across studies. This project aims to design a database from data extracted from the literature that cover studies across species, include query options, and combine data to get statistically sound results. The Aging Metabolite Database summarizes aging-related information for almost 2,700 non-unique metabolites and was created from 104 publications. A sub-database was created to focus on metabolite plasma levels in human aging and, including metadata from 27 papers. This resulted in 6,500 data points from 1,167 metabolites. 12 of these papers were selected for the summary results section of the database. Across these 12 studies, 53 common metabolites were reported and can be queried in 163 summary statistics, for example by age and sex. Summary statistics are provided for all aging and sex combinations. This information assists users to compare the results of their own age-related studies to published literature. Combining multiple datasets results in a more solid understanding of validated metabolic changes during the aging process.</description>

      <title>Proteome-wide prediction of mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism underlying genetic diseases using structural interactomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic diseases can be classified according to their modes of inheritance and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant disorders often result from DNA variants that cause loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or dominant-negative effects, while autosomal recessive diseases are primarily linked to loss-of-function variants. In this study, we introduce a graph-of-graphs approach that leverages protein-protein interaction networks and high-resolution protein structures to predict the mode of inheritance of diseases caused by variants in autosomal genes, and to classify dominant-associated proteins based on their functional effect. Our approach integrates graph neural networks, structural interactomics and topological network features to provide proteome-wide predictions, thus offering a scalable method for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Critical transitions in pancreatic islets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calcium signals in pancreatic beta-cells collectives show a sharp transition from uncorrelated to correlated state resembling a phase transition as the slowly increasing glucose concentration crosses the tipping point. However, the exact nature or the order of this phase transition is not well understood. Using confocal microscopy to record the collective calcium activation of beta-cells in an intact islet under changing glucose concentration in increasing and then decreasing way, we first show that in addition to the sharp transition, the coordinated calcium response exhibits a hysteresis indicating a critical, first order transition. A network model of beta-cells combining link selection and coordination mechanisms capture the observed hysteresis loop and the critical nature of the transition. Our results point towards the understanding the role of islets as tipping elements in the pancreas that interconnected by perfusion, diffusion and innervation cause the tipping dynamics and abrupt insulin release.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary game theory approach to modeling behavioral interaction in disclosing infection begins with an outbreak: COVID-19 as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of people worldwide prompted the implementation of a range of preventive measures at local, national, and international levels. Early in the outbreak, before the vaccine became accessible, voluntary quarantine and social isolation emerged as crucial strategies to curb the spread of infection. In this research, we present a game-theoretic model to elucidate the voluntary disclosure of exposure to infected individuals within communities. By employing a fractional derivative approach to illustrate disease propagation within the compartmental model, we determine the minimum level of voluntary disclosure required to disrupt the chain of transmission and allow the epidemic to fade. Our findings suggest that higher transmission rates and increased perceived severity of infection change the externality of disclosing infected exposure, thereby contributing to a rise in the proportion of individuals opting for quarantine and reducing disease incidence. We estimate behavioral parameters and transmission rates by fitting the model to hospitalized cases in Chile, South America. Results from our paper underscore the potential for public health authorities to influence and regulate voluntary disclosure of infection during emerging outbreaks through effective risk communication, emphasizing the severity of the disease, and providing accurate information about hospital capacity to the public.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical representations of biochemical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. These visualizations lack a formal framework, so that the analysis of such networks through modelling and simulation is an entirely separate task, determined by a chosen modelling framework (e.g. differential equations, Petri nets, stochastic processes, graphs). A second research gap is the lack of a mathematical framework to compose network representations. The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction.
  We address these challenges by introducing a category-theoretic formalism for biochemical processes visualised using SBGN Process Description (SBGN-PD) language. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category and demonstrate its horizontal 1-morphisms as SBGN Process Descriptions. We obtain organisational principles such as 'compositionality' (building a large SBGN-PD from smaller ones) and 'zooming-out' (abstracting away details in biochemical processes) defined in category-theoretic terms. We also formally investigate how a particular portion of a biochemical network influences the remaining portion of the network and vice versa. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings using standard SBGN-PD examples.</description>

      <title>An application of node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality to a protein complex hypernetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of graph centrality measures applied to biological networks, such as protein interaction networks, underpins much research into identifying key players within biological processes. This approach however is restricted to dyadic interactions and it is well-known that in many instances interactions are polyadic. In this study we illustrate the merit of using hypergraph centrality applied to a hypernetwork as an alternative. Specifically, we review and propose an extension to a recently introduced node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality model which provides mutually dependent node and edge centralities. A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae protein complex hypernetwork is used as an example application with nodes representing proteins and hyperedges representing protein complexes. The resulting rankings of the nodes and edges are considered to see if they provide insight into the essentiality of the proteins and complexes. We find that certain variations of the model predict essentiality more accurately and that the degree-based variation illustrates that the centrality-lethality rule extends to a hypergraph setting. In particular, through exploitation of the models flexibility, we identify small sets of proteins densely populated with essential proteins. One of the key advantages of applying this model to a protein complex hypernetwork is that it also provides a classification method for protein complexes, unlike previous approaches which are only concerned with classifying proteins.</description>

      <title>RawAlign: Accurate, Fast, and Scalable Raw Nanopore Signal Mapping via Combining Seeding and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencers generate raw electrical signals representing the contents of a biological sequence molecule passing through the nanopore. These signals can be analyzed directly, avoiding basecalling entirely. We observe that while existing proposals for raw signal analysis typically do well in all metrics for small genomes (e.g., viral genomes), they all perform poorly for large genomes (e.g., the human genome). Our goal is to analyze raw nanopore signals in an accurate, fast, and scalable manner. To this end, we propose RawAlign, the first work to integrate fine-grained signal alignment into the state-of-the-art raw signal mapper. To enable accurate, fast, and scalable mapping with alignment, RawAlign implements three algorithmic improvements and hardware acceleration via a vectorized implementation of fine-grained alignment. Together, these significantly reduce the overhead of typically computationally expensive fine-grained alignment. Our extensive evaluations on different use cases and various datasets show RawAlign provides 1) the most accurate mapping for large genomes and 2) and on-par performance compared to RawHash (between 0.80x-1.08x), while achieving better performance than UNCALLED and Sigmap by on average (geo. mean) 2.83x and 2.06x, respectively.

      <title>CPE-Pro: A Structure-Sensitive Deep Learning Method for Protein Representation and Origin Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structures are important for understanding their functions and interactions. Currently, many protein structure prediction methods are enriching the structure database. Discriminating the origin of structures is crucial for distinguishing between experimentally resolved and computationally predicted structures, evaluating the reliability of prediction methods, and guiding downstream biological studies. Building on works in structure prediction, We developed a structure-sensitive supervised deep learning model, Crystal vs Predicted Evaluator for Protein Structure (CPE-Pro), to represent and discriminate the origin of protein structures. CPE-Pro learns the structural information of proteins and captures inter-structural differences to achieve accurate traceability on four data classes, and is expected to be extended to more. Simultaneously, we utilized Foldseek to encode protein structures into "structure-sequences" and trained a protein Structural Sequence Language Model, SSLM. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that, compared to large-scale protein language models pre-trained on vast amounts of amino acid sequences, the "structure-sequence" enables the language model to learn more informative protein features, enhancing and optimizing structural representations. We have provided the code, model weights, and all related materials on https://github.com/GouWenrui/CPE-Pro-main.git.</description>
