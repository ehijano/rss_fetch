      <title>Differential phase contrast from electrons that cause inner shell ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) imaging, in which deviations in the bright field beam are in proportion to the electric field, has been extensively studied in the context of pure elastic scattering. Here we discuss differential phase contrast formed from core-loss scattered electrons, i.e. those that have caused inner shell ionization of atoms in the specimen, using a transition potential approach for which we study the convergence properties. In the phase object approximation, we show formally that this is mainly a result of preservation of elastic contrast. Through simulation we demonstrate that whether the inelastic DPC images show element selective contrast depends on the spatial range of the ionization interaction, and specifically that when the energy loss is low the delocalisation can lead to contributions to the contrast from atoms other than that ionized. We further show that inelastic DPC images remain robustly interpretable to larger thicknesses than is the case for elastic DPC images, owing to the incoherence of the inelastic wavefields, though subtleties due to channelling remain.</description>

      <title>There Are Two Distinct Photon Gases Present Inside Every Solar Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has gradually been recognized that incoming sunlight can be trapped within a high refractive index semiconductor, n~3.5, owing to the narrow 16degree escape cone. The solar light inside a semiconductor is 4n^2 times brighter than incident sunlight. This is called light trapping and has increased the theoretical and practical efficiency of solar panels. But there is a second photon gas of equal importance that has been overlooked. Inside every forward-biased solar cell there is a gas of infrared luminescence photons, also trapped by total internal reflection. We introduce the idea of super-equilibrium, when the luminescence photon gas freely exchanges energy with the two quasi-Fermi levels.
  Nonetheless, the loss of a single photon from either gas is equivalent to the loss of a precious minority carrier. Therefore optical modeling &amp; design becomes equally important as electron-hole modeling in high efficiency solar cells. It becomes possible to approach the idealistic Shockley-Queisser limit, by proper material selection and design of the solar cell optics.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of E. coli bacteria moving in coupled wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization plays a crucial role in the dynamics of living organisms, from fireflies flashing in unison to pacemaker cells that jointly generate heartbeats. Uncovering the mechanism behind these phenomena requires an understanding of individual biological oscillators and the coupling forces between them. Here, we develop a single-cell assay that studies rhythmic behavior in the motility of individual E.coli cells that can be mutually synchronized. Circular microcavities are used to isolate E.coli cells that swim along the cavity wall, resulting in self-sustained oscillations. Upon connecting these cavities by microchannels the bacterial motions can be coupled, yielding nonlinear dynamic synchronization patterns with phase slips. We demonstrate that the coordinated movement observed in coupled E. coli oscillators follows mathematical rules of synchronization which we use to quantify the coupling strength. These findings advance our understanding of motility in confinement, and lay the foundation for engineering desired dynamics in microbial active matter.</description>

      <title>Isotope effect on the anomalies of water: a corresponding states analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09010v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light and heavy water show similar anomalies in thermodynamic and dynamic properties, with a consistent trend of anomalies occurring at higher temperature in heavy water. Viscosity also increases faster upon cooling in heavy water, causing a giant isotope effect, with a viscosity ratio near 2.4 at 244 K. While a simple temperature shift apparently helps in collapsing experimental data for both isotopes, it lacks a clear justification, changes value with the property considered, and requires additional ad hoc scaling factors. Here we use a corresponding states analysis based on the possible existence of a liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water. This provides a coherent framework which leads to the collapse of thermodynamic data. The ratio between dynamic properties of the isotopes is strongly reduced. In particular, the decoupling between viscosity $\eta$ and self-diffusion $D$, measured as a function of temperature $T$ by the Stokes-Einstein ratio $D\eta/T$, is found to collapse after applying the corresponding states analysis. Our results are consistent with simulations and suggest that the various isotope effects mirror the one on the liquid-liquid transition.</description>

      <title>On the thermodynamics of DNA in the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the direct method of molecular dynamics, the temperature dependence of energy, partition function, entropy and free energy, describing the first-order phase transition, is calculated for the classical Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model of the DNA molecule. It is shown that without taking into account the quantum freezing of the degrees of freedom at low temperatures, the relationship between these quantities is not determined. An estimation was given for the number of bubbles in homogeneous DNA chains: PolyA/PolyT and PolyG/PolyC.</description>

      <title>Non-coherent evolution of closed weakly interacting system leads to equidistribution of probabilities of microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The rates of transitions between states of the system, that characterize the process, are found by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Further, we search for time dependence of mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that under made assumptions it is governed by Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, the non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus we present the possible solution for the famous time-arrow problem.</description>
