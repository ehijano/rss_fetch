      <title>AGNI: A radiative-convective model for lava planet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important that we are able to accurately model the atmospheres of (exo)planets. This is because atmospheres play a central role in setting a planet's thermochemical environment at a given point in time, and also in regulating how it evolves over geological timescales. Additionally, it is primarily by observation of their atmospheres that we are able to characterise exoplanets. There is particular demand for accurate models in the context of so-called lava worlds: planets with molten interiors (or `magma oceans').
  AGNI is a Julia program designed to solve for the temperature and radiation environment within the atmospheres of rocky (exo)planets. It leverages a well established FORTRAN code to calculate radiative fluxes from a given atmospheric temperature structure and composition, which -- alongside representations of convection and other processes -- enables an energy-conserving numerical solution for the atmospheric conditions. In contrast to most other numerical atmosphere models, AGNI uses a Newton-Raphson optimisation method to obtain its solution, which enables improved performance and scalability. Our model was specifically developed for use alongside planetary interior models within a coupled simulation framework. However, it can also be applied to scientific problems standalone when used as an executable program; it reads TOML configuration files and outputs figures and NetCDF datasets. AGNI can also function as a software library; it is used in this sense within the Jupyter notebook tutorials of our GitHub repository (https://nichollsh.github.io/AGNI/dev/)</description>

      <title>Galileo Project Observatory Class System Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific investigation of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is limited by poor data quality and a lack of transparency. Existing data are often fragmented, uncalibrated, and missing critical metadata. To address these limitations, the authors present the Observatory Class Integrated Computing Platform (OCICP), a system designed for the systematic and scientific study of UAPs. OCICP employs multiple sensors to collect and analyze data on aerial phenomena. The OCICP system consists of two subsystems. The first is the Edge Computing Subsystem which is located within the observatory site. This subsystem performs real-time data acquisition, sensor optimization, and data provenance management. The second is the Post-Processing Subsystem which resides outside the observatory. This subsystem supports data analysis workflows, including commissioning, census operations, science operations, and system effectiveness monitoring. This design and implementation paper describes the system lifecycle, associated processes, design, implementation, and preliminary results of OCICP, emphasizing the ability of the system to collect comprehensive, calibrated, and scientifically sound data.</description>

      <title>Applying Vision Transformers on Spectral Analysis of Astronomical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), originally developed for image recognition, to the analysis of astronomical spectral data. By converting traditional one-dimensional spectra into two-dimensional image representations, we enable ViTs to capture both local and global spectral features through spatial self-attention. We fine-tune a ViT pretrained on ImageNet using millions of spectra from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, represented as spectral plots. Our model is evaluated on key tasks including stellar object classification and redshift ($z$) estimation, where it demonstrates strong performance and scalability. We achieve classification accuracy higher than Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, and attain $R^2$ values comparable to AstroCLIP's spectrum encoder, even when generalizing across diverse object types. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pretrained vision models for spectroscopic data analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first application of ViTs to large-scale, which also leverages real spectroscopic data and does not rely on synthetic inputs.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of the Digital Receiver System for the next-generation radio interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and validation of a digital receiver system developed for the next-generation radio interferometer projects. The receiver supports 8 analog inputs with 12-bit, 4GHz sampling and performs real-time signal processing using FPGA-based channelization. Field experiments were conducted to observe the Sun, a satellite beacon, and Cassiopeia A. Interference fringes were analyzed and modeled. Time delay compensation was implemented in two ways: theoretical calculation and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) fitting. Results show sub-nanosecond consistency between the two methods. The field experiments demonstrate the receiver's suitability for future radio telescopes such as the BINGO-ABDUS project.</description>

      <title>RESOLVE: Rare Event Surrogate Likelihood for Gravitational Wave Paleontology Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first detection of gravitational waves, recognized by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, has opened up a new research field: gravitational-wave paleontology. When massive stars evolve into black holes and collide, they create gravitational waves that propagate through space and time. These gravitational-waves, now detectable on Earth, act as fossils tracing the histories of the massive stars that created them. Estimating physics parameters of these massive stars from detected gravitational-waves is a parameter estimation task, with the primary difficulty being the extreme rarity of collisions in simulated binary black holes. This rarity forces researchers to choose between prohibitively expensive simulations or accepting substantial statistical variance. In this work, we present RESOLVE, a rare event surrogate model that leverages polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Bayesian MCMC to emulate this rare formation efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that RESOLVE is the only surrogate model that achieves proper statistical coverage, while effectively learning the underlying distribution of each physics parameter. We construct a likelihood function incorporating both the emulated formation efficiency and LIGO's gravitational wave observations, which we then minimize to produce community-standard credible intervals for each physics parameter. These results enable astronomers to gain deeper insights into how the universe transformed from simple gases into the complex chemical environment that eventually made life possible.</description>

      <title>Sampling Bayesian probabilities given only sampled priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical Bayesian inference on the values of some parameters of interest $q$ from some data $D$ involves running a Markov Chain (MC) to sample from the posterior $p(q,n | D) \propto \mathcal{L}(D | q,n) p(q) p(n),$ where $n$ are some nuisance parameters. In many cases, the nuisance parameters are high-dimensional, and their prior $p(n)$ is itself defined only by a set of samples that have been drawn from some other MC. Two problems arise: first, the MC for the posterior will typically require evaluation of $p(n)$ at arbitrary values of $n,$ \ie\ one needs to provide a density estimator over the full $n$ space from the provided samples. Second, the high dimensionality of $n$ hinders both the density estimation and the efficiency of the MC for the posterior. We describe a solution to this problem: a linear compression of the $n$ space into a much lower-dimensional space $u$ which projects away directions in $n$ space that cannot appreciably alter $\mathcal{L}.$ The algorithm for doing so is a slight modification to principal components analysis, and is less restrictive on $p(n)$ than other proposed solutions to this issue. We demonstrate this ``mode projection'' technique using the analysis of 2-point correlation functions of weak lensing fields and galaxy density in the \textit{Dark Energy Survey}, where $n$ is a binned representation of the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Real-time Light Curve Classification Framework for the Wide Field Survey Telescope Using Modified Semi-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern time-domain astronomy will benefit from the vast data collected by survey telescopes. The 2.5 m Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with its powerful capabilities, is promising to make significant contributions in the era of large sky surveys. To harness the full potential of the enormous amount of unlabeled light curve data that the WFST will collect, we have developed a semisupervised light curve classification framework. This framework showcases several unique features. First, it is optimized for classifying events based on the early phase of the light curve (three days after trigger), which can help identify interesting events early and enable efficient follow-up observations. Second, the semisupervised nature of our framework allows it to leverage valuable information from large volumes of unlabeled data, potentially bridging the gap between simulations and real observations and achieving better generalization in practical scenarios. Compared to the commonly used Recurrent Neural Network models, our framework has shown a 5.59% improvement in accuracy for early classification tasks, as well as improvements in precision and recall in almost all subclasses. Moreover, our approach provides a reconstructed light curve, along with a compact latent representation, offering a different perspective that can be used for further downstream tasks beyond classification. The code and model weights used in this work are maintained and publicly available on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>High-precision light curves of geostationary objects: The PHANTOM ECHOES 2 RPO campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from an extensive optical observation campaign that monitored the Geostationary satellites Intelsat 10-02, Mission Extension Vehicle 2, Thor 5, Thor 6, Thor 7, and Meteosat 11 over a 14 week period that covered the proximity operations and docking of Mission Extension Vehicle 2 with Intelsat 10-02. High-cadence single-color photometric observations are supplemented with targeted multi-color observations, high resolution imaging, and passive radio frequency positioning obtained using complementary facilities.
  The photometric signatures of the six targets are presented in the form of two-dimensional color maps. A selection of interesting features are investigated in further detail, including a rapid glinting behavior in Thor 6; a brightening event from Meteosat 11; using glints to constrain the unresolved positions of Intelsat 10-02 and MEV-2; changes in the photometric signature of Intelsat 10-02 before and after docking; and signatures of attitude changes and maneuvering in the light curves of MEV-2.
  A detailed description of the photometric data reduction pipeline is also presented, with a focus on details that must be considered when aiming for sub-percent photometric precision.</description>

      <title>A general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation code for studying advective, sub-Keplerian accretion flow onto black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation code which is developed to simulate advective accretion flow onto black holes. We are particularly interested in the accretion simulations of sub-Keplerian matter in the close vicinity of black holes. Due to the presence of centrifugal barrier, a nearly free-falling sub-Keplerian accretion flow slows down close to a black hole and can even pass through shocks before accelerating again to the black hole. We design our simulation code using the high resolution shock capturing scheme so that such shock structures can be captured and analyzed for relevance. In this paper, we describe our implementation and validation of the code against a few known analytical and numerical results of sub-Keplerian matter accretion.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Crab Nebula with the Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope stereoscopic system at low altitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) stereoscopic system is composed of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed for optimal performance for gamma-ray astronomy in the multi-TeV energy range. It features a 4-meter-diameter tessellated mirror dish and an innovative SiPM-based camera. Its optical system features a 4-m diameter spherical mirror dish based on the Davies-Cotton design, maintaining a good image quality over a large FoV while minimizing optical aberrations. In 2022, two SST-1M telescopes were installed at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory, Czech Republic, at an altitude of 510 meters above sea level, and have been collecting data for commissioning and astronomical observations since then. We present the first SST-1M observations of the Crab Nebula, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024 in both mono and stereoscopic modes. During this observation period, 46 hours for the SST-1M-1 and 52 hours for the SST-1M-2 were collected for which 33 hours are in stereoscopic mode. We use the Crab Nebula observation to validate the expected performance of the instrument, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations carefully tuned to account for instrumental and atmospheric effects. We determined that the energy threshold at the analysis level for the zenith angles below $30^\circ$ is 1 TeV for mono mode and 1.3 TeV for stereo mode. The energy and angular resolutions are approximately 20\% and $0.18^\circ$ for mono mode and 10\% and $0.10^\circ$ for stereo mode, respectively. We present the off-axis performance of the instrument and a detailed study of systematic uncertainties. The results of a full simulation of the telescope and its camera is compared to the data for the first time, allowing a deep understanding of the SST-1M array performance.</description>

      <title>SPLASH: A Rapid Host-Based Supernova Classifier for Wide-Field Time-Domain Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will detect millions of supernovae (SNe) and generate millions of nightly alerts, far outpacing available spectroscopic resources. Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of $76\%$ and an F1-score of $69\%$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows classification of $\sim 500$ SNe per second, making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.</description>

      <title>Radioastron probing the fine structure of the flaring H2O maser in star-forming region G25.65+1.05</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper describes a Space-VLBI observation of the 22 GHz H2O masers in the massive star-forming region G25.65+1.05, using the 10-m space antenna of Radioastron together with the ground-based VLBA array. Two observing epochs at the pre-flare and post-flare state of the maser source are presented. Leveraging the exceptional angular resolution provided by space-ground baselines along with the broad UV coverage from VLBA baselines, we gained a detailed perspective on the area associated with the maser flare events.</description>

      <title>In-situ control of the resonant frequency of kinetic inductance detectors with multiplexed readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multiplexing factors are a primary advantage of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), but the implementation of high density arrays still presents significant challenges. Deviations between designed and achieved resonant frequencies are common, and differential loading and responsivity variation across an array may lead to dynamic inter-resonator interactions. It is therefore valuable to be able to both set and maintain the resonant frequency of a KID in situ, using the readout system. We show that it is possible to alter the resonant frequency of the devices by multiple linewidths through the application of readout current, and establish a new stable operational bias point at the driven frequency by making use of the hysteretic bistability commonly seen as bifurcation in frequency-domain measurements. We examine this interaction using a readout tone at fixed frequency positioned near or within the unbiased resonant bandwidth. Development of a control methodology based on this principle remains in an early stage, but a foundational step is understanding the interaction of the readout current with the resonator, in particular its influence on the resonant frequency. In this work, we study conventional KIDs with no physical isolation from the substrate, so we posit that the readout current primarily interacts with the resonator via non-thermal mechanisms, resulting in a predominantly reactive response. This behaviour is reproduced by a simple lumped-element circuit model of the resonance and readout system, providing a straightforward framework for analysis and interpretation. This demonstration is an important early step in the development of techniques which seek to dynamically alter the resonant frequencies of conventional KID arrays, and sets the stage for fast active resonant frequency control under operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Six-way Observations from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the angular diameters of six stars using the 6-element observing mode of the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) for the first time since the early 2000s. Four of the diameters ranged from 1.2 mas to 1.9 mas, while the two others were much smaller at approximately 0.5 mas to 0.7 mas, which are the two smallest angular diameters measured to date with the NPOI. There is a larger spread in the measurements than data obtained with 3- or 4- or 5-element modes, which can be attributed in part to the flux imbalance due to the combination of more than 2 siderostats in a single spectrograph, and also to cross talk between multiple baselines related to non-linearities in the fast delay line dither strokes. We plan to address this in the future by using the VISION beam combiner.</description>

      <title>Science Prospects for the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory: SWGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now well established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. HESS, located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited in terms of field of view and energy reach.
  SWGO is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.</description>

      <title>Multiband parameter estimation with phase coherence and extrinsic marginalization: Extracting more information from low-SNR CBC signals in LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel coherent multiband analysis framework for characterizing stellar- and intermediate-mass binary black holes using LISA and next-generation ground-based detectors (ET and CE), leveraging the latest developments in the \texttt{PyCBC} pipeline. Given the population parameters inferred from LVK results and LISA's sensitivity limits at high frequencies, most stellar-mass binary black holes would likely have SNRs below 5 in LISA, but the most state-of-the-art multiband parameter estimation methods, such as those using ET and CE posteriors as priors for LISA, typically struggle to analyze sources with a LISA SNR less than 5. We present a novel coherent multiband parameter estimation method that directly calculates a joint likelihood, which is highly efficient; this efficiency is enabled by multiband marginalization of the extrinsic parameter space, implemented using importance sampling, which can work robustly even when the LISA SNR is as low as 3. Having an SNR of $\sim 3$ allows LISA to contribute nearly double the number of multiband sources. Even if LISA only observes for one year, most of the multiband detector-frame chirp mass's 90\% credible interval (less than $10^{-4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$) is still better than that of the most accurately measured events for ET+2CE network in 7.5 years of observation, by at least one order of magnitude. For the first time, we show efficient multiband Bayesian parameter estimation results on the population scale, which paves the way for large-scale astrophysical tests using multibanding.</description>

Abstract: The large number of strong lenses discoverable in future astronomical surveys will likely enhance the value of strong gravitational lensing as a cosmic probe of dark energy and dark matter. However, leveraging the increased statistical power of such large samples will require further development of automated lens modeling techniques. We show that deep learning and simulation-based inference (SBI) methods produce informative and reliable estimates of parameter posteriors for strong lensing systems in ground-based surveys. We present the examination and comparison of two approaches to lens parameter estimation for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses -- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We perform inference on 1-, 5-, and 12-parameter lens models for ground-based imaging data that mimics the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that NPE outperforms BNNs, producing posterior distributions that are more accurate, precise, and well-calibrated for most parameters. For the 12-parameter NPE model, the calibration is consistently within $&lt;$10\% of optimal calibration for all parameters, while the BNN is rarely within 20\% of optimal calibration for any of the parameters. Similarly, residuals for most of the parameters are smaller (by up to an order of magnitude) with the NPE model than the BNN model. This work takes important steps in the systematic comparison of methods for different levels of model complexity.</description>

      <title>Electric field reconstruction with three polarizations for the radio detection of ultra-high energy particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the electric field produced by Extensive Air Showers from the signals recorded by the antennas is essential for the radio detection technique, as the key parameters needed to retrieve information about the primary particle that generated the shower are the amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at each measurement position. Conventional electric field reconstruction methods primarily focus on antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical $\chi^2$ minimization method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves a standard deviation better than 4\% in determining the peak envelope amplitude of the electric field and better than 6\% in the estimation of the energy fluence, with an antenna response dependent bias. Additionally, we have studied the dependence of the method with arrival direction showing that it has a good performance in almost all of them. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method improves our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Bayesian Sampling for Massive Black Hole Binaries with Prior Constraints from Conditional Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) model is employed for parameter inference on gravitational waves (GW) signals of massive black hole binaries, considering joint observations with a network of three space-based GW detectors. Our experiments show that the trained CVAE model can estimate the posterior distribution of source parameters in approximately one second, while the standard Bayesian sampling method, utilizing parallel computation across 16 CPU cores, takes an average of 20 hours for a GW signal instance. However, the sampling distributions from CVAE exhibit lighter tails, appearing broader when compared to the standard Bayesian sampling results. By using CVAE results to constrain the prior range for Bayesian sampling, the sampling time is reduced by a factor of $\sim$6 while maintaining the similar precision of the Bayesian results.</description>

      <title>The anti-glitching gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1522-5735</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. A small number of pulsar glitches have been identified as anti-glitches or spin-down glitches, where the overall contribution to the pulsar's rotation frequency is negative. A notable example of a spin-down glitch was observed in PSR 1522-5735, a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar discovered by blind searches in the 3-year data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Aims. This work aims to search for PSR 1522-5735's glitches using Fermi-LAT data from over 15 years of observations. Methods. The weighted H-test statistic was applied to identify glitches and evaluate the related changes in pulsar's spin parameters. The timing solution based on these results was further refined by maximization of the unbinned likelihood. The Bayesian information criterion was used to set an appropriate number of parameters in the timing solution to avoid overfitting. Results. The analysis revealed eight glitch events: regular spin-up glitch, spin-up glitch over-recovered to a spin-down and six anti-glitches. These events were radiatively quiet, exhibiting no significant variations in the shape of the pulse profile or energy flux. Conclusions. The results may suggest that an internal mechanism is responsible for spin-down glitch phenomena.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>

Abstract: Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]&gt;~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.</description>
