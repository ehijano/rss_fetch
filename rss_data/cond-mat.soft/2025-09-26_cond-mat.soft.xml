      <title>Fundamental Scaling Constraints for Equilibrium Molecular Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular computing promises massive parallelization to explore solution spaces, but so far practical implementations remain limited due to off-target binding and exponential proliferation of competing structures. Here, we investigate the theoretical limits of equilibrium self-assembly systems for solving computing problems, focusing on the directed Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP) as a benchmark for NP-complete problems. The HPP is encoded via particles with directional lock-key patches, where self-assembled chains form candidate solution paths. We determine constraints on the required energy gap between on-target and off-target binding for the HPP to be encoded and solved. We simultaneously examine whether components with the required energy gap can be designed. Combining these results yields a phase diagram identifying regions where HPP instances are both encodable and solvable. These results establish fundamental upper bounds on equilibrium molecular computation and highlight the necessity of non-equilibrium approaches for scalable molecular computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Function with Thermal Fluctuations in Mechanical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic networks can be tuned to exhibit complex mechanical responses and have been extensively used to study protein allosteric functionality, where a localized strain regulates the conformation at a distant site. We show that cooperative binding, where two sites each enhance the other's ability to function, can be trained via a symmetric application of the training previously employed for creating network allostery. We identify a crossover temperature above which cooperative functionality breaks down due to thermal fluctuations. We develop a modified training protocol to increase this crossover temperature, enabling function to remain robust at biologically relevant temperatures.</description>

      <title>Particle-scale studies elucidating visco-collisional rheology in granular-fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the particle-scale dynamics that give rise to bulk flow behaviours of highly concentrated particle-fluid mixtures using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We utilize boundary conditions of a stress-controlled shear cell and vary material properties and applied stresses systematically. We find the bulk rheology transitions smoothly among what might be called viscous, collisional, and visco-collisional behaviours based on average shear rate dependence as well as dominance of local interaction. Using specific measures of particle-scale dynamics, we find that the transitions in system rheologies coincide with statistically significant changes in the ``fabric'' (i.e., strong force network and coordination numbers), the ``granular temperature'' (i.e., fluctuation energy) and relative importance of fluid and interparticle contacts. Armed with these measures and previous theoretical work, we provide a foundation for understanding the particle-scale physics that gives rise to meso-scale rheologies and transitions from one to the next. We determine physics-based formulations to better represent dynamic behaviors for a wide range of material properties and loading conditions. Our study broadens the applicability of rheological models to natural and engineered systems by providing a foundation for a more general constitutive model.</description>

      <title>Topological Catenation-induced Pore Size in 2D Olympic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assemblies of ring DNA and proteins, such as kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the chainmail-like network of the HK97 bacteriophage capsid, form "Olympic" topologies that govern the dynamics of gene-regulatory proteins, cellular metabolites, and viral genomes. Yet the pore sizes that control transport and diffusion in these topologically linked networks remain poorly quantified. Here, using coarse-grained simulations of idealized square (SQR) and hexagonal (HEX) lattice catenated two-dimensional Olympic networks, we measure pore size as the radius of the largest rigid tracer that can pass through an aperture and delineate how backbone bending stiffness and topological tension regulate this structure. We identify two competing regulators: (i) ring entropic elasticity, which enlarges pores at low stiffness, and (ii) ring rotation angle, which reduces pore size at high stiffness. Their competition yields bimodal pore size distributions over a defined parameter range. Network geometry further modulates spatial correlations in pore size and the pore size autocorrelation time, predicting distinct propagation of perturbations in isostatic (SQR) versus hypostatic (HEX) architectures. These results provide testable predictions for enzyme diffusion kinetics and cargo release in natural or synthetic catenane DNA networks and mechanically interlocked capsid proteins, and offer a theoretical framework for interpreting FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) and SMT (single-molecule tracking) measurements in topologically catenated biopolymer networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Heterogeneity and Facilitation in Sheared Granular Materials: Insights from 3D Triaxial Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain localization in granular materials arises from complex microscale dynamics, including intermittent particle rearrangements and spatiotemporally correlated deformation. While dynamic heterogeneity (DH) and dynamic facilitation (DF) have been widely studied in two-dimensional amorphous materials, their prevalence in three-dimensional (3D) granular systems remains unclear. Here, we performed a 3D triaxial compression test with in-situ X-ray computed tomography to track particle-scale kinematics across small and large strain increments. We analyzed deviatoric strain, volumetric strain, and non-affine motion fields, computed four-point spatial dynamic correlation functions to probe DH, quantified DF through a facilitation ratio, and assessed temporal persistence of local dynamics using four-point temporal dynamic correlations. Across large strain increments, DH and DF emerge strongly in the transition regime between the initially elastic response and the critical state regime, but weaken or become statistically insignificant within the shear band at the critical state, indicating a qualitative change in microscale dynamics upon localization. In contrast, under small increments, both measures are suppressed across all regimes. These results demonstrate that correlated dynamics depend strongly on both strain increment and deformation regime. This work provides the first comprehensive investigation of DH and DF in 3D granular materials and highlights their strain-increment and regime-dependent behaviors, establishing a connection to glassy dynamics in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistical mechanical gauge invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address gauge invariance in the statistical mechanics of quantum many-body systems. The gauge transformation acts on the position and momentum degrees of freedom and it is represented by a quantum shifting superoperator that maps quantum observables onto each other. The shifting superoperator is anti-self-adjoint and it has noncommutative Lie algebra structure. These properties induce exact equilibrium sum rules that connect locally-resolved force and hyperforce densities for any given observable. We demonstrate the integration of the framework within quantum hyperdensity functional theory and show that it generalizes naturally to nonequilibrium.</description>

      <title>The influence of boundary conditions and interfacial slip on the time taken to achieve a nonequilibrium steady-state for highly confined flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the equilibration time to attain steady-state for a system of liquid molecules under boundary-driven planar Couette flow via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. In particular, we examine the equilibration time for the two common types of boundary driven flow: one in which both walls slide with equal and opposite velocity, and the other in which one wall is fixed and the other moves with twice the velocity. Both flows give identical steady-state strain rates, and hence flow properties, but the transient behaviour is completely different. We find that in the case of no-slip boundary conditions, the equilibration times for the counter-sliding walls flow are exactly 4 times faster than those of the single sliding wall system, and this is independent of the atomistic nature of the fluid, i.e., it is an entirely hydrodynamic feature. We also find that systems that exhibit slip have longer equilibration times in general and the ratio of equilibration times for the two types of boundary-driven flow is even more pronounced. We analyse the problem by decomposing a generic planar Couette flow into a linear sum of purely symmetric and antisymmetric flows. We find that the no-slip equilibration time is dominated by the slowest decaying eigenvalue of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equation. In the case of slip, the longest relaxation time is now dominated by the transient slip velocity response, which is longer than the no-slip response time. In the case of a high-slip system of water confined to graphene channels, the enhancement is over two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Computing finite--temperature elastic constants with noise cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic constants are central material properties, frequently reported in experimental and theoretical studies. While their computation is straightforward in the absence of thermal fluctuations, finite--temperature methods often suffer from poor signal--to--noise ratios or the presence of strong anharmonic effects. Here, we show how to compute elastic constants in thermal ordered and disordered systems by generalizing a noise--cancellation method originally developed for piezoelectric coupling coefficients. A slight strain is applied to an equilibrated solid. Simulations of both the strained and unstrained (or oppositely strained) reference systems are performed using identical thermostatting schemes. As demonstrated theoretically and with generic one--dimensional models, this allows stress differences to be evaluated and elastic constants to be determined with much reduced thermal noise. We then apply this approach across a diverse set of systems, spanning crystalline argon, ordered silicon as well as amorphous silicon, poly(methyl methacrylate), and cellulose derivatives.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics and long-time tails explain shear-induced diffusion of soft athermal particles near jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study shear-induced diffusion of soft athermal particles in two dimensions. The Green-Kubo (GK) formula is applicable to the shear-induced diffusion coefficient, where both mean squared transverse velocity and relaxation time included in the GK formula are well described by critical scaling near jamming. We show that the auto-correlation function of transverse velocities is stretched exponential if the system is below jamming or shear rate is large enough. However, if the system is above jamming and the shear rate is sufficiently small, the auto-correlation function exhibits a long-time tail such that time integral in the GK formula diverges in two dimensions. We propose an empirical scaling relation for the critical exponents and show that the long-time tail is consistent with the divergence of the shear-induced diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Role of Translational Noise in Motility-Induced Phase Separation of Hard Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles, like motile cells and artificial colloids, can spontaneously form macroscopic clusters. This phenomenon is called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and occurs even without attractive forces, provided that the self-propulsion direction fluctuates slowly. In addition to rotational noise, these particles may experience translational noise, not coupled to rotational noise, due to environmental fluctuations. We study the role of translational noise in the clustering of active Brownian hard disks. To tease apart the contribution of translational noise, we model excluded-volume interactions through a Monte-Carlo-like overlap rejection approach. We find that increasing translational diffusivity has a non-monotonic effect on clustering. At low values, it makes clusters more compact and rounded (less filamentous), eventually promoting genuine MIPS. For sufficiently higher translational diffusivity, clusters evaporate. We develop a theory for the cluster mass distribution, and employ a hydrodynamic approach with parameters taken from the simulation, that explains the clustering phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Random close packing fraction of bidisperse discs: Theoretical derivation and exact bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic shrinkage and finite strains in confined frictional contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental investigation of the interplay between friction, contact geometry and finite strains for smooth frictional contacts between rigid spherical glass probes and flat silicone substrates. Using both bulk and layered substrates under various loading conditions (normal force, radius of the probe), we show that shear-induced anisotropic shrinkage of the adhesive contact area under steady-state sliding is an effect of finite-elasticity conditions and is drastically affected by the level of geometric confinement. The resulting non-linear coupling between the normal and lateral directions is also investigated by measuring the changes in the indentation depth (conv. normal load) during the stiction of the adhesive contacts under imposed normal load (conv. indentation depth) conditions, with strong effects of contact confinement. From a comparison with adhesiveless linear contact mechanics calculations, we show that the experimental observations can only be accounted for by the occurrence of finite strains/displacements conditions. Accordingly, measurements of the in-plane surface displacements at the surface of the rubber substrates confirm that strain levels well in the neo-Hookean range are experienced during steady-state frictional sliding.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for Active Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>
