      <title>Relative arbitrage problem under eigenvalue lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of the relative arbitrage problem from stochastic portfolio theory that asks for a time horizon beyond which arbitrage relative to the market exists in all ``sufficiently volatile'' markets. In our formulation, ``sufficiently volatile'' is interpreted as a lower bound on an ordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariation matrix, a quantity that has been studied extensively in the empirical finance literature. Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.</description>

      <title>Near-Maturity Asymptotics of Critical Prices of American Put Options under Exponential L\'{e}vy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the near-maturity ($t\rightarrow T^{-}$) convergence rate of the optimal early-exercise price $b(t)$ of an American put under an exponential L\'{e}vy model with a {\it nonzero} Brownian component. Two important settings, not previous covered in the literature, are considered. In the case that the optimal exercise price converges to the strike price ($b(T^{-})=K$), we contemplate models with negative jumps of unbounded variation (i.e., processes that exhibit high activity of negative jumps or sudden falls in asset prices). In the second case, when the optimal exercise price tend to a value lower than $K$, we consider infinite activity jumps (though still of bounded variations), extending existing results for models with finite jump activity (finitely many jumps in any finite interval). In both cases, we show that $b(T^{-})-b(t)$ is of order $\sqrt{T-t}$ with explicit constants proportionality. Furthermore, we also derive the second-order near-maturity expansion of the American put price around the critical price along a certain parabolic branch.</description>

      <title>A measure-valued HJB perspective on Bayesian optimal adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian adaptive optimal stochastic control problem where a hidden static signal has a non-separable influence on the drift of a noisy observation. Being allowed to control the specific form of this dependence, we aim at optimising a cost functional depending on the posterior distribution of the hidden signal. Our setup is in sharp contrast to existing work: we include costs that depend on the full posterior distribution in a form that admits a large class of non-linear relationships. Expressing the dynamics of this posterior distribution in the observation filtration, we embed our problem into a genuinely infinite-dimensional stochastic control problem using measure-valued martingales. We address this problem by use of viscosity theory and approximation arguments. Specifically, we show equivalence to a corresponding weak formulation, characterise the optimal value of the problem in terms of the unique continuous viscosity solution of an associated HJB equation, and construct a piecewise constant and arbitrarily-close-to-optimal control to our main problem of study. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also provide a novel stability result for a class of measure-valued SDEs which we believe is of independent interest.</description>
