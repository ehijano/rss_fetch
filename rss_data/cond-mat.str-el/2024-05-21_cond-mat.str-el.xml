      <title>The Influence of Extended Interactions on Spin Dynamics in One-dimensional Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials provide a unique platform for understanding the importance and influence of extended interactions on the physics of strongly correlated systems due to their relative structural simplicity and the existence of powerful theoretical tools well-adapted to one spatial dimension. Recently, this was highlighted by anomalous observations in the single-particle spectral function $A(q,\omega)$ of 1D cuprate chain compounds, measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which were explained by the presence of a long-range attractive interaction. Such an extended interaction should leave its fingerprints on other observables, notably the dynamical spin structure factor $S(q,\omega)$, measured by neutron scattering or resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Starting from a simple Hubbard Hamiltonian in 1D and using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) methods, we show that the presence of long-range attractive coupling, directly through an instantaneous Coulomb interaction $V$ or retarded electron-phonon ({\it el-ph}) coupling, can introduce significant spectral weight redistribution in $S(q,\omega)$ across a wide range of doping. This underscores the significant impact that extended interactions can have on dynamical correlations among particles, and the importance of properly incorporating this influence in modeling. Our results demonstrate that $S(q,\omega)$ can provide a sensitive experimental constraint, which complements ARPES measurements, in identifying key interactions in 1D cuprates, beyond the standard Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Attractive Interaction in Spin Spectra of 1D Cuprate Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the minimal model for cuprates is crucial for explaining the high-$T_c$ pairing mechanism. Recent photoemission experiments have suggested a significant near-neighbor attractive interaction $V$ in cuprate chains, favoring pairing instability. To determine its strength, we systematically investigate the dynamical spin structure factors $S(q,\omega)$ using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Our analysis quantitatively reveals a notable softening in the two-spinon continuum, particularly evident in the intense spectrum at large momentum. This softening is primarily driven by the renormalization of the superexchange interaction, as determined by a comparison with the slave-boson theory. We also demonstrate the feasibility of detecting this spectral shift in thin-film samples using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Therefore, this provides a distinctive fingerprint for the attractive interaction, motivating future experiments to unveil essential ingredients in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Determination of the N\'eel vector in rutile altermagnets through x-ray magnetic circular dichroism: the case of MnF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the $L_{2,3}$ edge of Mn in altermagnetic MnF$_2$ using a combination of density functional + exact diagonlization of an atomic model. We explore how the dichroic spectra vary with the light propagation vector and the N\'eel vector. We show how XMCD in rutile structures can be employed to determine the orientation of the N\'eel vector. An exact relationship between the XMCD spectra for different orientation of the N\'eel vector valid in the absence on the valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipole interaction is derived and its approximate validity demonstrated by numerical calculation for the full Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Spin Coulomb Drag Effect and Its Impact on Spin Transport in the Three-Dimensional Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems. This effect leads to the emergence of a spin mass and the finite lifetime of spin currents, posing challenges for the accurate description of spin dynamics. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we investigate the spin-resolved exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the three-dimensional uniform electron gas. Our analysis reveals a distinct nature in the spin response, characterized by a $1/q^2$ divergence in the spin XC kernel at finite frequencies. This so-called ultranonlocal behavior, stemming from the spin Coulomb drag effect, is absent in the charge channel. By extracting precise values for the spin mass enhancement factor, we observe a trend of increasing enhancement with decreasing electron density. Furthermore, we find compelling evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures, characterized by vanishing inverse relaxation times. These findings deepen our understanding of the intricate relation between the Coulomb interaction and the spin transport, providing valuable insights for the development of accurate density functional approximations and the advancement of spintronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced nearly perfect rectangular lattice and superconductivity in an organic molecular crystal (DMET-TTF)$_2$AuBr$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External pressure and associated changes in lattice structures are key to realizing exotic quantum phases such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. While applying external pressure is a standard method to induce novel lattice structures, its impact on organic molecular crystals has been less explored. Here we report a unique structural phase transition in (DMET-TTF)$_2$AuBr$_2$ under pressure. By combining advanced high-pressure techniques and $ab$ $initio$ calculations, we elucidate that (DMET-TTF)$_2$AuBr$_2$ undergoes a transition from a quasi-one-dimensional lattice to a nearly perfect rectangular lattice at 0.9 GPa. This transition leads to the realization of an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator with $T_{\rm N}=66$ K, the highest $T_{\rm N}$ in low-dimensional molecular crystal solids to date. Upon increasing the pressure, the antiferromagnetic ordering is suppressed, and a superconducting phase with $T_{\rm c}=4.8$ K emerges around 6 GPa. Our study reveals the significant impact of external pressure on lattice structures of organic molecular crystals and highlights the intricate relationship between geometrical frustration and superconductivity. Our findings also pave the way for realizing functional organic molecular crystals through changes in lattice structures by pressure.</description>

      <title>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is extremely sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 300 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ is inversely proportional to the cLC order parameter $\eta$. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are extremely sensitive to the dilute impurities.</description>

      <title>YASTN: Yet another symmetric tensor networks; A Python library for abelian symmetric tensor network calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source tensor network Python library for quantum many-body simulations. At its core is an abelian-symmetric tensor, implemented as a sparse block structure managed by logical layer on top of dense multi-dimensional array backend. This serves as the basis for higher-level tensor networks algorithms, operating on matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, implemented here. Using appropriate backend, such as PyTorch, gives direct access to automatic differentiation (AD) for cost-function gradient calculations and execution on GPUs or other supported accelerators. We show the library performance in simulations with infinite projected entangled-pair states, such as finding the ground states with AD, or simulating thermal states of the Hubbard model via imaginary time evolution. We quantify sources of performance gains in those challenging examples allowed by utilizing symmetries.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry and Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) index theorem corresponding to the chiral symmetry of a continuum formulation of staggered fermions called K\"ahler-Dirac fermions, which have been recently investigated as an ingredient in lattice constructions of chiral gauge theories. We point out that there are two notions of chiral symmetry for K\"ahler-Dirac fermions, both having a mixed perturbative anomaly with gravity leading to index theorems on closed manifolds. By formulating these theories on a manifold with boundary, we find the APS index theorems corresponding to each of these symmetries, necessary for a complete picture of anomaly inflow, using a recently discovered physics-motivated proof. We comment on a fundamental difference between the nature of these two symmetries by showing that a sensible local, symmetric boundary condition only exists for one of the two symmetries. This sheds light on how these symmetries behave under lattice discretization, and in particular on their use for recent symmetric-mass generation proposals.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic landscape in kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and competition with family of Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (Ln: Tb-Lu) shurikagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, the smallest rare-earth containing member of the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ family. We previously reported on the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ (Ln: La-Gd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{2+}$, Yb$^{2+}$) kagome metals. This structure type represents a magnetically diverse and exfoliable family of kagome metals. Detailed characterization of the magnetic and electronic transport properties of TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ reveals a highly complex landscape of magnetic phases arising from an antiferromagnetic ground state. A series of metamagnetic transitions creates at least 5 unique phase pockets, including a 1/3 and 2/3 magnetization plateau. Further, the system exhibits an intimate connection between the magnetism and magnetotransport, exhibiting sharp switching from positive (+40%) to negative magnetoresistance (-50%) near a metamagnetic transition. Unlike the Lu-Gd analogs, TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ cannot be synthesized by the methodology presented previously due to phase competition with another, unreported class of materials, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (x$\sim$1.7-1.2) (Ln: Tb--Lu) shurikagome metals. Like the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ kagome metals, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family exhibits quasi-2D networks of titanium and chains of rare-earth. We present the structures and some select basic properties of the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family alongside the newly discovered TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. A discussion regarding the phase competition between the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ families helps frame the difficulty in synthesizing LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ compounds with small \textit{Ln} species and provides a strategy to circumvent formation of Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$.</description>

      <title>Generic Approach to Intrinsic Magnetic Second-order Topological Insulators via Inverted $p-d$ Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of intrinsically magnetic and topologically nontrivial two-dimensional materials holds tantalizing prospects for the exotic quantum anomalous Hall insulators and magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs). Compared with the well-studied nonmagnetic counterparts, the pursuit of intrinsic magnetic SOTIs remains limited. In this work, we address this gap by focusing on $p-d$ orbitals inversion, a fundamental but often overlooked phenomena in the construction of topological materials. We begin by developing a theoretical framework to elucidate $p-d$ orbitals inversion through a combined density-functional theory calculation and Wannier downfolding. Subsequently we showcase the generality of this concept in realizing ferromagnetism SOTIs by identifying two real materials with distinct lattices: 1$T$-VS$_2$ in a hexagonal lattice, and CrAs monolayer in a square lattice. We further compare it with other mechanisms requiring spin-orbit coupling and explore the similarities to topological Kondo insulators. Our findings establish a generic pathway towards intrinsic magnetic SOTIs.</description>

      <title>Structural properties, dielectric relaxation and impedance spectroscopy of NASICON type Na$_{3+x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Pr$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric and impedance spectroscopic investigation of Pr-doped NASICON type Na$_{3+x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Pr$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.05--0.2) samples as a function of temperature and frequency. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray diffraction patterns confirms the monoclinic phase having C2/c space groups for all the samples. The scanning electron microscopy shows the granular-like structure and energy dispersive x-ray analysis confirms the desired compositions. The temperature (90--400~K) and frequency (20 Hz-2 MHz) dependence of electric permittivity are explained using Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization and space charge polarization mechanisms. The dielectric relaxation shows nearly equal activation energy for all the samples with a non-Debye type of relaxation in the measured temperature range. The complex impedance analysis shows the presence of broad grain and grain boundary relaxation peaks. The stretched exponent analysis of electric modulus using the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) function further confirms the non-Debye type of relaxation. Moreover, scaling analysis of the electric modulus shows a similar type of relaxation for all the samples. The {\it a.c.} conductivity data are fitted using modified power law, where the temperature dependence of exponent ($s$) confirms the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) type conduction for all the samples. Our results indicate that the Pr doped NASICON samples are potential candidates for charge storage devices due to their large electric permittivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of electronic correlations and quantum delocalization onto the static structure factor and static density response function of the strongly coupled electron liquid. In contrast to a classical system, the density response of the electron liquid vanishes on small length scales due to quantum delocalization effects, which we rigorously quantify in terms of imaginary-time correlation functions and dynamic Matsubara response functions. This allows us to analyze the interplay of structural order and dynamic quantum effects as it manifests in the dynamic Matsubara local field correction. Finally, we identify an effective electronic attraction in the spin-offdiagonal static density response when the wavelength of the perturbation is commensurate with the average interparticle distance.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium carrier and phonon dynamics in the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast carrier and phonon dynamics in the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ using time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Our results reveal that the electron-phonon thermalization process with a subpicosecond timescale is prolonged by the hot-phonon bottleneck effect. We identify the subsequent relaxation processes associated with two non-radiative recombination mechanisms, i.e., phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination and defect-related Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Temperature-dependent measurements indicate that all three relaxation components show large variation around 175 and 78 K, which is related to the initiation of spin fluctuation and ferrimagnetic order in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. In addition, two pronounced coherent optical phonons are observed, in which the phonon with a frequency of 3.7 THz is attributed to the $A_{1g}$ mode of Te precipitates. Applying the strain pulse propagation model to the coherent acoustic phonons yields a penetration depth of 506 nm and a sound speed of 2.42 km/s in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. Our results develop understanding of the nonequilibrium properties of the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and also shed light on its potential applications in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>

Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic spin-wave theory tailored to describe quantum trajectories in continuously monitored long-range interacting spin systems. Our method, based on the bosonization of spin-wave excitations on top of a strong collective polarization, enables the efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins, offering insights into nonlinear features of the dynamics such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring an entanglement phase transition in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions and dwelling on how our method mitigates the experimental challenges of post-selection in detecting monitored quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Topological phase diagrams of in-plane field polarized Kitaev magnets</title>

Abstract: While the existence of a magnetic field induced quantum spin liquid in Kitaev magnets remains under debate, its topological properties often extend to proximal phases where they can lead to unusual behaviors of both fundamental and applied interests. Subjecting a generic nearest neighbor spin model of Kitaev magnets to a sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic field, we study the resulting polarized phase and the associated magnon excitations. In contrast to the case of an out-of-plane magnetic field where the magnon band topology is enforced by symmetry, we find that it is possible for topologically trivial and nontrivial parameter regimes to coexist under in-plane magnetic fields. We map out the topological phase diagrams of the magnon bands, revealing a rich pattern of variation of the Chern number over the parameter space and the field angle. We further compute the magnon thermal Hall conductivity as a weighted summation of Berry curvatures, and discuss experimental implications of our results to planar thermal Hall effects in Kitaev magnets.</description>

      <title>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful tool for probing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of materials. Historically, $\textit{in situ}$ magnetic fields have been carefully avoided as they are detrimental to the control of photoelectron trajectory during the photoelectron detection process. However, magnetic field is an important experimental knob for both probing and tuning symmetry-breaking phases and electronic topology in quantum materials. In this paper, we introduce an easily implementable method for realizing an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field at the sample position in an ARPES experiment and analyze magnetic field induced artifacts in ARPES data. Specifically, we identified and quantified three distinct extrinsic effects of a magnetic field: Fermi surface rotation, momentum shrinking, and momentum broadening. We examined these effects in three prototypical quantum materials, i.e., a topological insulator (Bi$_2$Se$_3$), an iron-based superconductor (LiFeAs), and a cuprate superconductor (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$), and demonstrate the feasibility of ARPES measurements in the presence of a controllable magnetic field. Our studies lay the foundation for the future development of the technique and interpretation of ARPES measurements of field-tunable quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

Abstract: We present several approximate calculations of the specific heat capacity of the model for Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ proposed by Balz et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 174414 (2017)], using methods including exact diagonalization, Thermal Pure Quantum States, and high-temperature expansions. In none of these cases are we able to reproduce the magnitude of the zero-field specific heat capacity shown in the intermediate-temperature $({\sim}\,5-15\,\rm{K})$ experimental data. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy, and what it might tell us about the magnetic Hamiltonian for Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Square-Lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ Model for Electron-Doped Cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models, we investigate the role of inter-site interactions $V$ by studying the $t$-$J$-$V$ model on square lattices. Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify the ground-state phase diagram across varying inter-site interactions $V$ and doping concentration $\delta$. We find that the phase diagram with finite inter-site interactions $2\lesssim V/J\lesssim3$ offers a more accurate description of electron-doped cuprates than the conventional Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models. Moreover, we reveal the role of inter-site interactions $V$ at varying doping levels: at light doping, inter-site interactions favor N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic order, and suppress both superconductivity and charge density wave; around optimal doping, these interactions support a pseudogap-like phase while suppressing superconductivity, and we further perform the slave boson mean-field analysis to understand the numerical results microscopically; at higher doping, the effects of inter-site interactions become insignificant, with our numerical predictions suggesting the emergence of incommensurate spin density wave phase. Our specific focus around optimal doping with various inter-site interactions identifies successive phases including phase separation, uniform $d$-wave SC and a pseudogap-like phase, and reveals a relative insensitivity of charge density wave to superconductivity. Our study suggests the $t$-$J$-$V$ model as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Exact staggered dimer ground state and its stability in a two-dimensional magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding an exact solution for a realistic interacting quantum many-body problem is often challenging. There are only a few problems where an exact solution can be found, usually in a narrow parameter space. Here, we propose a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy and bond depletion for the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions but not for the next-nearest-neighbor interactions. This model has an \emph{exact} and \emph{unique} dimer ground state at $J_2/J_1=1/2$; a dimer state is a product state of spin-singlets on dimers (here, staggered nearest-neighbor bonds). We examine this model by employing the bond-operator mean-field theory and exact diagonalization. These analytical and numerical methods precisely affirm the correctness of the dimer ground state at the exact point ($J_2/J_1=1/2$). As one moves away from the exact point, the dimer order melts and vanishes when the spin gap becomes zero. The mean-field theory with harmonic approximation indicates that the dimer order persists for $-0.35\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim 1.35$. However, in non-harmonic approximation, the upper critical point lowers by $0.28$ to $1.07$, but the lower critical point remains intact. The exact diagonalization results suggest that the latter approximation fares better. The model reveals N\'eel order below the lower critical point and stripe magnetic order above the upper critical point. It has a topologically equivalent model on a honeycomb lattice where the nearest-neighbor interactions are still spatial anisotropic, but the bond depletion shifts into the isotropic next-neighbor interactions. Moreover, these models can also be generalized in the three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries and LSM-type constraints on a tensor product Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the exact non-invertible Kramers-Wannier symmetry of 1+1d lattice models on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits. This symmetry is associated with a topological defect and a conserved operator, and the latter can be presented as a matrix product operator. Importantly, unlike its continuum counterpart, the symmetry algebra involves lattice translations. Consequently, it is not described by a fusion category. In the presence of this defect, the symmetry algebra involving parity/time-reversal is realized projectively, which is reminiscent of an anomaly. Different Hamiltonians with the same lattice non-invertible symmetry can flow in their continuum limits to infinitely many different fusion categories (with different Frobenius-Schur indicators), including, as a special case, the Ising CFT. The non-invertible symmetry leads to a constraint similar to that of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis, implying that the system cannot have a unique gapped ground state. It is either in a gapless phase or in a gapped phase with three (or a multiple of three) ground states, associated with the spontaneous breaking of the lattice non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose extremal black holes (BH) as critical points of a new class of gravitational collapses. The conjecture is made by observing the Continuous Self Similarity (CSS) and Discrete Self Similarity (DSS) behaviours of perturbations of an extremal black hole spacetime and compare them to similar properties of Choptuik-type critical solutions. By performing analytical perturbation studies on extremal black holes, we explicitly show that the DSS solution found here can be interpreted as renormalization group (RG) limit cycles, and the transition between CSS and DSS regimes occurs as the stable and unstable fixed points collide and move to the complex plane. We argue that the DSS solutions found in spherically symmetric gravitational collapses can be similarly interpreted. We identify various phenomena in non-gravitational systems with RG limit cycles, including DSS correlation function, DSS scaling laws in correlation length and order parameters, which are observed in gravitational critical collapses. We also discuss a version of gravitational Efimov effect.</description>

Abstract: The Witten effect predicts that a magnetic monopole acquires a fractional electric charge inside topological insulators.
  In this work, we give a microscopic description of this phenomenon, as well as an analogous two-dimensional system with a vortex. We solve the Dirac equation of electron field both analytically in continuum and numerically on a lattice, by adding the Wilson term and smearing the gauge field within a finite range to regularize the short-distance behavior of the system. Our results reveal that the Wilson term induces a strong positive mass shift, creating a domain-wall around the monopole/vortex. This small, yet finite-sized domain-wall localizes the chiral zero modes and ensures their stability through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, whose cobordism invariance is crucial in explaining why the electric charge is fractional.</description>

Abstract: Topological subsystem codes in three spatial dimensions allow for quantum error correction with no time overhead, even in the presence of measurement noise. The physical origins of this single-shot property remain elusive, in part due to the scarcity of known models. To address this challenge, we provide a systematic construction of a class of topological subsystem codes in three dimensions built from abelian quantum double models in one fewer dimension. Our construction not only generalizes the recently introduced subsystem toric code [Kubica and Vasmer, Nat. Commun. 13, 6272 (2022)] but also provides a new perspective on several aspects of the original model, including the origin of the Gauss law for gauge flux, and boundary conditions for the code family. We then numerically study the performance of the first few codes in this class against phenomenological noise to verify their single-shot property. Lastly, we discuss Hamiltonians naturally associated with these codes, and argue that they may be gapless.</description>

Abstract: The time evolution of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications for near-term quantum computers. However, the utility of current quantum devices is strongly hampered by the proliferation of hardware errors. The minimization of the circuit depth for a given quantum algorithm is therefore highly desirable, since shallow circuits generally are less vulnerable to decoherence. Recently, it was shown that variational circuits are a promising approach to outperform current state-of-the-art methods such as Trotter decomposition, although the optimal choice of parameters is a computationally demanding task. In this work, we demonstrate a simplification of the variational optimization of circuits implementing the time evolution operator of local Hamiltonians by directly encoding constraints of the physical system under consideration. We study the expressibility of such constrained variational circuits for different models and constraints. Our results show that the encoding of constraints allows a reduction of optimization cost by more than one order of magnitude and scalability to arbitrary large system sizes, without loosing accuracy in most systems. Furthermore, we discuss the exceptions in locally-constrained systems and provide an explanation by means of an restricted lightcone width after incorporating the constraints into the circuits.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Mott's formula for the Thermopower in Carbon Nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Well-known Mott's formula links the thermoelectric power characterised by Seebeck coefficient to conductivity. We calculate analytically the thermoelectric current and Seebeck coefficient in one-dimensional systems and show that, while the prediction of Mott's formula is valid for Dirac fermions, it is misleading for the carriers having a parabolic dispersion. We apply the developed formalism to metallic single wall carbon nanotubes and obtain a non-trivial non-monotonic dependence of the Seebeck coefficient on the chemical potential. We emphasize that, in contrast to Mott's formula, the classical Kelvin's formula that links thermoelectric power to the temperature derivative of the chemical potential is perfectly valid in carbon nanotubes in the ballistic regime. Interestingly, however, the Kelvin's formula fails in two- and three-dimensional systems in the ballistic regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density in many-body systems undergoing quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential $\mu$. They originate from a nontrivial interplay between noncritical short-range and critical long-range quantum fluctuations. As a paradigmatic model we consider the one-dimensional fermionic Kitaev chain, for which very accurate numerical studies can be performed, up to $O(10^4)$ sites. The search for dynamic scaling behaviors of the particle density is complicated by the fact that its equilibrium (ground state) behavior is dominated by short-range fluctuations, giving rise to regular background terms and peculiar logarithmic terms from resonances between renormalization-group perturbations associated with the energy and identity operator families within the conformal field theory. To study these issues, we focus on two dynamic protocols, either instantaneous quenches or quasi-adiabatic changes of $\mu$ to the critical value $\mu_c$, unveiling out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors of the particle density, which arise from the critical modes, within a dynamic finite-size scaling framework.</description>
