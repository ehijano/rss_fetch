      <title>On the Houdr\'e-Tetali conjecture about an isoperimetric constant of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Houdr\'e and Tetali defined a class of isoperimetric constants $\varphi_p$ of graphs for $0 \leq p \leq 1$, and conjectured a Cheeger-type inequality for $\varphi_\frac12$ of the form $$\lambda_2 \lesssim \varphi_\frac12 \lesssim \sqrt{\lambda_2}$$ where $\lambda_2$ is the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian matrix. If true, the conjecture would be a strengthening of the hard direction of the classical Cheeger's inequality. Morris and Peres proved Houdr\'e and Tetali's conjecture up to an additional log factor, using techniques from evolving sets. We present the following related results on this conjecture.
  - We provide a family of counterexamples to the conjecture of Houdr\'e and Tetali, showing that the logarithmic factor is needed.
  - We match Morris and Peres's bound using standard spectral arguments.
  - We prove that Houdr\'e and Tetali's conjecture is true for any constant $p$ strictly bigger than $\frac12$, which is also a strengthening of the hard direction of Cheeger's inequality.
  Furthermore, our results can be extended to directed graphs using Chung's definition of eigenvalues for directed graphs.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithms achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single-threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we extend this result to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), and to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>Approximating branchwidth on parametric extensions of planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The branchwidth of a graph has been introduced by Roberson and Seymour as a measure of the tree-decomposability of a graph, alternative to treewidth. Branchwidth is polynomially computable on planar graphs by the celebrated ``Ratcatcher''-algorithm of Seymour and Thomas. We investigate an extension of this algorithm to minor-closed graph classes, further than planar graphs, as follows: Let $H_{1}$ be a graph embeddable in the torus and $H_{2}$ be a graph embeddable in the projective plane. We prove that every $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graph $G$ contains a subgraph $G'$ where the difference between the branchwidth of $G$ and the branchwidth of $G'$ is bounded by some constant, depending only on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$. Moreover, the graph $G'$ admits a tree decomposition where all torsos are planar. This decomposition can be used for deriving a constant-additive approximation for branchwidth: For $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graphs, there is a constant $c$ (depending on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$) and an $\Ocal(|V(G)|^{3})$-time algorithm that, given a graph $G$, outputs a value $b$ such that the branchwidth of $G$ is between $b$ and $b+c$.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Diameter on H-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensively studied Diameter problem is to find the diameter of a given connected graph. We investigate, for the first time in a structured manner, the complexity of Diameter for H-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain a fixed graph H as an induced subgraph. We first show that if H is not a linear forest with small components, then Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests H, we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values. If H is a linear forest, the maximum value of the diameter of any graph in a connected H-free graph class is some constant dmax dependent only on H. We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax, for several linear forests H. In contrast, for one such linear forest H, Diameter cannot be solved in subquadratic time for H-free graphs under SETH. Moreover, we even show that, for several other linear forests H, one cannot decide in subquadratic time if a connected H-free graph has diameter dmax under SETH.</description>
