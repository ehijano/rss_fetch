      <title>Robust Approximate Characterization of Single-Cell Heterogeneity in Microbial Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live-cell microscopy allows to go beyond measuring average features of cellular populations to observe, quantify and explain biological heterogeneity. Deep Learning-based instance segmentation and cell tracking form the gold standard analysis tools to process the microscopy data collected, but tracking in particular suffers severely from low temporal resolution. In this work, we show that approximating cell cycle time distributions in microbial colonies of C. glutamicum is possible without performing tracking, even at low temporal resolution. To this end, we infer the parameters of a stochastic multi-stage birth process model using the Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood method at varying temporal resolutions by subsampling microscopy sequences, for which ground truth tracking is available. Our results indicate, that the proposed approach yields high quality approximations even at very low temporal resolution, where tracking fails to yield reasonable results.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the non-monotonic behavior of mutual information along biochemical reaction cascades</title>

Abstract: Cells sense environmental signals and transmit information intracellularly through changes in the abundance of molecular components. Such molecular abundances can be measured in single cells and exhibit significant heterogeneity in clonal populations even in identical environments. Experimentally observed joint probability distributions can then be used to quantify the covariability and mutual information between molecular abundances along signaling cascades. However, because stationary state abundances along stochastic biochemical reaction cascades are not conditionally independent, their mutual information is not constrained by the data processing inequality. Here, we report the conditions under which the mutual information between stationary state abundances increases along a cascade of biochemical reactions. This non-monotonic behavior can be intuitively understood in terms of noise propagation and time-averaging stochastic fluctuations that are short-lived compared to an extrinsic signal. Our results re-emphasize that mutual information measurements of stationary state distributions of cellular components may be of limited utility for characterizing cellular signaling processes because they do not measure information transfer.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation, such as Sox9. It represses female-determining pathways and ovarian formation by silencing Foxl2. Across 127 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, prior to and during gonadal sex differentiation and in adult testes, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and reptile. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10) but has no sex-specific splicing variants in any taxa, which is in sharp contrast to the constitutional sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve and the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>
