      <title>Femtosecond-and-atom-resolved solvation dynamics of a Na$^+$ ion in a helium nanodroplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown how the primary steps of solvation of a single Na$^+$ ion, instantly created at the surface of a nanometer-sized droplet of liquid helium, can be followed at the atomic level [Albrectsen et al. Nature $\textbf{623}$, 319 (2023)]. This involved measuring, with femtosecond time resolution, the gradual attachment of individual He atoms to the Na$^+$ ion as well as the energy dissipated from the local region of the ion. In the current work, we provide a more comprehensive and detailed description of the experimental findings of the solvation dynamics, and present an improved Poisson-statistical analysis of the time-resovled yields of the solvation complexes, Na$^+$He$_n$. For droplets containing an average of 5200 He atoms, this analysis gives a binding rate of $1.84\pm0.09$ atoms/ps for the binding of the first five He atoms to the Na$^+$ ion. Also, thanks to accurate heoretical values for the evaporation energies of the Na$^+$He$_n$ complexes, obtained by Path Integral Monte Carlo methos using a new potential energy surface presented here for the first time, we improved the determination of the time-dependent removal of the solvation energy from the region around the sodium ion. We find that it follows Newton's law of cooling for the first 6 ps. Measurements were carried out for three different average droplet sizes, $\langle N_D\rangle = $ 9000, 5200 and 3600 helium atoms, and differences between these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Size effect on polarization bremsstrahlung emission from xenon clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the spectral distribution of the absolute differential cross section of both ordinary and polarization ultra-soft X-ray bremsstrahlung for 0.7 keV electrons scattered on substrate-free nanoclusters of xenon. Clusters were produced in a supersonic gas jet expanding adiabatically into a vacuum. An original method based on absolute measurements of the intensity of the atom and cluster emission in the vacuum ultraviolet and ultra-soft X-ray spectral regions was used to determine the cluster density in the scattering area. The bremsstrahlung arising from scattering of electrons on clusters had a polarization component which dominated the differential cross section. For the first time, cluster size effect on the formation of the polarization bremsstrahlung was found for xenon.</description>
