      <title>Towards physics-informed neural networks for landslide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, solutions to regional scale landslide prediction have mostly relied on data-driven models, by definition, disconnected from the physics of the failure mechanism. The success and spread of such tools came from the ability to exploit proxy variables rather than explicit geotechnical ones, as the latter are prohibitive to acquire over broad landscapes. Our work implements a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach, thereby adding to a standard data-driven architecture, an intermediate constraint to solve for the permanent deformation typical of Newmark slope stability methods. This translates into a neural network tasked with explicitly retrieving geotechnical parameters from common proxy variables and then minimize a loss function with respect to the available coseismic landside inventory. The results are very promising, because our model not only produces excellent predictive performance in the form of standard susceptibility output, but in the process, also generates maps of the expected geotechnical properties at a regional scale. Such architecture is therefore framed to tackle coseismic landslide prediction, something that, if confirmed in other studies, could open up towards PINN-based near-real-time predictions.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional AI-trained correction to the 1D approximate model for Airborne TDEM sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational resources required to solve the full 3D inversion of time-domain electromagnetic data are immense. To overcome the time-consuming 3D simulations, we construct a surrogate model, more precisely, a data-driven statistical model to replace the 3D simulations. It is trained on 3D data and predicts the approximate output much faster. We construct a surrogate model that predicts the discrepancy between a 1D subsurface model and a deviation of the 1D assumption. The latter response is fastly computable with a semi-analytical 1D forward model. We exemplify the approach on a two-layered case. The results are encouraging even with few training samples. Given the computational cost related to the 3D simulations, there are limitations in the number of training samples that can be generated. In addition, certain applications require a wide range of parameters to be sampled, such as the electrical conductivity parameters in a saltwater intrusion case. The challenge of this work is achieving the best possible accuracy with only a few thousand samples. We propose to view the performance in terms of learning gain, representing the gain from the surrogate model whilst still acknowledging a residual discrepancy. Our works open new avenues for effectively simulating 3D TDEM data.</description>

      <title>Minimax polynomial ECEF to geodetic coordinate transformation approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimax polynomial ECEF to geodetic coordinate transformation approximations are presented, including often preferable n-vector versions and pseudo-code implementations. The approximations provide high accuracy-to-computational-cost tunability and an unprecedented low latency down to an accuracy of $\sim10^{-5}$m, which is demonstrated in an extensive benchmark. This sets a new standard for coarse and fast ECEF to geodetic coordinate transformations and opens up a new realm of further improvement opportunities and extensions to other geodetic quantities.</description>

      <title>A Test-Time Learning Approach to Reparameterize the Geophysical Inverse Problem with a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularization is critical for solving ill-posed geophysical inverse problems. Explicit regularization is often used, but there are opportunities to explore the implicit regularization effects that are inherent in a Neural Network structure. Researchers have discovered that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture inherently enforces a regularization that is advantageous for addressing diverse inverse problems in computer vision, including de-noising and in-painting. In this study, we examine the applicability of this implicit regularization to geophysical inversions. The CNN maps an arbitrary vector to the model space. The predicted subsurface model is then fed into a forward numerical simulation to generate corresponding predicted measurements. Subsequently, the objective function value is computed by comparing these predicted measurements with the observed measurements. The backpropagation algorithm is employed to update the trainable parameters of the CNN during the inversion. Note that the CNN in our proposed method does not require training before the inversion, rather, the CNN weights are estimated in the inversion process, hence this is a test-time learning (TTL) approach. In this study, we choose to focus on the Direct Current (DC) resistivity inverse problem, which is representative of typical Tikhonov-style geophysical inversions (e.g. gravity, electromagnetic, etc.), to test our hypothesis. The experimental results demonstrate that the implicit regularization can be useful in some DC resistivity inversions. We also provide a discussion of the potential sources of this implicit regularization introduced from the CNN architecture and discuss some practical guides for applying the proposed method to other geophysical methods.</description>
