      <title>Guarding Offices with Maximum Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem with vertex guards and rectangular visibility ($r$-visibility) for a class of orthogonal polygons that reflect the properties of real-world floor plans: these office-like polygons consist of rectangular rooms and corridors. In the dispersive variant of the Art Gallery Problem, the objective is not to minimize the number of guards but to maximize the minimum geodesic $L_1$-distance between any two guards, called the dispersion distance.
  Our main contributions are as follows. We prove that determining whether a vertex guard set can achieve a dispersion distance of $4$ in office-like polygons is NP-complete, where vertices of the polygon are restricted to integer coordinates. Additionally, we present a simple worst-case optimal algorithm that guarantees a dispersion distance of $3$ in polynomial time. Our complexity result extends to polyominoes, resolving an open question posed by Rieck and Scheffer (CGTA 2024). When vertex coordinates are allowed to be rational, we establish analogous results, proving that achieving a dispersion distance of $2+\varepsilon$ is NP-hard for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, while the classic Art Gallery Problem remains solvable in polynomial time for this class of polygons. Furthermore, we give a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm that computes worst-case optimal solutions with a dispersion distance of $2$.
  On the other hand, for the more restricted class of hole-free independent office-like polygons, we propose a dynamic programming approach that computes optimal solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the problem is practically tractable for arbitrary orthogonal polygons. To this end, we compare solvers based on SAT, CP, and MIP formulations. Notably, SAT solvers efficiently compute optimal solutions for randomly generated instances with up to $1600$ vertices in under $15$s.</description>

      <title>NeCGS: Neural Compression for 3D Geometry Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NeCGS, the first neural compression paradigm, which can compress a geometry set encompassing thousands of detailed and diverse 3D mesh models by up to 900 times with high accuracy and preservation of detailed geometric structures. Specifically, we first propose TSDF-Def, a new implicit representation that is capable of \textbf{accurately} representing irregular 3D mesh models with various structures into regular 4D tensors of \textbf{uniform} and \textbf{compact} size, where 3D surfaces can be extracted through the deformable marching cubes. Then we construct a quantization-aware auto-decoder network architecture to regress these 4D tensors to explore the local geometric similarity within each shape and across different shapes for redundancy removal, resulting in more compact representations, including an embedded feature of a smaller size associated with each 3D model and a network parameter shared by all models. We finally encode the resulting features and network parameters into bitstreams through entropy coding. Besides, our NeCGS can handle the dynamic scenario well, where new 3D models are constantly added to a compressed set. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our NeCGS over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

      <title>Power Diagram Enhanced Adaptive Isosurface Extraction from Signed Distance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting high-fidelity mesh surfaces from Signed Distance Fields has become a fundamental operation in geometry processing. Despite significant progress over the past decades, key challenges remain namely, how to automatically capture the intricate geometric and topological structures encoded in the zero level set of SDFs. In this paper, we present a novel isosurface extraction algorithm that introduces two key innovations: 1. An incrementally constructed power diagram through the addition of sample points, which enables repeated updates to the extracted surface via its dual regular Delaunay tetrahedralization; and 2. An adaptive point insertion strategy that identifies regions exhibiting the greatest discrepancy between the current mesh and the underlying continuous surface. As the teaser figure shows, our framework progressively refines the extracted mesh with minimal computational cost until it sufficiently approximates the underlying surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms sofa methods, particularly for models with intricate geometric variations and complex topologies.</description>

      <title>Hardness of computation of quantum invariants on 3-manifolds with restricted topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum invariants in low dimensional topology offer a wide variety of valuable invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, presented by explicit formulas that are readily computable. Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</description>
