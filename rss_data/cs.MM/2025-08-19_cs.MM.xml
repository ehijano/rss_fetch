      <title>Ges-QA: A Multidimensional Quality Assessment Dataset for Audio-to-3D Gesture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Audio-to-3D-Gesture (A2G) task has enormous potential for various applications in virtual reality and computer graphics, etc. However, current evaluation metrics, such as Fr\'echet Gesture Distance or Beat Constancy, fail at reflecting the human preference of the generated 3D gestures. To cope with this problem, exploring human preference and an objective quality assessment metric for AI-generated 3D human gestures is becoming increasingly significant. In this paper, we introduce the Ges-QA dataset, which includes 1,400 samples with multidimensional scores for gesture quality and audio-gesture consistency. Moreover, we collect binary classification labels to determine whether the generated gestures match the emotions of the audio. Equipped with our Ges-QA dataset, we propose a multi-modal transformer-based neural network with 3 branches for video, audio and 3D skeleton modalities, which can score A2G contents in multiple dimensions. Comparative experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that Ges-QAer yields state-of-the-art performance on our dataset.</description>

      <title>CEM-Net: Cross-Emotion Memory Network for Emotional Talking Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional talking face generation aims to animate a human face in given reference images and generate a talking video that matches the content and emotion of driving audio. However, existing methods neglect that reference images may have a strong emotion that conflicts with the audio emotion, leading to severe emotion inaccuracy and distorted generated results. To tackle the issue, we introduce a cross-emotion memory network(CEM-Net), designed to generate emotional talking faces aligned with the driving audio when reference images exhibit strong emotion. Specifically, an Audio Emotion Enhancement module(AEE) is first devised with the cross-reconstruction training strategy to enhance audio emotion, overcoming the disruption from reference image emotion. Secondly, since reference images cannot provide sufficient facial motion information of the speaker under audio emotion, an Emotion Bridging Memory module(EBM) is utilized to compensate for the lacked information. It brings in expression displacement from the reference image emotion to the audio emotion and stores it in the memory.Given a cross-emotion feature as a query, the matching displacement can be retrieved at inference time. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our CEM-Net can synthesize expressive, natural and lip-synced talking face videos with better emotion accuracy.</description>

      <title>MAGNeT: Multimodal Adaptive Gaussian Networks for Intent Inference in Moving Target Selection across Complex Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12992v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving target selection in multimedia interactive systems faces unprecedented challenges as users increasingly interact across diverse and dynamic contexts-from live streaming in moving vehicles to VR gaming in varying environments. Existing approaches rely on probabilistic models that relate endpoint distribution to target properties such as size and speed. However, these methods require substantial training data for each new context and lack transferability across scenarios, limiting their practical deployment in diverse multimedia environments where rich multimodal contextual information is readily available. This paper introduces MAGNeT (Multimodal Adaptive Gaussian Networks), which addresses these problems by combining classical statistical modeling with a context-aware multimodal method. MAGNeT dynamically fuses pre-fitted Ternary-Gaussian models from various scenarios based on real-time contextual cues, enabling effective adaptation with minimal training data while preserving model interpretability. We conduct experiments on self-constructed 2D and 3D moving target selection datasets under in-vehicle vibration conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGNeT achieves lower error rates with few-shot samples by applying context-aware fusion of Gaussian experts from multi-factor conditions.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Regularization over LoRA for Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities? To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA). Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VentusAislant/MSLoRA_CR.</description>

      <title>Next-Gen Education: Enhancing AI for Microlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores integrating microlearning strategies into university curricula, particularly in computer science education, to counteract the decline in class attendance and engagement in US universities after COVID. As students increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures, traditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and effectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable units, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational outcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and scenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like algorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing practice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to create such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of supplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain essential in guiding and shaping the learning process. This AI-enhanced approach ensures course content is kept current with the latest research and technology, with educators providing context and insights. By examining AI capabilities in microlearning, this study shows the potential to transform educational practices and outcomes in computer science, offering a practical model for combining advanced technology with established teaching methods.</description>

      <title>Labels or Input? Rethinking Augmentation in Multimodal Hate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection.</description>

      <title>Singing Syllabi with Virtual Avatars: Enhancing Student Engagement Through AI-Generated Music and Digital Embodiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi. As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes, are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable. Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate students' curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information.</description>

      <title>SimInterview: Transforming Business Education through Large Language Model-Based Simulated Multilingual Interview Training System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business interview preparation demands both solid theoretical grounding and refined soft skills, yet conventional classroom methods rarely deliver the individualized, culturally aware practice employers currently expect. This paper introduces SimInterview, a large language model (LLM)-based simulated multilingual interview training system designed for business professionals entering the AI-transformed labor market. Our system leverages an LLM agent and synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across multiple languages. Built on LLMs (OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, Gemma 3), integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto diffusion-based talking head generation model, and ChromaDB vector databases, our system significantly improves interview readiness across English and Japanese markets. Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging regulatory expectations.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation with Multi-Level Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Audio-Visual Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a cross-modal knowledge distillation (CMKD) framework combined with multi-level data augmentation for low-resource audio-visual (AV) sound event localization and detection (SELD). An audio-only SELD model acts as the teacher, transferring knowledge to an AV student model through both output responses and intermediate feature representations. To enhance learning, data augmentation is applied by mixing features randomly selected from multiple network layers and associated loss functions tailored to the SELD task. Extensive experiments on the DCASE 2023 and 2024 SELD datasets show that the proposed method significantly improves AV SELD performance, yielding relative gains of 22%~36% in the overall metric over the baseline. Notably, our approach achieves results comparable to or better than teacher models trained on much larger datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on both DCASE 2023 and 2024 SELD tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the winning approach for the 1st MultiModal Deception Detection (MMDD) Challenge at the 1st Workshop on Subtle Visual Computing (SVC). Aiming at the domain shift issue across source and target domains, we propose a Multi-source Multimodal Progressive Domain Adaptation (MMPDA) framework that transfers the audio-visual knowledge from diverse source domains to the target domain. By gradually aligning source and the target domain at both feature and decision levels, our method bridges domain shifts across diverse multimodal datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach securing Top-2 place. Our approach reaches 60.43% on accuracy and 56.99\% on F1-score on competition stage 2, surpassing the 1st place team by 5.59% on F1-score and the 3rd place teams by 6.75% on accuracy.

      <title>E3RG: Building Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) is crucial for building emotionally intelligent human-computer interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) have improved text-based ERG, challenges remain in handling multimodal emotional content and maintaining identity consistency. Thus, we propose E3RG, an Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System based on multimodal LLMs which decomposes MERG task into three parts: multimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal response generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video generative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and identity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the superiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing Top-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.

      <title>Has GPT-5 Achieved Spatial Intelligence? An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2) still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.</description>

      <title>Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

Abstract: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.</description>

      <title>Casual3DHDR: Deblurring High Dynamic Range 3D Gaussian Splatting from Casually Captured Videos</title>

Abstract: Photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has gained significant attention for its superior performance. However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous-time camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \textbf{Casual3DHDR} outperforms existing methods in robustness and rendering quality. Our source code and dataset will be available at https://lingzhezhao.github.io/CasualHDRSplat/</description>
