      <title>Marginal Price Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for optimal routing and arbitrage in AMM driven markets. This framework improves on the original best-practice convex optimization by restricting the search to the boundary of the optimal space. We can parameterize this boundary using a set of prices, and a potentially very high dimensional optimization problem (2 optimization variables per curve) gets reduced to a much lower dimensional root finding problem (1 optimization variable per token, regardless of the number of the curves). Our reformulation is similar to the dual problem of a reformulation of the original convex problem. We show our reformulation of the problem is equivalent to the original formulation except in the case of infinitely concentrated liquidity, where we provide a suitable approximation. Our formulation performs far better than the original one in terms of speed - we obtain an improvement of up to 200x against Clarabel, the new CVXPY default solver - and robustness, especially on levered curves.</description>

      <title>The Relative Entropy of Expectation and Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As operators acting on the undetermined final settlement of a derivative security, expectation is linear but price is non-linear. When the market of underlying securities is incomplete, non-linearity emerges from the bid-offer around the mid price that accounts for the residual risks of the optimal funding and hedging strategy. At the extremes, non-linearity also arises from the embedded options on capital that are exercised upon default. In this essay, these convexities are quantified in an entropic risk metric that evaluates the strategic risks, which is realised as a cost with the introduction of bilateral margin. Price is then adjusted for market incompleteness and the risk of default caused by the exhaustion of capital.
  In the complete market theory, price is derived from a martingale condition. In the incomplete market theory presented here, price is instead derived from a log-martingale condition: \begin{equation} p_t=-\frac{1}{\alpha}\log\mathbb{E}_t\exp[-\alpha p_T] \notag \end{equation} for the price $p$ of a funded and hedged derivative security, where the price measure $\mathbb{E}$ has minimum entropy relative to economic expectations, and the parameter $\alpha$ is determined from the risk appetite of the investor. This price principle is easily applied to standard models for market evolution, with applications considered here including model risk analysis, deep hedging and decentralised finance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Families of Fractional Stochastic Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduced by M\"uller et al. in their seminal paper \cite{muller}, fractional stochastic dominance (SD) offers a nuanced approach to ordering distributions. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new framework by replacing the fixed parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$ in fractional SD with a function $\boldsymbol{\gamma}: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$. This yields two novel families, multi-fractional stochastic dominance (MFSD) and functional fractional stochastic dominance (FFSD). They enable the ranking of a broader range of distributions and incorporate a more informative utility class, including those with local non-concavities whose steepness varies depending on the location. Furthermore, our framework introduces the concept of partial greediness, which dynamically captures how behaviour of decision makers adapts to changes in wealth. We also extend this framework to encompass almost stochastic dominance. We provide the mathematical foundations of our generalized framework and study how it offers a novel tool for ordering distributions across various settings.</description>

      <title>am-AMM: An Auction-Managed Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03367v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as the dominant market mechanism for trading on decentralized exchanges implemented on blockchains. This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The ``auction-managed AMM'' works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as ``pool manager'' for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM.</description>
