      <title>Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for an Anderson transition in a disordered system with non-reciprocal hopping to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges are localized at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which the charges are localized at random positions. In periodic boundary conditions, the skin effect gives way to a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If additional multipole moments like dipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable for any amount of disorder. As a result, under periodic boundary conditions, the system is always delocalized regardless of disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Synaptogenesis Implemented on a Nanomagnetic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain functions very differently from artificial neural networks (ANN) and possesses unique features that are absent in ANN. An important one among them is "adaptive synaptogenesis" that modifies synaptic weights when needed to avoid catastrophic forgetting and promote lifelong learning. The key aspect of this algorithm is supervised Hebbian learning, where weight modifications in the neocortex driven by temporal coincidence are further accepted or vetoed by an added control mechanism from the hippocampus during the training cycle, to make distant synaptic connections highly sparse and strategic. In this work, we discuss various algorithmic aspects of adaptive synaptogenesis tailored to edge computing, demonstrate its function using simulations, and design nanomagnetic hardware accelerators for specific functions of synaptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic thresholds in combinatorial optimization depend on the time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades, many efforts have focused on analyzing typical-case hardness in optimization and inference problems. Some recent work has pointed out that polynomial algorithms exist, running with a time that grows more than linearly with the system size, which can do better than linear algorithms, finding solutions to random problems in a wider range of parameters. However, a theory for polynomial and superlinear algorithms is in general lacking. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a standard, versatile, and robust choice for solving optimization and inference problems, in the prototypical random $K$-Sat problem. For the first time, we show that the algorithmic thresholds depend on the time scaling of the algorithm with the size of the system. Indeed, one can identify not just one, but different thresholds for linear, quadratic, cubic regimes (and so on). This observation opens new directions in studying the typical case hardness in optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Compositional Effects on Structure, Dynamics, Thermodynamic and Mechanical Properties of Zr-Cu-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zr-Cu-Al alloys belong to a commercially important family of CuZr-based alloys that form bulk metallic glasses on microalloying of Al. However, the identification of compositions with good glass-forming ability and desirable properties from a vast compositional space remains a major challenge due to complex compositional effects on the structure, dynamics and properties. In the present work, we report molecular dynamic investigations of structure, dynamics, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ and Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ alloys ($x=5,10,15,20,25,30,40$) covering a wide compositional space. Our results and findings lead to some important conclusions that could serve as overarching guidelines for choosing good glass-forming alloy compositions that give Zr-Cu-Al glasses with tailored thermal and mechanical properties. Overall, present results suggest that a good glass-forming Zr-Cu-Al alloy composition leading to an MG with good thermal and mechanical properties should be Cu-rich with Zr concentration in the window 30\%-35\% and Al\% &gt; 20. Our results also highlight the impact of icosahedral short- and medium-range ordering on the dynamics and mechanical properties of the alloys. It is observed that the fractions of the full icosahedra $\langle 0,0,12,0 \rangle$ and the degree of their interconnectivity are directly correlated to the structural relaxation, diffusion, dynamic heterogeneity and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Crystal nucleation and growth in high-entropy alloys revealed by atomic electron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) balance mixing entropy and intermetallic phase formation enthalpy, creating a vast compositional space for structural and functional materials (1-6). They exhibit exceptional strength-ductility trade-offs in metallurgy (4-10) and near-continuum adsorbate binding energies in catalysis (11-16). A deep understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs is essential for controlling their formation and optimizing their structural and functional properties. However, atomic-scale nucleation in HEAs challenges traditional theories based on one or two principal elements (17-23). The intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple principal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways (5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale observations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect measurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive. Here, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic structure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy nuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that decreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As nuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce without misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain these experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways model, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through multiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only provide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but also offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other materials.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in monitored quantum dynamics are non-equilibrium phase transitions between quantum-chaotic (volume-law entangled) and entanglement-suppressed, area-law phases. We reveal how monitored dynamics are situated within the framework of general far-from-equilibrium, quantum condensed-matter physics. Measurement-induced heating effects scramble the distribution function in generic (interacting) monitored fermion systems, which enables a simplified symmetry-based description of the dynamics. We demonstrate the equivalence of the Keldysh technique with the conventional Statistical-Mechanics Model for circuits, resulting from a doubled Hilbert-space (Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski) mapping. We illustrate this using the monitored dynamics of interacting fermions with a conserved charge, deriving a unified effective field theory that captures all phases and phase transitions. The non-interacting counterpart in 1D space only has an area-law phase, with no MIPT. This was explained via an effective non-linear sigma model replica field theory possessing a very large symmetry. We show that other phases and phase transitions emerge when the replica symmetry is reduced by interactions. The reduced symmetry combines a replica permutation symmetry and charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT, which can be recognized via a separatrix in the renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the ``charge-sharpening" transition between two kinds of dynamics, where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the measurements. The field theory explains why the charge-sharpening transition should occur only in the volume-law phase. Our framework provides a template for other classes of MIPTs and situates these within the arena of non-equilibrium condensed matter physics.</description>
