      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>

      <title>Can Alfv\'enic Fluctuations Affect the Correlation and Complexity of Magnetic Fields in Magnetic Ejecta? A Case Study Based on Multi-Spacecraft Measurements at 1~au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether Alfv\'enic fluctuations (AFs) can affect the structure of magnetic ejecta (MEs) within interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We study an ICME observed on 2001 December 29 at 1 au by ACE and Wind, at a total angular separation of $\sim$0.8$^\circ$ ($\sim0.014$~au). We focus on the correlation and complexity of its magnetic structure measured between two spacecraft in association with large-amplitude AFs. The Alfv\'enicity of the ME is investigated in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations. We find that as for the event of interest, large-amplitude AFs occur in the rear region of the ME at both Wind and ACE with a duration of about six hours. We compare the correlation of the magnetic field strength and vector components measured between Wind and ACE, and investigate complexity in terms of the magnetic hodograms. The region showing AFs is found to be associated with a decreased correlation of the magnetic field components and an increased complexity of the ME magnetic configuration detected at ACE and Wind, which may be due to the fact that the two spacecraft crossing the same ME along different trajectories likely sampled AFs in different oscillation phases. Combining multi-point in-situ measurements and remote-sensing observations of the ICME source region, we further discuss different potential sources of the AFs.</description>

      <title>A study of the transition to a turbulent shock using a coarse-graining approach to ion phase space transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shocks and turbulence are ubiquitous phenomena, responsible for particle acceleration to very high energies in a large collection of astrophysical systems. Using self-consistent, hybrid-kinetic simulations with and without pre-existing turbulence, we study the transition of a shock from ``laminar'' to turbulent. We show that the changes in upstream proton transport behaviour are crucial to understand this transition, which we address quantitatively with a novel Eulerian approach. This method, based on the coarse-graining of the Vlasov equation originally introduced in one of our previous studies, gives consistent results for inertial range scales. The potential applications of the coarse-graining approach beyond the shock-turbulence system are outlined.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar wind transport model parameters using Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply nested-sampling (NS) Bayesian analysis [AshtonEA22] to a model for the transport of MHD-scale solar wind fluctuations. The dual objectives are to obtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport model (TTM) and to support comparisons of distinct versions of the TTM. The TTMs analysed are essentially 1D steady-state presented in [BreechEA08] that describe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized cross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in prescribed background solar wind fields. Modelled effects present in the TTM include nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection associated with pickup-ions. These effects involve adjustable parameters that we seek to constrain. Bayesian analysis supports the efficient searching of a parameter space for the 'best' set of TTM parameter values. More advanced use provides the parameter's posterior distribution: its probability given the data, and the model. This can be used to understand the uncertainty in the provided 'best' values for the parameters and therefore the uncertainty in the suggested TTM solutions/predictions. By using NS, we can calculate the Bayesian evidence for each TTM and objectively determine which best fits the given observational data. Based on the analysis of the datasets and TTM employed, we recommend use of the 2D TTM with von Karman-Howarth parameters ${\alpha}\approx 0.16$ and $\beta \approx 0.10$ and parameter assumptions from existing literature. It is important to include the pickup ion effects in the lengthscale evolution equation by assuming $Z^{2\beta/\alpha}\lambda = const$ is locally conserved. This work is readily extended to more sophisticated solar wind models. Although more work is required to generate datasets with associated errors, which is necessary for accurate Bayesian modelling.</description>

      <title>RatanSunPy: A robust preprocessing pipeline for RATAN-600 solar radio observations data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of observational technologies and software for processing and visualizing spectro-polarimetric microwave data obtained with the RATAN-600 radio telescope opens new opportunities for studying the physical characteristics of solar plasma at the levels of the chromosphere and corona. These levels remain some difficult to detect in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges. The development of such methods allows for more precise investigation of the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the processes occurring in these layers. The obtained data also can be utilized for diagnosing solar plasma and forecasting solar activity. However, using RATAN-600 data requires extensive data processing and familiarity with the RATAN-600. This paper introduces RatanSunPy, an open-source Python package developed for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing multi-band radio observations of the Sun from the RATAN-600 solar complex. The package offers comprehensive data processing functionalities, including direct access to raw data, essential processing steps such as calibration and quiet Sun normalization, and tools for analyzing solar activity. This includes automatic detection of local sources, identifying them with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) active regions, and further determining parameters for local sources and active regions. By streamlining data processing workflows, RatanSunPy enables researchers to investigate the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere more efficiently, contributing to advancements in solar physics and space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by Kp (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions was revealed using Potential Learning (PL). We also discussed dependence of particular solar wind plasma density on moderate geomagnetic conditions. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity solar wind density begins to control Kp. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp under southward IMF conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the 22 years' OMNI solar wind database were used as the inputs. PL extracted the solar wind velocity as the most significant, and further solar wind number density was the second most influential parameter for the moderate Kp under southward IMF conditions. This result was the same as the previous PL result in relation between extremely low and high Kp for southward IMF. Based on statistical investigations using solar wind speed and plasma density database used in PL under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions remain high while the plasma number density becomes large, even if the solar wind velocity is slow. This shows that not only solar wind velocity but also plasma density plays a crucial role in causing geomagnetic disturbances, following empirical relation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. The results obtained from PL and incidental statistical investigations using the PL database suggest that the solar wind density begins to affect Kp from moderate geomagnetic activity even under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>
