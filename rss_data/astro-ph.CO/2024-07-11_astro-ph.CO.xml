      <title>Evidence for large baryonic feedback at low and intermediate redshifts from kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with ACT and DESI photometric galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in cosmological observations have provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the distribution of baryons relative to the underlying matter. In this work, we robustly show that the gas is much more extended than the dark matter at 40$\sigma$ and the amount of baryonic feedback at $z \lesssim 1$ strongly disfavors low-feedback models such as that of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG compared with high-feedback models such as that of the original Illustris simulation. This has important implications for bridging the gap between theory and observations and understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, a better grasp of the baryon-dark matter link is critical to future cosmological analyses, which are currently impeded by our limited knowledge of baryonic feedback. Here, we measure the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), stacked on the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging survey. This is the first analysis to use photometric redshifts for reconstructing galaxy velocities. Due to the large number of galaxies comprising the DESI imaging survey, this is the highest signal-to-noise stacked kSZ measurement to date: we detect the signal at 13$\sigma$ and find that the gas is more spread out than the dark matter at $\sim$40$\sigma$. Our work opens up the possibility to recalibrate large hydrodynamical simulations using the kSZ effect. In addition, our findings point towards a way of alleviating inconsistencies between weak lensing surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as the `low $S_8$' tension, and shed light on long-standing enigmas in astrophysics such as the `missing baryon' problem.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using strong gravitational lensing time delays and Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia ($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</description>

      <title>Signature flips in time-varying $\Lambda(t)$ cosmological models with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate signature flips within the framework of cosmological models featuring a time-varying vacuum energy term $\Lambda(t)$. Specifically, we consider the power-law form of $\Lambda=\alpha H^n$, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are constants. To constrain the model parameters, we use the MCMC technique, allowing for effective exploration of the model's parameters. We apply this approach to analyze 31 points of observational Hubble Data (OHD), 1048 points from the Pantheon data, and additional CMB data. We consider three scenarios: when $n$ is a free parameter (Case I), when $n=0$ (Case II), and when $n=1$ (Case III). In our analysis across all three cases, we observe that our model portrays the universe's evolution from a matter-dominated decelerated epoch to an accelerated epoch, as indicated by the corresponding deceleration parameter. In addition, we investigate the physical behavior of total energy density, total EoS parameter, and jerk parameter. Our findings consistently indicate that all cosmological parameters predict an accelerated expansion phase of the universe for all three cases ($q_0&lt;0$, $\omega_0&lt;-\frac{1}{3}$, $j_0&gt;0$). Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the $Om(z)$ diagnostics for Cases I and III align with the quintessence region, while Case II corresponds to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Litmus tests of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and model-independent measurement of $H_0r_\mathrm{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this analysis we apply a model-independent framework to test the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using simulated SNIa data from the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and combined with simulated Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) five-years Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion history from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates a comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy. The analysis is conducted under three different mock true cosmologies: a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe, a universe with a notable curvature ($\Omega_{k,0} = 0.1$), and one with dynamically evolving dark energy. Each cosmology demonstrates different kinds and varying degrees of deviation from the standard model predictions. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain cosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\Omega_{k0}$) and $H_0 r_\mathrm{d}$, with a precision of approximately 0.52\% for $H_0 r_\mathrm{d}$ and between 0.032 to 0.037 for $\Omega_{k0}$, competitive with current cosmic microwave background constraints, without assuming any form of dark energy.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Preference for Negative Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most precise determination of the sum of neutrino masses from cosmological data, derived from analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), favors a value below the minimum inferred from neutrino flavor oscillation experiments. We explore which data is most responsible of this puzzling aspect of the current constraints on neutrino mass and whether it is related to other anomalies in cosmology. We demonstrate conclusively that the preference for negative neutrino masses is a consequence of larger than expected lensing of the CMB in both the two- and four-point lensing statistics. Furthermore, we show that this preference is robust to changes in likelihoods of the BAO and CMB optical depth analyses given the available data. We then show that this excess clustering is not easily explained by changes to the expansion history and is likely distinct from the preference for for dynamical dark energy in DESI BAO data. Finally, we discuss how future data may impact these results, including an analysis of Planck CMB with mock DESI 5-year data. We conclude that the negative neutrino mass preference is likely to persist even as more cosmological data is collected in the near future.</description>

      <title>Violation of Causality in $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes, we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits cosmological solutions that violate causality. We find that G\"odel-type metrics do not appear to be compatible with this modified gravity theory unless it reduces to the trivial case of symmetric teleparallel gravity, corresponding to $f(Q)=AQ+B$, which is equivalent to general relativity. For $f(Q)$ more general than linear, the theory seems endowed with some chronology protection mechanism that shields it from G\"odel-like causality violations.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and Green's functions in black hole space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in deciphering gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary systems. They are usually quantified by a set of complex coefficients which include tidal Love numbers, describing the conservative response to an external perturbation. In the static case, these are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity in four space-time dimensions, and recently they have been generalized to dynamical interactions. In the context of response theory, the retarded Green's function provides the complete description of the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work we investigate the relation between Love numbers and Green's functions, and highlight the relevance of radiation reaction effects to their connection. As a special case, we discuss BTZ black holes, where the absence of radiative modes allows us to make a direct link between them.</description>

      <title>Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than its host halo, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of merger histories in the population of Insitu stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of insitu stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define insitu stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinize correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unraveling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

Abstract: The Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment at Night (LuSEE-Night) is a project designed to investigate the feasibility of observing the Cosmic Dark Ages using an instrument on the lunar far-side. LuSEE-Night will measure the redshifted 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen over a frequency range of 0.1-50 MHz, covering the redshift range 27 &lt; z &lt; 1100. The LuSEE-Night instrument is a radio frequency spectrometer, consisting of four horizontal monopole antennas, arranged to give wide zenith-pointing beams with two orthogonal linear polarizations. This combination of polarization, spectral, and angular sensitivity will be necessary to separate the cosmological signal from significantly stronger foreground emissions. LuSEE-Night will observe in drift scan during lunar night while the moon shields it from radio frequency interference from both the Earth and sun, and will transmit science and telemetry data back to Earth via an orbital relay during the lunar day. LuSEE-Night will have to operate in a challenging environment: its electronics must operate under hard radiation, the instrument must be thermally isolated during the cold 100~K lunar night, and have a thermal rejection path to survive the 390~K daytime temperature, and its photovoltaic and battery systems must provide sufficient power to operate during two weeks of lunar night. Furthermore, the instrument spectrometer must be powered throughout the lunar night using only a 7~kWh battery, due to mass limitations. Here we describe the power generation, storage, and delivery subsystems of the LuSEE-Night instrument, and the simulations which were performed to design the power subsystems and ensure instrument survival and operation throughout the long lunar night. We also describe the Concept of Operations (ConOps) developed for the LuSEE-Night mission, which derives from the power management simulations.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that would produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>Coordinated JWST Imaging of Three Distance Indicators in a SN Host Galaxy and an Estimate of the TRGB Color Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boasting a 6.5m mirror in space, JWST can increase by several times the number of supernovae (SNe) to which a redshift-independent distance has been measured with a precision distance indicator (e.g., TRGB or Cepheids); the limited number of such SN calibrators currently dominates the uncertainty budget in distance ladder Hubble constant (H0) experiments. JWST/NIRCAM imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC4536 is used here to preview JWST program GO-1995, which aims to measure H0 using three stellar distance indicators (Cepheids, TRGB, JAGB/carbon stars). Each population of distance indicator was here successfully detected -- with sufficiently large number statistics, well-measured fluxes, and characteristic distributions consistent with ingoing expectations -- so as to confirm that we can acquire distances from each method precise to about 0.05mag (statistical uncertainty only). We leverage overlapping HST imaging to identify TRGB stars, cross-match them with the JWST photometry, and present a preliminary constraint on the slope of the TRGB's F115W-(F115W}-F444W) relation equal to -0.99 +/- 0.16 mag/mag. This slope is consistent with prior slope measurements in the similar 2MASS J-band, as well as with predictions from the BASTI isochrone suite. We use the new TRGB slope estimate to flatten the two-dimensional TRGB feature and measure a (blinded) TRGB distance relative to a set of fiducial TRGB colors, intended to represent the absolute fiducial calibrations expected from geometric anchors such as NGC4258 and the Magellanic Clouds. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that the TRGB can be used as a standardizable candle at the IR wavelengths accessible with JWST.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking from the on-shell perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein Graviton Freeze-In and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In models featuring extra spatial dimensions, particle collisions in the early universe can produce Kaluza-Klein gravitons. Such particles will later decay, potentially impacting the process of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we consider scenarios in which gravity is free to propagate throughout $n$ flat, compactified extra dimensions, while the fields of the Standard Model are confined to a 3+1 dimensional brane. We calculate the production and decay rates of the states that make up the Kaluza-Klein graviton tower and determine the evolution of their abundances in the early universe. We then go on to evaluate the impact of these decays on the resulting light element abundances. We identify significant regions of previously unexplored parameter space that are inconsistent with measurements of the primordial helium and deuterium abundances. In particular, we find that for the case of one extra dimension (two extra dimensions), the fundamental scale of gravity must be $M_{\star} &gt; 2 \times 10^{13} \, {\rm GeV}$ ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{10} \, {\rm GeV}$) unless the temperature of the early universe was never greater than $T \sim 2 \, {\rm TeV}$ ($T \sim 1 \, {\rm GeV}$). For larger values of $n$, these constraints are less stringent. For the case of $n=6$, for example, our analysis excludes all values of $M_{\star}$ less than $\sim 10^{6} \, {\rm GeV}$, unless the temperature of the universe was never greater than $T \sim 3 \, {\rm TeV}$. The results presented here severely limit the possibility that black holes were efficiently produced through particle collisions in the early universe's thermal bath.</description>

      <title>A photo-$z$ cautionary tale: Redshift confirmation of COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-$z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, using 10 bands of JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging data on COSBO-7, Ling et al. (2024) reported a photometric redshift solution of $z\gtrsim7.0$, favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and therefore providing an appealing candidate of the most distant massive DSFG. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in ALMA Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at $z_{\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). The three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the photo-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting NIR-to-mm photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main-sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainty at 0.9$\mu$m, and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20$\mu$m. Notably, we recover a bona-fide $z_{\rm phot}\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\mu$m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared data for photo-$z$ robustness. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling SEDs of DSFGs, cautioning against the reliability of photometric redshifts, as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.</description>

      <title>HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: I. Velocity Anisotropy and Dark Matter Cusp Slope of Draco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze four epochs of HST imaging over 18 years for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We measure precise proper motions (PMs) for hundreds of stars and combine these with existing line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. This provides the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for any dwarf galaxy. These constrain the intrinsic velocity anisotropy and resolve the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. We solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the mass profile. We find the velocity dispersion to be radially anisotropic along the symmetry axis and tangentially anisotropic in the equatorial plane, with a globally-averaged value $\overline{\beta_{\mathrm B}}=-0.20^{+ 0.28}_{- 0.53}$, (where $1 - \beta_{\mathrm B} \equiv \langle v_{\mathrm{ tan}}^2 \rangle / \langle v_{\mathrm{ rad}}^2 \rangle$ in 3D). The logarithmic dark matter (DM) density slope over the observed radial range, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{ dark}}$, is $-0.83^{+ 0.32}_{- 0.37}$, consistent with the inner cusp predicted in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. As expected given Draco's low mass and ancient star formation history, it does not appear to have been dissolved by baryonic processes. We rule out cores larger than 487, 717, 942 pc at respective 1-, 2-, 3-$\sigma$ confidence, thus imposing important constraints on the self-interacting DM cross-section. Spherical models yield biased estimates for both the velocity anisotropy and the inferred slope. The circular velocity at our outermost data point (900 pc) is $24.19^{+ 6.31}_{- 2.97} \ \mathrm{km~s^{-1}}s$. We infer a dynamical distance of $75.37^{+ 4.73}_{- 4.00}$ kpc, and show that Draco has a modest LOS rotation, with $\left&lt;v / \sigma \right&gt; = 0.22 \pm 0.09$. Our results provide a new stringent test of the so-called `cusp-core' problem that can be readily extended to other dwarfs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on gravitational perturbations of black holes in the self-accelerating branch of the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (MTMG). This theory is a healthy extension of GR which displays the feature of massive tensor modes, without additional polarizations, strong-coupling issues nor requiring screening mechanisms. We proceed by implementing a newly developed technique that, instead of considering a second-order Schr\"odinger-like reformulation of perturbation equations, relies on a first-order formulation and solves it asymptotically, before numerically deriving the quasi-normal modes. We find that the black holes of MTMG are stable, and that their quasi-normal modes smoothly differ from the GR ones, for non-vanishing values of the graviton mass. This work hence confirms the fact that GR is a smooth limit of MTMG, and opens the exciting possibility of a clean test, performed for instance by the LISA detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a free field in de Sitter space is enhanced by the squeezing of its modes. We show analytically that the expansion induces a term in the entanglement entropy that depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which may extend beyond the horizon. In cosmology the size of the system can be identified with the size of a spatially finite universe, or with the wavelength of the first mode that exited the horizon in the beginning of inflation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference methodology for Primordial Power Spectrum reconstructions from Large Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Bayesian inference and nested sampling to develop a non-parametric method to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum $P_{\mathcal{R}}(k)$ from Large Scale Structure (LSS) data. The performance of the method is studied by applying it to simulations of the clustering of two different object catalogues, low-$z$ (ELGs) and high-$z$ (QSOs), and considering two different photometric errors. These object clusterings are derived from different templates of the primordial power spectrum motivated by models of inflation: the Standard Model power law characterized by the two parameters $A_s$ and $n_s$; a local feature template; and a global oscillatory template. Our reconstruction method involves sampling $N$ knots in the log $\{k,P_{\mathcal{R}}(k)\}$ plane. We use two statistical tests to examine the reconstructions for signs of primordial features: a global test comparing the evidences and a novel local test quantifying the power of the hypothesis test between the power law model and the marginalized probability over $N$ model. The method shows good performance in all scenarios considered. In particular, the tests show no feature detection for the SM. The method is able to detect power spectrum deviations at a level of $\approx 2\%$ for all considered features, combining either the low-$z$ or the high-$z$ redshift bins. Other scenarios with different redshift bins, photometric errors, feature amplitudes and detection levels are also discussed. In addition, we include a first application to real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy Data Release 4 (SDSS LRG 04), finding no preference for deviations from the primordial power law. The method is flexible, model independent, and suitable for its application to existing and future LSS catalogues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistically energetic, non-thermal population of electrons can give rise to unique CMB spectral distortion signatures which can be significantly different from thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal or $y$-distortion. These signatures depend upon the spectrum of non-thermal electrons, therefore, a detection can inform us about the existence and abundance of non-thermal electrons in our universe. Using public CMB maps and data, we derive upper limits on non-thermal $y$-parameter for a relativistic, power-law electron distribution. With future CMB experiments, we may be in a position to detect or put significantly tighter constraints on these signals which can affect our understanding of non-thermal electron distributions in our universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of `A Big Ring on the Sky' (BR), the second ultra-large large-scale structure (uLSS) found in MgII-absorber catalogues, following the previously reported Giant Arc (GA). In cosmological terms the BR is close to the GA - at the same redshift $z \sim 0.8$ and with a separation on the sky of only $\sim 12^\circ$. Two extraordinary uLSSs in such close configuration raises the possibility that together they form an even more extraordinary cosmological system. The BR is a striking circular, annulus-like, structure of diameter $\sim 400$ Mpc (proper size, present epoch). The method of discovery is as described in the GA paper, but here using the new MgII-absorber catalogues restricted to DR16Q quasars. Using the Convex Hull of Member Spheres (CHMS) algorithm, we estimate that the annulus and inner absorbers of the BR have departures from random expectations, at the density of the control field, of up to $5.2\sigma$. We present the discovery of the BR, assess its significance using the CHMS, Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), FilFinder and Cuzick &amp; Edwards (CE) methods, show it in the context of the GA+BR system, and suggest some implications for the origins of uLSS and for our understanding of cosmology. For example, it may be that unusual geometric patterns, such as these uLSSs, have an origin in cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and radio quasars through model-independent methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a cosmological-model-independent test on the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) obtained from the compact radio quasars (QSOs) with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift, and three different parameterizations are adopted to quantify the possible deviations from the CDDR. We initially investigate the impacts of the specific prior values for the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa and the linear size scaling factor $l$ from QSOs on the CDDR test, demonstrating that these prior values introduce significant biases in the CDDR test. To avoid the biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $l$ to test CDDR, which treats the fiducial value of a new variable $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\,l$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalize its impact with a flat prior in the statistical analysis. The results show that the CDDR is consistent with the observational data, and QSOs can serve as a powerful tool for testing the CDDR independent of cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 1: MACHOs and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We place limits on dark matter made up of compact objects significantly heavier than a solar mass, such as MACHOs or primordial black holes (PBHs). In galaxies, the gas of such objects is generally hotter than the gas of stars and will thus heat the gas of stars even through purely gravitational interactions. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) maximize this effect. Observations of the half-light radius in UFDs thus place limits on MACHO dark matter. We build upon previous constraints with an improved heating rate calculation including both direct and tidal heating, and consideration of the heavier mass range above $10^4 \, M_\odot$. Additionally we find that MACHOs may lose energy and migrate in to the center of the UFD, increasing the heat transfer to the stars. UFDs can constrain MACHO dark matter with masses between about $10 M_\odot$ and $10^8 M_\odot$ and these are the strongest constraints over most of this range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a group field theory (GFT) for quantum gravity coupled to four massless scalar fields, using these matter fields to define a (relational) coordinate system. We exploit symmetries of the GFT action, in particular under shifts in the values of the scalar fields, to derive a set of classically conserved currents, and show that the same conservation laws hold exactly at the quantum level regardless of the choice of state. We propose a natural interpretation of the conserved currents which implies that the matter fields always satisfy the Klein--Gordon equation in GFT. We then observe that in our matter reference frame, the same conserved currents can be used to extract all components of an effective GFT spacetime metric. Finally, we apply this construction to the simple example of a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe, where we derive an effective Friedmann equation directly from this metric. The Friedmann equation displays a bounce and a late-time limit equivalent to general relativity with a single scalar field. Our proposal goes substantially beyond the GFT literature in which only specific geometric quantities such as the total volume or volume perturbations could be defined, opening up the possibility to study more general geometries as emerging from GFT.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic superstrings and gauge strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a phenomenological comparison of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum expected from cosmic gauge string networks and superstring networks comprised of multiple string types. We show how violations of scaling behavior and the evolution of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe affect the GW spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the GW spectrum from superstrings and gauge strings that are valid for all frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and laser interferometers. We analyze the latest data from PTAs and show that superstring networks are consistent with 32 nHz data from NANOGrav, but are excluded by 3.2 nHz data at $3\sigma$ unless the string coupling $g_s&lt;0.2$ or the strings evolve in only about 10% of the volume of the higher-dimensional space. We also point out that while gauge string networks are excluded by NANOGrav-15 data at $3\sigma$, they are completely compatible with EPTA and PPTA data. Finally, we study correlations between GW signals at PTAs and laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Boundaries of H2O Maser Emission in an X-ray Illuminated Gas Disk ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High precision mapping of H2O megamaser emission from active galaxies has revealed more than a dozen Keplerian H2O maser disks, which enable a ~4% uncertainty estimate of the Hubble constant as well as providing accurate masses for the central black holes. These disks often have well-defined inner and outer boundaries of maser emission on sub-parsec scales. In order to better understand the physical conditions that determine the inner and outer radii of a maser disk, we examine the distributions of gas density and X-ray heating rate in a warped molecular disk described by a power-law surface density profile. For a suitable choice of the disk mass, we find that the outer radius R_out of the maser disk predicted from our model can match the observed value, with R_out mainly determined by the maximum heating rate or the minimum density for efficient maser action, depending on the combination of the Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and disk mass. Our analysis also indicates that the inner radius for maser action is comparable to the dust sublimation radius, suggesting that dust may play a role in determining the inner radius of a maser disk. Finally, our model predicts that H2O gigamaser disks could exist at the centers of high-z quasars, with disk sizes of &gt;~ 10-30 pc.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Spectra of Warm Inflation in $f(Q, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the warm inflationary scenario within the context of the linear version of f (Q, T ) gravity, coupled with both the inflaton scalar field and the radiation field, under the conditions of the strong dissipation regime. First, we calculate the modified Friedmann equations and the modified slow-roll parameters. Subsequently, we apply the slow-roll approximations to derive the scalar power spectrum and the tensor power spectrum. Also, we develop formulations of the scalar and tensor perturbations for the $f(Q, T)$ gravity with the warm inflation scenario. Furthermore, we scrutinize two different forms of the dissipation coefficient, a constant and a function of the inflaton field, to determine the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the temperature for the power-law potential case. By imposing some constraints on the free parameters of the model, we attain results in good agreement with both the Planck 2018 data and the joint Planck, BK15 and BAO data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and consistent results aligned with the Planck 2018 data for the scalar spectral index. In addition, the obtained results are within the range of observational data for the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum. Consequently, we are able to revive the power-law potential that was previously ruled out by observational data. Moreover, for both dissipation coefficients, the model leads to a scalar spectral index with the blue and red tilts in agreement with the WMAP three years data.</description>

      <title>New Synoptic Observations of the Cosmic Optical Background with New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over $0.4\lesssim\lambda\lesssim0.9{~\rm\mu m}.$ The survey comprises 16 high Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way galaxy, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from Planck HFI $350 {~\rm\mu m}$ and $550 {~\rm\mu m}$ intensities, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection ($6.8\sigma$) of the COB at ${\rm 11.16\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 $\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, ${\rm 8.17\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\rm 2.99\pm2.03~ (1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.</description>
