      <title>Proper time expansions and glasma dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earliest phase of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision can be described as a highly populated system of gluons called glasma. The system's dynamics is governed by the classical Yang-Mills equation. Solutions can be found at early times using a proper time expansion. Since the expansion parameter is the time, this method is necessarily limited to the study of early time dynamics. In addition compute time and memory limitations restrict practical calculations to no more than eighth order in the expansion. The result is that the method produces reliable results only for very early times. In this paper we explore several different methods to increase the maximum time that can be reached. We find that, depending slightly on the quantity being calculated, the latest time for which reliable results are obtained can be extended approximately 1.5 times (from $\sim0.05$~fm/$c$ using previous methods to about $0.08$~fm/$c$).</description>

      <title>Excitation energy of fission fragments within nuclear time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number and properties of the neutrons and photons emitted in nuclear fission are directly related to the excitation energy of the fission fragments when they are formed at scission. Though not observable experimentally because of the extremely short time scales, the excitation energy of fission fragments can be predicted by microscopic theory based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Initial results on the value of the total kinetic energy of fission reactions were very promising, but could not probe all possible fragmentations. In this work, we perform large-scale TDDFT calculations in $^{240}$Pu enabled by the development of a new TDDFT solver. We obtain TDDFT trajectories covering nearly all possible fragmentations. We find that the total kinetic energy is close to experimental values only for the most likely fission while it is severely underestimated at both small and large asymmetries. This conclusion seems rather independent of the parameterization of the energy functional, both in its particle-hole and particle-particle channels.</description>

      <title>A Data-Guided Coalescence Model for Light Nuclei and Hypernuclei: Validation and Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of light hypernuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe hyperon--nucleon interactions and possible three-body forces, which are central to the resolution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star matter. In this work, we develop a data-guided coalescence framework in which the source size is extracted from proton and deuteron yields and used, together with measured proton and $\Lambda$ spectra, to predict the production of $A=3$ nuclei $(t,{}^{3}\rm{He})$ and hypernuclei $({}^{3}_{\Lambda}\rm{H})$. For tritons, calculations with a Gaussian wave function reproduce experimental spectra and yield ratios across a broad collision-energy range. For the hypertriton, the model predictions are highly sensitive to the assumed wave function. This sensitivity is strongest at low collision energies and in low-multiplicity environments, implying that such conditions are particularly valuable for probing hypernuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Scattering of charged particles within Efros method utilizing oscillator series expansion of wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the version of the Efros method utilizing oscillator expansion of wave functions to the Coulomb scattering problem using our recent developments of the HORSE formalism. The approach yields accurate phase shifts and cross sections with significantly reduced computational cost compared to the full HORSE method, while maintaining agreement with exact solutions. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the Efros method and its prospect for applications in ab initio nuclear reaction calculations.</description>

      <title>Transport-based initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions at finite densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the SMASH transport model to provide event-by-event initial conditions for the energy-momentum tensor and conserved charge currents in hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We study the fluctuations and dynamical evolution of three conserved charge currents (net baryon, net electric charges, and net strangeness) with a 4D lattice-QCD-based equation of state, NEOS-4D, in the hydrodynamic phase. Out-of-equilibrium corrections at the particlization are generalized to finite densities to ensure the conservation of energy, momentum, and the three types of charges. These theoretical developments are integrated within X-SCAPE as a unified framework for studying the nuclear matter properties in the Beam Energy Scan program.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the equation of state of cold nuclear matter from imaginary chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sign problem in numerical calculations of the QCD Euclidean space path integral of QCD with a chemical potential vanishes if the chemical potential is imaginary and calculations of the partition function with an imaginary chemical potentials are equivalent to calculations with Lagrange multipliers enforcing the current density. At zero temperature, Lorentz boosts allows one to deduce properties of systems with both number density and and current density from properties of systems with a current density alone; this allows both upper and lower bounds to be determined for the equation of state (EOS) in the form of energy density as a function of number density.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic corrections to high-pT prompt-psi(2S) production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relativistic corrections to prompt psi(2S) at high pT in hadron colliders. Our calculation employs leading-power factorization with Fragmentation Functions (FFs) computed in nonrelativistic QCD and evolved to next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Relativistic corrections increase the cross section significantly for the gluon channel, but moderately for charm. We perform a full analysis of uncertainties. We observe a good agreement with both ATLAS and CMS cross sections without the need of higher-order color-octet contributions. The polar anisotropy is found to be close to CMS data.</description>

      <title>Classification of $g$-modes for neutron stars with a strong transition: Novel universal relation including slow stable twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the non-radial gravity-pulsation discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) in hybrid compact stars with a strong first-order phase transition, which can give rise to twin-star configurations in some cases. These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the moat regime at low energies I: Renormalization and the phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter can feature a moat regime, where the static energy of mesons is minimal at nonzero momentum. Valuable insights into this regime can be gained using low-energy models. This, however, requires a careful assessment of model artifacts. We therefore study the effects of renormalization and in-medium modifications of quark-meson interaction on the moat regime. To capture the main effects, we use a two-flavor quark-meson model at finite temperature and baryon density in the random phase approximation. We put forward a convenient renormalization scheme to account for the nontrivial momentum dependence of meson self-energies and discuss the role of renormalization conditions for renormalization group consistent results on the moat regime. In addition, we demonstrate and that its extent in the phase diagram critically depends on the interaction of quarks and mesons.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the radii of oxygen isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an {\em ab initio} study of the charge and matter radii of oxygen isotopes from $^{16}$O to $^{20}$O using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with high-fidelity N$^3$LO chiral interactions. To efficiently address the Monte Carlo sign problem encountered in nuclear radius calculations, we introduce the {\em partial pinhole algorithm}, significantly reducing statistical uncertainties and extending the reach to more neutron-rich and proton-rich isotopes. Our computed charge radii for $^{16}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{18}$O closely match experimental data, and we predict a charge radius of $2.810(32)$ fm for $^{20}$O. The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-State Independent Relations in Rapidly Rotating Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 22 hadronic and 100 hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that allow for heavy baryons and deconfined quark matter at high densities, aiming to establish quasi-universal relations for both slowly and rapidly rotating neutron stars. All EoSs are consistent with current observational constraints, including NICER and GW170817. Our results confirm that the I-Love-Q and I-C-Q relations remain approximately EoS-insensitive across this broad EoS set, with deviations typically within 10\% for hadronic stars and up to 20\% for those with complex core compositions. These relations are extended to include low-mass neutron stars such as HESS J1731-347, and to stars with general core compositions--nucleonic, hyperonic (full baryon octet), and quark matter. The analysis underscores both the robustness and the limitations of universal relations when applied to compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom and rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>Realistic shell model for ordinary muon capture of sd-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report about a study of the ordinary muon capture in nuclei belonging to the sd shell, an electroweak process that occurs with exchange momenta far larger than ordinary beta decays (approximately 100 MeV). Such a characteristic places this transition in an energy range that is consistent with the neutrinoless double-beta decay, and represents an interesting test for nuclear models to support their predictions of the nuclear matrix elements for such an unobserved process. For the first time, the calculations are carried out within the realistic shell model (RSM), namely employing effective shell-model Hamiltonians and decay operators derived from realistic nuclear forces, without resorting to any empirical adjustment of the coupling constants. This is a chapter of a research program that is aimed to assess the realistic shell model in reproducing the observables related to electroweak processes in nuclei, and then to evaluate the reliability of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double-beta decay that are calculated within this approach. We calculate the partial capture rates for many nuclear systems in the sd-shell region, as well as their spectroscopic properties, and compare the results with the available experimental counterparts. Such a comparison tests the relevance of a microscopic approach to the renormalization of transition operators to reproduce data and provide solid predictions of unknown observables.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of measuring the speed of sound of the quark-gluon plasma from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$; however, we also observe that $\langle p_T \rangle$ and $N$ are not sufficiently accurate proxies for the energy and entropy to make this possible in practice. From simulations, we find that the exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is significantly different whether the ''effective volume'' is strictly constant or not, a condition that cannot be enforced experimentally. Additional tests using a modified equation of state find that the exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ exhibits a variable degree of correlations with the speed of sound and with $P/\varepsilon$, but is not an accurate measurement of either quantity in general.</description>

Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Generation of a scalar vortex in a rotational frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>

      <title>Convergence in charmonium structure: light-front wave functions from basis light-front quantization and Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based -- BLFQ -- and Lagrangian-based -- DSE -- methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-gauge ambiguity in the distributions of energy density, pressure, and shear force inside the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.</description>
