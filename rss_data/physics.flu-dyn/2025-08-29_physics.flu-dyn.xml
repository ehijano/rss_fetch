      <title>On the generation of free-surface waves by instabilities in quadratic shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generation of free-surface waves in a liquid layer driven by linear instabilities in Couette-Poiseuille (quadratic) shear flows. The base velocity profiles are characterized by a curvature parameter, and two-dimensional viscous and inviscid perturbations are analyzed across a wide parameter space of curvature, wavenumber, and Reynolds number, for fixed Froude and Bond numbers. In the inviscid limit, analytical solutions of the Rayleigh equation reveal that velocity profiles ranging from Nusselt to linear flows remain stable against the rippling instability, with long-wave growth occurring only under strong interfacial forcing, whereas weaker forcing produces well-defined stability boundaries. For the viscous problem, Orr-Sommerfeld computations and asymptotic analyses reveal that a slight convex curvature of the shear flow suppresses long-wave instabilities, while a slight concave curvature suppresses short-wave instabilities, so even small deviations from a linear profile produce qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore, we observe that strongly forced long waves are more unstable at large $Re$ than the inviscid value they latch on to as $Re \to \infty$. Growth-rate maps highlight smooth transitions between long-wave and rippling modes and reveal an additional shear instability near the linear profile at high Reynolds numbers. Based on energy transfers and eigenfunction structures, five distinct instability types are identified: shear, rippling, long-wave interfacial, short-wave interfacial, and a composite mode that combines features of shear, rippling and long-wave interfacial instabilities at large Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Temporal Exceeding Probability for Ship Responses in Broadband Wave Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient method to evaluate the temporal exceeding probability of ship motion (percentage of time for the ship motion to be above a given high threshold) in an irregular wave field. Our method builds on our previous work of Gong et al. (Applied Ocean Research, 2022), which converts the calculation into a sampling problem in the space of wave group parameters, within which an acquisition-based sequential sampling method is developed to reduce the number of required samples. Two critical advancements are achieved in this paper relative to that work. (1) We develop a new wave group parameterization method, which allows the framework to be applied to general broadband wave fields. (2) We incorporate the variability regarding each parameterized wave group (e.g. varying wave form and initial condition of the ship encountering the group) into the final estimation of a single value of the temporal exceeding probability. Our complete framework is tested for a ship subject to a wave field with a JONSWAP spectrum, for different ship motion dynamical models, spectral bandwidths, and exceeding thresholds. The results show that for most cases our method provides a result with O(15%) error or below within 210 samples, with the ground truth obtained from a continuous simulation that is more than 2300 times more expensive than our method. We also demonstrate the benefits of sequential sampling (with an acquisition function updated due to (2)) compared to standard random or Latin hypercube (LH) samplings, in terms of the mean error of the results.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Learning Enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Method for Conjugate Heat Transfer Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study aims to develop a non-intrusive Reduced Order Model (ROM) to reconstruct the full temperature field for a large-scale industrial application based on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</description>

      <title>Streak generation in viscosity-stratified wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamwise elongated flow structures, or streaks, dominate wall-bounded flows. We show that the renowned lift-up mechanism, that generates streaks, is significantly altered by viscosity stratification. We additionally identify a novel pathway for streak generation: the viscosity-stratified lift-up mechanism. The competition and cooperation of the streaks generated by these mechanisms provides an explanation for trends in viscosity-stratified Poiseuille flows, and remarkably, the opposing trends in Couette flows as well. Our theoretical observations are substantiated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Extending flow birefringence analysis to combined extensional-shear flows via Jeffery-Hamel flow measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between phase retardation and strain rates in combined extensional-shear flows using the Jeffery-Hamel flow formalism, which yields an analytical velocity solution. Flow birefringence was measured in a 1.0 wt$\%$ cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspension using a high-speed polarization camera. The velocity field was validated via particle image velocimetry (PIV), which showed good agreement with the analytical solution. In regions dominated by either shear or extensional components, the birefringence behavior was consistent with prior theoretical and experimental findings. In the combined extensional-shear regions of the Jeffery-Hamel flow, the birefringence magnitude followed the root-sum-square (RSS) of the shear- and extension-induced contributions. This observation aligns with the principal stress formulation derived from Mohr's circle, in which the principal stress is expressed as the RSS of extensional and shear stresses. This finding provides a basis for extending stress-birefringence analysis to flows with coexisting deformation modes.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Face Coverings for Virus Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional face masks used extensively, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, are relatively impermeable, forcing aerosol-containing breath to flow into the surrounding atmosphere by ``leaking" out from the lateral edges of the mask. This protects close-proximity persons but results in a high viral load being delivered into the air. An alternative face covering, the Virustatic Shield, developed by Virustatic, involves a much more permeable material coated in an active agent, with the goal of increasing the transmission through the mask and thus reducing the viral load released. In this paper, we build and solve a model that describes the air flow and aerosol transport through a porous face mask. Our model for air flow is based on a low-Reynolds-number approximation to the Navier--Stokes equations, and reduces to a two-dimensional scalar partial differential equation for the local flux through the mask. We use the model to explore the interplay between leakage from the mask sides and flow directly through. We compare and contrast the leakage for traditional face masks and for neck gaiters, and find that neck gaiters have a lower leakage. We utilise a simple model for aerosol transport that balances advection with capture by the mask, and find that there is an ideal permeability, which optimises real-world protection offered by the mask.</description>

      <title>A multi-ansatz variational quantum solver for compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Navier--Stokes (NS) equations remains computationally intensive, especially when implicit time integration is used to capture multiscale flow dynamics. This work introduces a hybrid quantum--classical framework for solving the linear systems arising from such implicit schemes in compressible flow simulations. At its core is a variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) enhanced by a multi-ansatz tree architecture, designed to expand the accessible solution space and alleviate training issues such as barren plateaus. The proposed method is evaluated through one-dimensional shock tube simulations implemented on a quantum virtual machine. Results demonstrate that the solver accurately captures shock, rarefaction, and contact discontinuities across a range of test cases. Parametric studies further show that increasing the number of ansatz branches and applying domain decomposition improves convergence and stability, even under limited qubit resources. These findings suggest that multi-ansatz VQLS architectures offer a promising pathway for incorporating quantum computing into computational fluid dynamics (CFD), with compatibility for both current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and future fault-tolerant devices.</description>

      <title>On the attenuation of waves through broken ice of randomly-varying thickness on water of finite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent work of Dafydd and Porter [2024] on the attenuation of waves propagating through floating broken ice of random thickness is extended to consider water of non-shallow depth. A theoretical model of broken floating ice is analysed using a multiple scales analysis to provide an explicit expression for the attenuation of waves as they propagate from a region of constant thickness ice into a semi-infinite region of ice whose thickness is a slowly-varying random function of distance. Theoretical predictions are shown to compare well to numerical simulations of scattering over long finite regions of ice of randomly-varying thickness computed from an approximate depth-averaged model derived under a mild-slope assumption. The theory predicts a low-frequency attenuation proportional to the eighth power of frequency and a roll-over effect at higher frequencies. The relationship between the results and field measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sub-Nanometer Interfacial Hydrodynamics: The Interplay of Interfacial Viscosity and Surface Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an accurate description of nanofluidic systems, it is crucial to account for the transport properties of liquids at surfaces on sub-nanometer scales, where classical hydrodynamics fails due to the finite range of surface-liquid interactions and modifications of the local viscosity. We show how to account for both via generalized, position-dependent surface-friction and interfacial viscosity profiles, which enables the accurate description of interfacial flow on the nanoscale using the Stokes equation. Such profiles are extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of water on polar, non-polar, fluorinated, and unfluorinated alkane and alcohol self-assembled monolayers of widely varying wetting characteristics. Power-law relationships among the Navier friction coefficient, interfacial viscosity excess, and depletion length are revealed, and these are each found to be exponential in the work of adhesion. Our framework forms the basis for describing sub-nanometer fluid flow at interfaces with implications for electrokinetics, biophysics, and nanofluidics.</description>

      <title>Tsunami modeling with dynamic seafloors: a high-order solver validated with shallow water benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor (bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC) methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild (linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or ''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances). Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data. Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for) incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Averaged equations for disperse two-phase flow with interfacial properties and their closures for dilute suspension of droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a derivation of the averaged equations governing the motion of dispersed two-phase flows with interfacial transport. We begin by revisiting the two-fluid formulation, as well as the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation which holds on the entire domain. Following this, a general Lagrangian model is introduced, which accounts for the effects of both internal and interfacial properties of the dispersed inclusions (bubbles, droplets, or particles) within a continuous phase. This is achieved by derivation of conservation laws for particle surface and volume-integrated properties. By summing the internal and interfacial conservation laws, we derive a conservation equation for an arbitrary Lagrangian property associated with the inclusion. We then proceed by deriving the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments of the volume and surface distribution of an arbitrary Lagrangian property. Next, the averaged equations for the dispersed phase are derived through two distinct approaches: the particle-averaged (or Lagrangian-based) formalism, and the phase-averaged method. One important conclusion of this work is the demonstration of the relationship between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equations can be interpreted as a series expansion of the particle-averaged moment equations. We then present a "hybrid" set of equations, consisting of phase-averaged equations for the continuous fluid phase, complemented by an arbitrary number of moment conservation.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Localized Artificial Diffusivity Method for Immiscible and High Density Ratio Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) method is widely regarded as the preferred multi-material regularization scheme for the compact finite difference method, because it is conservative, easy to implement, and generally robust for a wide range of problems. However, traditional LAD methods face significant challenges when applied to flows with large density ratios and when maintaining thermodynamic equilibrium across material interfaces. These limitations arise from the formulation of the artificial diffusivity flux and the reliance on enthalpy diffusion for interface regularization. Additionally, traditional LAD methods struggle to ensure stability for large density ratios, fail to maintain a finite interface thickness, and are therefore unsuitable for modeling immiscible interfaces. In this work, we discuss the origins of these issues in traditional LAD methods and propose modifications which enable the simulation of large density ratio and immiscible flows. The proposed method targets the artificial diffusion fluxes at gradients and ringing in the volume fraction, rather than the mass fraction in traditional methods, to consistently regularize large density ratio interfaces. Furthermore, the proposed method introduces an artificial bulk density diffusion term to enforce equilibrium conditions. To address the challenge of modeling immiscible flows, a conservative diffuse interface term is incorporated to ensure a finite interface thickness. Specific consideration is taken in the method to ensure that these crucial properties are maintained for N-material flows. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of canonical test cases, and its accuracy is validated by comparison with experimental data on microbubble collapse in water. These results highlight the method's robustness and its ability to overcome the limitations of traditional LAD approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Edge-effects in the turbulent flow over flexible aquatic vegetation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riparian vegetation along riverbanks and seagrass along coastlines interact with water currents, significantly altering their flow. To characterise the turbulent fluid motion along the streamwise--edge of a region covered by submerged vegetation (canopy), we perform direct numerical simulations of a half--channel partially obstructed by flexible stems, vertically clamped to the bottom wall. An intense streamwise vortex forms along the canopy edge, drawing high--momentum fluid into the side of the canopy and ejecting low--momentum fluid from the canopy tip, in an upwelling close to the canopy edge. This mechanism has a profound impact on the mean flow and on the exchange of momentum between the fluid and the structure, which we thoroughly characterise. The signature of the canopy--edge vortex is also found in the dynamical response of the stems, assessed for two different values of their flexibility. Varying the flexibility of the stems, we observe how different turbulent structures over the canopy are affected, while the canopy--edge vortex does not exhibit major modifications. Our results provide a better understanding of the flow in fluvial and coastal environments, informing engineering solutions aimed at containing the water flow and protecting banks and coasts from erosion.</description>

Abstract: For homogeneous and isotropic linearly elastic solids and for incompressible fluids under low-Reynolds-number conditions the fundamental solutions of the associated continuum equations were derived a long time ago for bulk systems. That is, the corresponding Green's functions are available in infinitely extended systems, where boundaries do not play any role. However, introducing boundaries renders the situation significantly more complex. Here, we derive the corresponding Green's functions for a linearly elastic homogeneous and isotropic material in a wedge-shaped geometry. Two flat boundaries confine the material and meet at a straight edge. No-slip and free-slip conditions are considered. The force is oriented in a direction parallel to the straight edge of the wedge. Assuming incompressibility, our expressions also apply to the situation of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic viscous fluid flows. Thus, they may be used, for instance, to describe the motion of self-propelled objects guided by an edge or the distortion of soft elastic actuators in wedge-shaped environments of operation.</description>
