      <title>A Mathematical Model for Two Solutes Transport in a Poroelastic Material and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using well-known mathematical foundations of the elasticity theory, a mathematical model for two solutes transport in a poroelastic material (soft tissue is a typical example) is suggested. It is assumed that molecules of essentially different sizes dissolved in fluid and are transported through pores of different sizes. The stress tensor, the main force leading to the material deformation, is taken not only in the standard linear form but also with an additional nonlinear part. The model is constructed in 1D space and consists of six nonlinear equations. It is shown that the governing equations are integrable in stationary case, therefore all steady-state solutions are constructed. The obtained solutions are used in an example for healthy and tumour tissue, in particular, tissue displacements are calculated and compared for parameters taken from experimental data in cases of the linear and nonlinear stress tensors. Since the governing equations are non-integrable in non-stationary case, the Lie symmetry analysis is used in order to construct time-dependent exact solutions. Depending on parameters arising in the governing equations, several special cases with non-trivial Lie symmetries are identified. As a result, multi-parameter families of exact solutions are constructed including those in terms of special functions(hypergeometric and Bessel functions). A possible application of the solutions obtained is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>General Construction of Bra-Ket Formalism for Identical Particle Systems in Rigged Hilbert Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study discussed Dirac's bra-ket formalism for the identical particles system to extend the rigged Hilbert space reformulated by R. Madrid [J. Phys. A:Math. Gen. 37, 8129 (2004)]. The bra and ket vectors for a composite system that form the basis of an identical particle system were reconstructed using the tensor product of rigged Hilbert space.They were found to be characterized in the dual spaces of the tensor product of nuclear spaces. The proofs utilized in this paper adopt a format similar to that used in physics, yet they will be mathematically rigorous. This formulation lays the foundation for modern quantum theories based on perturbation theory, such as quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems and Octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the structures and methods in the theory of causal fermion systems with approaches to fundamental physics based on division algebras, in particular the octonions. We find that octonions and, more generally, tensor products of division algebras come up naturally to describe the symmetries of the vacuum configuration of a causal fermion system. This is achieved by associating the real and imaginary octonion basis elements with the neutrino and charged sectors of the vacuum fermionic projector, respectively. Conversely, causal fermion systems provide octonionic theories with spacetime structures and dynamical equations via the causal action principle. In this way, octonionic theories and causal fermion systems complement each other.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Exact closed forms for the transmittance of electromagnetic waves in one-dimensional anisotropic periodic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain closed expressions for the transfer matrix and the transmittance of electromagnetic waves propagating in finite 1D anisotropic periodic stratified media with an arbitrary number of cells. By invoking the Cayley-Hamilton theorem on the transfer matrix for the electromagnetic field in a periodic stratified media formed by N cells, we obtain a fourth-degree recursive relation for the matrix coefficients that defines the so-called Tetranacci Polynomials. In the symmetric case, corresponding to a unit-cell transfer matrix with a characteristic polynomial where the coefficients of the linear and cubic terms are equal, closed expressions for the solutions to the recursive relation, known as symmetric Tetranacci Polynomials, have recently been derived, allowing us to write the transfer matrix and transmittance in a closed form. We show as sufficient conditions that the $4\times4$ differential propagation matrix of each layer in the binary unit cell, $\Delta$, a) has eigenvalues of the form $\pm p_1$, $\pm p_2$, with $p_1\ne p_2$, and b) its off-diagonal $2\times2$ block matrices possess the same symmetric structure in both layers. Otherwise, the recursive relations are still solvable for any $4\times4$-matrix and provide an algorithm to compute the N-th power of the transfer matrix without carrying out explicitly the matrix multiplication of N matrices. We obtain analytical expressions for the dispersion relation and transmittance, in closed form, for two finite periodic systems: the first one consists of two birefringent uniaxial media with their optical axis perpendicular to the z-axis, and the second consists of two isotropic media subject to an external magnetic field oriented along the z-axis and exhibiting the Faraday effect. Our formalism applies also to lossy media, magnetic anisotropy or optical activity.</description>

      <title>The Odd 2D Bubbles, 4D Triangles, and Einstein and Weyl Anomalies in 2D Gravitational Fermionic amplitudes: The Role of Breaking Integration Linearity for Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated Relations Among Green Functions defined in an alternative strategy for coping with the divergences, also called the Implicit Regularization Method (IREG): the mathematical content (divergent and finite) will remain intact until the calculations end. The divergent part will be organized through standardized objects free of physical quantities. In contrast, the finite part is projected in a class of well-behaved functions that carry all the amplitudes' physical content. That relations arise in fermionic amplitudes in even space-time dimensions, where anomalous tensors connect to finite amplitudes as in the bubbles and triangles in two and four dimensions. Those tensors depend on surface terms, whose non-zero values arise from finite amplitudes as requirements of consistency with the linearity of integration and uniqueness. Maintaining these terms implies breaking momentum-space homogeneity and, in a later step, the Ward identities. Meanwhile, eliminating them allows more than one mathematical expression for the same amplitude. That is a consequence of choices related to the involved Dirac traces. Independently of divergences, it is impossible to satisfy all symmetry implications by simultaneously requiring vanishing surface terms and linearity. Then we approach the 1-loop level fermionic correction for the propagation of the graviton in a space-time D=1+1 through the action of a Weyl fermion in curved space-time. In this context, gravitational anomalies arise, and the amplitudes investigated have the highest degree of divergence quadratic. That imposes a substantial algebraic effort; however, the conclusions are in agreement with the non-gravitational amplitudes. At the end of the calculations, we show how it is possible to fix the value of the divergent part through the relations imposed for amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of a thick open set $\Omega$ in a Euclidean space and show that a local Hardy-Littlewood inequality holds in $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \in (1, \infty]$. We then establish pointwise and $L^p(\Omega)$ convergence for families of convolution operators with a Markov normalization on $\Omega$. We demonstrate application of such smoothing operators to piecewise-continuous density, velocity, and stress fields from discrete element models of sea ice dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give alternative proofs of Bott periodicity of $ K $-theory and the bulk-edge correspondence of integer quantum Hall effect. Regarding Bott periodicity, we connect its proof with configuration spaces and use Quot schemes in algebraic geometry in our proof. Regarding the bulk-edge correspondence, we formulate edge indices based on the consideration of Graf--Porta and give a more elementary and self-contained proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical integrable 1+1 trigonometric ${\rm gl}_N$ Landau-Lifshitz models constructed by means of quantum $R$-matrices satisfying also the associative Yang-Baxter equation. It is shown that 1+1 field analogue of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model is gauge equivalent to the Landau-Lifshitz model, which arises from the Antonov-Hasegawa-Zabrodin trigonometric non-standard $R$-matrix. The latter generalizes the Cherednik's 7-vertex $R$-matrix in ${\rm GL}_2$ case to the case of ${\rm GL}_N$. Explicit change of variables between the 1+1 models is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the decay of strongly excited oscillons in a single vacuum model reveals a chaotic, fractal-like pattern very much like one found in kink-antikink collision in the $\phi^4$ model. This structure can be attributed to the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the modulations of amplitudes of constituent oscillons which form the excited oscillon. We also find evidence that such modulations arise as a motion of two quasi-breathers inside the constituent oscillon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbifold curves and establish the isomorphism between the space of twisted restricted conformal blocks and the space of twisted conformal blocks. In the specific example of a twisted projective line, isomorphisms between the space of $g$-twisted (restricted) conformal block and the space of $g$-twisted (restricted) correlation functions are established. This leads to a more conceptual proof of the $g$-twisted fusion rule theorem in vertex operator algebra theory. Furthermore, by introducing a geometric generalization of Zhu's algebra and its modules, we obtain a general version of the twisted fusion rule theorem.</description>

      <title>Discrete minimizers of the interaction energy in collective behavior: a brief numerical and analytic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider minimizers of the N-particle interaction potential energy and briefly review numerical methods used to calculate them. We consider simple pair potentials which are attractive at short distances and repulsive at long distances, focusing on examples which are sums of two powers. The range of powers we look at includes the well-known case of the Lennard-Jones potential, but we are also interested in less singular potentials which are relevant in collective behavior models. We report on results using the software GMIN developed by Wales and collaborators for problems in chemistry. For all cases, this algorithm gives good candidates for the minimizers for relatively low values of the particle number N. This is well-known for potentials similar to Lennard-Jones, but not for the range which is of interest in collective behavior. Standard minimization procedures have been used in the literature in this range, but they are likely to yield stationary states which are not minimizers. We illustrate numerically some properties of the minimizers in 2D, such as lattice structure, Wulff shapes, and the continuous large-N limit for locally integrable (that is, less singular) potentials.</description>

      <title>A hands-on introduction to Physics-Informed Neural Networks for solving partial differential equations with benchmark tests taken from astrophysics and plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I provide an introduction to the application of deep learning and neural networks for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach, known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), involves minimizing the residual of the equation evaluated at various points within the domain. Boundary conditions are incorporated either by introducing soft constraints with corresponding boundary data values in the minimization process or by strictly enforcing the solution with hard constraints. PINNs are tested on diverse PDEs extracted from two-dimensional physical/astrophysical problems. Specifically, we explore Grad-Shafranov-like equations that capture magnetohydrodynamic equilibria in magnetically dominated plasmas. Lane-Emden equations that model internal structure of stars in sef-gravitating hydrostatic equilibrium are also considered. The flexibility of the method to handle various boundary conditions is illustrated through various examples, as well as its ease in solving parametric and inverse problems. The corresponding Python codes based on PyTorch/TensorFlow libraries are made available.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum of the Potential of a General Two-Dimensional Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the leading order of the maximum of the random potential associated to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas for general $\beta$ and general confinement potential, extending the recent result of Lambert-Lebl\'e-Zeitouni. In the case $\beta=2$, this corresponds to the (centered) log-characteristic polynomial of either the Ginibre random matrix ensemble for $V(x)=\frac{|x|^2}{2}$ or a more general normal matrix ensemble. The result on the leading order asymptotics for the maximum of the log-characteristic polynomial is new for random normal matrices. We rely on connections with the classical obstacle problem and the theory of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos. We make use of a new concentration result for fluctuations of $C^{1,1}$ linear statistics which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Underdamped Systems: An Analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory deals with finding protocols to steer a system between assigned initial and final states, such that a trajectory-dependent cost function is minimized. The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics, to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics, leading to practical and conceptual difficulties.
  In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at minimum dissipation for stochastic underdamped dynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we prove that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation. Our results allow us to numerically study cost asymmetries in expansion and compression processes and make predictions for inertial corrections to optimal protocols in the Landauer erasure problem at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Impact of Diffusion on synchronization pattern of epidemics in nonidentical metapopulation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a prior study, a novel deterministic compartmental model known as the SEIHRK model was introduced, shedding light on the pivotal role of test kits as an intervention strategy for mitigating epidemics. Particularly in heterogeneous networks, it was empirically demonstrated that strategically distributing a limited number of test kits among nodes with higher degrees substantially diminishes the outbreak size. The network's dynamics were explored under varying values of infection rate. In this research, we expand upon these findings to investigate the influence of migration on infection dynamics within distinct communities of the network. Notably, we observe that nodes equipped with test kits and those without tend to segregate into two separate clusters when coupling strength is low, but beyond a critical threshold coupling coefficient, they coalesce into a unified cluster. Building on this clustering phenomenon, we develop a reduced equation model and rigorously validate its accuracy through comprehensive simulations. We show that this property is observed in both complete and random graphs.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and local solution to the non-stationary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider and generalize a model, recently proposed and analytically investigated in its quasi-stationary approximation by the authors, for visco-elasticity with large deformations and conditional compatibility, where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors. The model takes the form of a system of integro-differential coupled equations. Here, its derivation is generalized to consider mixed boundary conditions, which may represent a wider range of physical applications then the case with Dirichlet boundary conditions considered in our previous contribution. This also introduces nontrivial technical difficulties in the theoretical framework, related to the definition and the regularity of the solutions of elliptic operators with mixed boundary conditions. As a novel contribution, we develop the analysis of the fully non-stationary version of the system where we consider inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a local in time weak solution in three space dimensions, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis.</description>

      <title>Postquantum Br\`{e}gman relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.01837v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to construction of Br\`{e}gman relative entropies over nonreflexive Banach spaces, based on nonlinear mappings into reflexive Banach spaces. We apply it to derive few families of Br\`{e}gman relative entropies over several radially compact base normed spaces in spectral duality. In particular, we prove generalised pythagorean theorem and norm-to-norm continuity of the corresponding entropic projections for a family induced on preduals of any W$^*$-algebras and of semifinite JBW-algebras using Mazur maps into corresponding noncommutative and nonassociative $L_p$ spaces. We also prove generalised pythagorean theorem for a family induced using Kaczmarz maps into Orlicz spaces over semifinite W$^*$-algebras, and for a family over generalised spin factors. Additionally, we establish Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of the nonassociative Mazur map on positive parts of unit balls, characterise several geometric properties of the Morse-Transue-Nakano-Luxemburg norm on noncommutative Orlicz spaces, and introduce a new family of $L_p$ spaces over order unit spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalised Br\`{e}gman relative entropies: a brief introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present some basic elements of the theory of generalised Br\`{e}gman relative entropies over nonreflexive Banach spaces. Using nonlinear embeddings of Banach spaces together with the Euler--Legendre functions, this approach unifies two former approaches to Br\`{e}gman relative entropy: one based on reflexive Banach spaces, another based on differential geometry. This construction allows to extend Br\`{e}gman relative entropies, and related geometric and operator structures, to arbitrary-dimensional state spaces of probability, quantum, and postquantum theory. We give several examples, not considered previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for toric code and X-cube fracton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic and efficient quantum circuit composed solely of Clifford gates for simulating the ground state of the surface code model. This approach yields the ground state of the toric code in $\lceil 2L+2+log_{2}(d)+\frac{L}{2d} \rceil$ time steps, where $L$ refers to the system size and $d$ represents the maximum distance to constrain the application of the CNOT gates. Our algorithm reformulates the problem into a purely geometric one, facilitating its extension to attain the ground state of certain 3D topological phases, such as the 3D toric model in $3L+8$ steps and the X-cube fracton model in $12L+11$ steps. Furthermore, we introduce a gluing method involving measurements, enabling our technique to attain the ground state of the 2D toric code on an arbitrary planar lattice and paving the way to more intricate 3D topological phases.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Central Limit Theorem for non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the mesoscopic linear statistics $\sum_i f(n^a(\sigma_i-z_0))$ of the eigenvalues $\{\sigma_i\}_i$ of large $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with complex centred i.i.d. entries are asymptotically Gaussian for any $H^{2}_0$-functions $f$ around any point $z_0$ in the bulk of the spectrum on any mesoscopic scale $0&lt;a&lt;1/2$. This extends our previous result [arXiv:1912.04100], that was valid on the macroscopic scale, $a=0$, to cover the entire mesoscopic regime. The main novelty is a local law for the product of resolvents for the Hermitization of $X$ at spectral parameters $z_1, z_2$ with an improved error term in the entire mesoscopic regime $|z_1-z_2|\gg n^{-1/2}$. The proof is dynamical; it relies on a recursive tandem of the characteristic flow method and the Green function comparison idea combined with a separation of the unstable mode of the underlying stability operator.</description>

      <title>Mirror Map for Landau-Ginzburg models with nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02782v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BHK mirror symmetry as introduced by Berglund--H\"ubsch and Marc Krawitz between Landau--Ginzburg (LG) models has been the topic of much study in recent years. An LG model is determined by a potential function and a group of symmetries. BHK mirror symmetry is only valid when the group of symmetries is comprised of the so-called diagonal symmetries. Recently, an extension to BHK mirror symmetry to include nonabelian symmetry groups has been conjectured. In this article, we provide a mirror map at the level of state spaces between the LG A-model state space and the LG B-model state space for the mirror model predicted by the BHK mirror symmetry extension for nonabelian LG models. We introduce two technical conditions, the Diagonal Scaling Condition, and the Equivariant $\Phi$ condition, under which a bi-degree preserving isomorphism of state spaces (the mirror map) is guaranteed to exist, and we prove that the condition is always satisfied if the permutation part of the group is cyclic of prime order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that nonlinear electrodynamics of the Born--Infeld theory type may be exploited to shed insight into a few fundamental problems in theoretical physics, including rendering electromagnetic asymmetry to energetically exclude magnetic monopoles, achieving finite electromagnetic energy to relegate curvature singularities of charged black holes, and providing theoretical interpretation of equations of state of cosmic fluids via k-essence cosmology. Also discussed are some nonlinear differential equation problems.</description>

      <title>Equality in some symplectic eigenvalue inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, numerous works have investigated several properties of symplectic eigenvalues. Remarkably, the results on symplectic eigenvalues have been found to be analogous to those of eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices with appropriate interpretations. In particular, symplectic analogs of famous eigenvalue inequalities are known today such as Weyl's inequalities, Lidskii's inequalities, and Schur--Horn majorization inequalities. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for equality in the symplectic analogs of the aforementioned inequalities. The equality conditions for the symplectic Weyl's and Lidskii's inequalities turn out to be analogous to the known equality conditions for eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomita-Takesaki theory associates a positive operator called the "modular operator" with a von Neumann algebra and a cyclic-separating vector. Tomita's theorem says that the unitary flow generated by the modular operator leaves the algebra invariant. I give a new, short proof of this theorem which only uses the analytic structure of unitary flows, and which avoids operator-valued Fourier transforms (as in van Daele's proof) and operator-valued Mellin transforms (as in Zsid\'{o}'s and Woronowicz's proofs). The proof is similar to one given by Bratteli and Robinson in the special case that the modular operator is bounded.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the $1+1+2$ covariant formalism in the presence of nonmetricity. Focusing on static and Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes, we show how nonmetricity affects all the kinematic quantities involved in the covariant $1+1+2$ decomposition. We apply the resulting geometrical framework to study spherically symmetric solutions in the context of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity in vacuum. We obtain explicit solutions and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schwarzschild-de Sitter type solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a weighted positive mass theorem which unifies and generalizes results of Baldauf--Ozuch and Chu--Zhu. Our result is in fact equivalent to the usual positive mass theorem, and can be regarded as a positive mass theorem for smooth metric measure spaces. We also study Dirac operators on certain warped product manifolds associated to smooth metric measure spaces. Applications of this include, among others, an alternative proof for a special case of our positive mass theorem, eigenvalue bounds for the Dirac operator on closed spin manifolds, and a new way to understand the weighted Dirac operator using warped products.</description>

Abstract: We propose a binary nonadditive Asakura-Oosawa-like mixture as an example for the classical limit of a Luttinger liquid.

We then propose a new class of one dimensional classical fluids.</description>
