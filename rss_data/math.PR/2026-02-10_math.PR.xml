      <title>Limiting Behavior of Randomly Perturbed Diffusions with Invariant Repelling Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study small perturbations of diffusion processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that leave invariant a finite collection of hypersurfaces. Each surface is assumed to be repelling for the unperturbed process, and the unperturbed motion on each of the surfaces is assumed to be ergodic. These surfaces separate the space into a finite number of domains, each of which carries an invariant measure of the unperturbed process. We describe the asymptotics of the densities of the invariant measures near the invariant surfaces. We then describe the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed process: at different time scales (depending on the size of the perturbation), metastable distributions are described in terms of linear combinations of the ergodic invariant measures of the unperturbed system. The coefficients in the linear combination depend on the time scale but are shown not to depend on the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Intermittency of geometric Brownian motion on $ \textbf{SL}(n) $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note is motivated by a recently discovered connection between a drift-diffusion process in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space with a divergence-free drift sampled from a stationary and isotropic Gaussian ensemble of critical scaling on the one hand, and a geometric Brownian motion on $\textbf{SL}(n)$ on the other hand. This can be seen as a tensorial form of a stochastic exponential; it thus is naturally intermittent, which transfers to the pair distance of the drift-diffusion process.
  In this note, we quantify the intermittency of the geometric Brownian motion $\{F_\tau\}_{\tau\ge0}$ on $\textbf{SL}(n)$ also in dimensions $n&gt;2$. We do so in two (related) ways: 1) by identifying the exponential growth rate for the $2p$-th stochastic moment $\mathbb{E}|F_\tau|^{2p}$ with its anomalous dependence on $p$ (and $n$), and 2) by quantifying a non-tightness of $|F_\tau|^2/\mathbb{E}|F_\tau|^2$ as $\tau\uparrow\infty$. It is the second property that transmits to the drift-diffusion process.
  The arguments rely on stochastic analysis: We write $\{F_\tau\}_{\tau\geq 0}$ as the solution of $dF=F_\tau\circ dB$ with $\{B_\tau\}_{\tau\geq 0}$ a Brownian motion on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$. The arguments leverage isotropy: The diffusion projects onto the spectrum of the Gram matrix $G=F^*F$, as captured by ${\rm tr}G^p$.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent McKean PDEs with reaction: a discussion on probabilistic interpretations and particle approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss and compare two probabilistic approaches for associating a stochastic differential equation with a McKean-type partial differential equation featuring a reaction term and path-dependent coefficients. The non-conservative nature of the macroscopic dynamics leads to two possible interpretations of the sub-probability measure and of the associated SDE equation at the microscale: on the one hand, as a measure-valued solution of a Feynman-Kac-type equation; on the other hand, as the sub-probability associated with an SDE defined up to a survival time with a reaction-dependent rate. These different interpretations give rise to two different microscopic stochastic models and therefore to two different techniques of probabilistic analysis. Finally, by considering the interacting particle systems associated with both models, we discuss how their empirical densities provide two different kernel estimators for the PDE solution.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic model of X-ray computed tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete stochastic process, indexed by lines through the unit disk in the plane, which models the observed photon counts in a medical X-ray tomography scan. We first prove a functional law of large numbers, showing that this process converges in $L^2$ to the X-ray transform of the underlying attenuation function. We then prove a family of functional central limit theorems, which show that the normalized observations converge to a white noise on the space of lines, provided the growth rate of the mean number of photons per line is greater than a certain power of the number of lines scanned. Using this family of theorems, we can reduce that power arbitrarily close to zero by adding correction terms to the normalization. We also prove a Berry-Esseen inequality that gives a concrete rate of convergence for each functional central limit theorem in our family of theorems.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on the fluctuation of the structure of random walk ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuation phenomena for the graph distance and the number of cut points associated with random media arising from the range of a random walk. Our results demonstrate a sequence of dimension-dependent phase transitions in the scaling behavior of these fluctuations, leading to qualitatively different regimes across dimensions lower than six, equal to six, and higher than six. In particular, in six dimensions, we show that the convergence to the normal distribution occurs under a scaling different from that of the standard central limit theorem. We also give the related results for the effective resistance of the random walk range.</description>

      <title>On Time-Changed Birth-Death Processes with Catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two time-changed variants of the birth-death process with catastrophe where the time-changing components are the first hitting times of the stable subordinator and the tempered stable subordinator. For both the processes, we derive the governing system of fractional differential equations for their state probabilities. The Laplace transforms of these state probabilities are obtained in terms of those of the corresponding time-changed birth-death processes without catastrophes. We obtain the distribution of catastrophe occurrence times as well as the sojourn times within non-zero states. We study distributional properties of the first visit time to state zero in a particular case. Also, the first occurrence time of an effective catastrophe is studied. Moreover, we study the time-changed linear birth-death processes with catastrophes, derive the explicit expressions for its state probabilities, expectation and variance. For a specific case, we compare the expectation plots across different parameter values and provide an algorithm for simulating sample paths with illustrative plots.</description>

      <title>Largest gaps between bulk eigenvalues of unitary-invariant random Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $n\times n$ random Hermitian matrix ensembles that are invariant under unitary conjugation. Let $I$ be a finite union of intervals lying in the bulk, and let $m_{k}^{(n)}$ be the $k$-th largest gap between consecutive eigenvalues lying in $I$. We prove that the rescaled gap $\smash{\tau_{k}^{(n)}}$, which is defined by \begin{align*} m_{k}^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi \inf_{I}\rho} \bigg( \frac{\sqrt{32 \log n}}{n} + \frac{3q-8}{2q} \frac{ \log(2\log n)}{n \sqrt{2\log n}} + \frac{4\tau_{k}^{(n)}}{n \sqrt{2\log n}} \bigg), \end{align*} converges in distribution as $n\to +\infty$ to a gamma-Gumbel random variable that is shifted by an explicit constant $c_{V,I}$ depending only on $I$ and on the potential $V$. Here $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure and $q\in \N_{&gt;0}$ is the highest order at which $\rho(x)$ approaches $\inf_{I}\rho$ with $x\in I$; for example, if $\rho(x)=1/(\pi\sqrt{x(1-x)})$, then $q=2$ if $\frac{1}{2}\in \overline{I}$ and $q=1$ otherwise. This work extends a result of Feng and Wei beyond the Gaussian potential.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos for Nonlinear Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 1-Wasserstein propagation of chaos for "McKean-type" nonlinear Markov chains and their associated interacting particle systems. This paper is organized into two parts: the first part combines arguments from various areas of nonlinear Markov theory into a systematic treatment of quantitative, nonasymptotic empirical measure estimates and propagation of chaos, with Lipschitz regularity as the primary tool. We also study extensions to uniform-in-time propagation of chaos and improved convergence rates under stronger assumptions such as transportation inequalities, modified metrics, or geometric ergodicity. The second part of this work consists of two detailed applications of our results to specific systems of interest: an Euler-Maruyama scheme for the standard McKean-Vlasov diffusion, and particle filtering via Feynman-Kac distribution flows.</description>

      <title>Random walks with drift in the positive quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two dimensional random walks conditioned to stay in the positive quadrant. Assuming that the increments of the walk have finite second moments and that the drift vector is co-oriented with one of two axes, we construct positive harmonic functions for such walks and find tail asymptotics for the exit time from the positive quadrant. Moreover, we prove integral and local limit theorems. Finally, we apply our local limit theorems to singular lattice walks with steps $\{(1,-1),(1,1),(-1,1)\}$ and determine asymptotics for the number of walks of length $n$ which end on the line $\{(k,1),\ k\ge1\}$.</description>

      <title>Moment generating functions in combinatorial optimization: Bipartite matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a random model of minimum cost bipartite matching based on exponentially distributed edge costs, we show that the distribution of the cost of the optimal solution can be computed efficiently. The distribution is represented by its moment generating function, which in this model is always a rational function. The complex zeros of this function are of interest as the lack of zeros near the origin indicates a certain regularity of the distribution. We propose a conjecture according to which these moment generating functions never have complex zeros of smaller modulus than their first pole. For minimum cost perfect matching, also known as the assignment problem, such a zero-free disk would imply a Gaussian scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Rate of divergence of time constant for frog model with vanishing initial density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frog model with a Bernoulli initial configuration is an interacting particle system on the $d$-dimensional lattice ($d \geq 2$) with two types of particles: active and sleeping. Active particles perform independent simple random walks. In contrast, although the sleeping particles do not move at first, they become active and start moving once touched by the active particles. Initially, only the origin has a single active particle, and the other sites have sleeping particles according to a Bernoulli distribution. After the original active particle starts moving, further active particles are gradually generated under the above rule and propagate across the lattice. The time required for the propagation of active frogs is expected to increase as the parameter of the Bernoulli distribution decreases, since fewer frogs are available. The aim of this paper is to investigate this increase in the vanishing density limit. In particular, we observe that it diverges and the rate of divergence differs significantly between $d=2$ and $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Green--Wasserstein Inequality on Compact Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact connected two-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary. In this note, we answer a question posed by Steinerberger: can one remove the $\sqrt{\log n}$ factor in the two-dimensional Green--Wasserstein inequality while keeping the unrenormalized off-diagonal Green term? We show that this is impossible on any compact connected surface: there is no inequality of the same form that holds uniformly over point sets with an $O(n^{-1/2})$ remainder for all $n$. We argue by contradiction and combine a second-moment estimate for the random Green energy of i.i.d. samples with the semi-discrete random matching asymptotics of Ambrosio--Glaudo.</description>

      <title>On the position matrix of single-shelf shuffle and card guessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical shufflers used in many casinos employ a card shuffling scheme called \emph{shelf shuffling}. In a single-shelf shuffling, cards arrive sequentially, and each incoming card is independently placed on the top or the bottom of a shelf with equal probability. The position matrix of a single-shelf shuffling encodes the probability that the $i$-th incoming card is in position $j$ after one round of single-shelf shuffle. The spectral properties of the position matrix of card shuffling schemes are helpful in the analysis of card guessing games without feedback. In this paper, we determine the full spectrum and the corresponding eigenspaces of the position matrix $M$ of a single-shelf shuffle. This strengthens and resolves two conjectures in a recent work [arXiv:2507.10294]. As a consequence of these results, we show that the maximum number of expected correct guesses without feedback after $k\geq (1+\epsilon)$ many shuffles is of the order $1+O(n^{-2\epsilon})$. On the other hand, the expected number of correct guesses after one shuffle is at most $\sqrt{2n/\pi}+1+O(n^{-1/2})$, and we give a strategy (not optimal) that achieves $\sqrt{2n/\pi}-1$ number of correct cards in expectation.</description>

      <title>First-Exit Time Analysis for Truncated Heavy-Tailed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the first-exit time of stochastic difference equation $X^\eta_{j+1}(x) = X^\eta_{j}(x) + \eta a\big( X^\eta_{j}(x)\big) + \eta \sigma\big( X^\eta_{j}(x)\big)Z_{j+1}$ and its truncated variant $X^{\eta|b}_{j+1}(x) = X^{\eta|b}_{j}( x) + \varphi_b\big(\eta a\big( X^{\eta|b}_{j}( x)\big) + \eta \sigma\big( X^{\eta|b}_{j}( x)\big) Z_{j+1}\big)$, where $\varphi_b(x) = (x/|x|)\min\{|x|, b\}$ and the law of the noise $Z_t$ is multivariate regularly varying. The truncation operator $\varphi_b(\cdot)$ is often introduced as a modulation mechanism in heavy-tailed systems, such as stochastic gradient descent algorithms in deep learning. By developing a framework that connects large deviations with metastability, we leverage the locally uniform sample-path large deviations for both processes in Wang and Rhee (2024) to obtain precise characterizations of the joint distributions of the first exit times and exit locations. The resulting limit theorem unveils a discrete hierarchy of phase transitions (i.e., exit times) as the truncation threshold $b$ varies, and manifests the catastrophe principle, whereby key events or metastable behaviors in heavy-tailed systems are driven by catastrophic behavior in a few components while the rest of the system behaves nominally. These developments lead to a comprehensive heavy-tailed counterpart of the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory.</description>

      <title>On tail behavior of infinite sums of independent indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y=\sum_{k\ge 1} 1_{A_k}$ be an infinite sum of the indicators of independent events. We investigate a precise (as opposed to logarithmic) first-order asymptotic behavior of the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}\{Y\ge n\}$ and the point probabilities $\mathbb{P}\{Y=n\}$ as $n\to\infty$. Our analysis provides a reasonably complete classification of the asymptotic behaviors covering most cases of practical interest. These general results are then applied to specific examples where the success probabilities $r_k:=\mathbb{P}(A_k)$ decay polynomially $r_k\sim ck^{-\beta}$ or (sub-, super-) exponentially $r_k\sim ce^{-k^\beta}$, yielding the asymptotic tail and point probabilities in explicit forms.
  As briefly discussed in the paper, infinite sums of independent indicators arise naturally in numerous settings as diverse as the range of Poissonized samples, the infinite Ginibre point processes and decoupled renewal processes, and records in the $F^\alpha$ scheme. We also explore the connection of our research to the theory of Hayman-admissible functions and the notion of total positivity.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger bridge with transport relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by modern machine learning applications where we only have access to empirical measures constructed from finite samples, we relax the marginal constraints of the classical Schr\"odinger bridge problem by penalizing the transport cost between the bridge's marginals and the prescribed marginals. We derive a duality formula for this transport-relaxed bridge and demonstrate that it reduces to a finite-dimensional concave optimization problem when the prescribed marginals are discrete and the reference distribution is absolutely continuous. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both the primal and dual problems. Moreover, as the penalty blows up, we characterize the limiting bridge as the solution to a discrete Schr\"odinger bridge problem and identify a leading-order logarithmic divergence. Finally, we propose gradient ascent and Sinkhorn-type algorithms to numerically solve the transport-relaxed Schr\"odinger bridge, establishing a linear convergence rate for both algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We show how the parabolic version of the Adams theorem and its corollary can be used to estimate in $L_{p}$ the evolution family associated to a divergence form second-order parabolic operator with parabolic Morrey lower-order terms and also how to estimate the moments of the derivatives of solutions of It\^o equations with respect to the initial data when the drift term has singularities.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Conditional Mutual Independence: Equivalence and Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional independence, and more generally conditional mutual independence, are central notions in probability theory. In their general forms, they include functional dependence as a special case. In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems related to conditional mutual independence. Let $K$ and $K'$ be two conditional mutual independncies (CMIs) defined on a finite set of discrete random variables. We have obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for i) $K$ is equivalent to $K'$; ii) $K$ implies $K'$. These characterizations are in terms of a canonical form introduced for conditional mutual independence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singular $\Phi^4_2$ equation at a pitchfork bifurcation of the underlying deterministic dynamics. To this aim, we linearize the SPDE along its stationary solution and show that the support of its finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is the real line, regardless of the bifurcation parameter and in sharp contrast to the non-singular $\Phi^4_1$ equation. The proof relies on a support theorem for the stationary solution and its renormalized square.</description>

      <title>Random Polyhedral Cones: Distributional Results via Gale Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ be independent random vectors uniformly distributed on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^{d-1}\subseteq\mathbb R^d$, where $n\ge d$, and consider the random polyhedral cone \[ \mathcal W_{n,d}:=\mathop{\mathrm{pos}} (U_1,\ldots,U_n) = \{\lambda_1 U_1+ \ldots + \lambda_n U_n: \lambda_1\geq 0, \ldots, \lambda_n \geq 0\}. \] We establish several distributional results for $\mathcal W_{n,d}$ and the associated spherical polytope $\mathcal W_{n,d}\cap\mathbb S^{d-1}$. Our main contributions include:
  (i) Let $\alpha_d$ denote the solid angle of $\mathcal W_{d,d}$ and write $m(d,k):=\mathbb E[\alpha_d^k]$ for its $k$-th moment. We prove the symmetry $m(d,k)=m(k,d)$. As an application, we compute $\mathop{\mathrm{Var}}[\alpha_d]=2^{-d}(d+1)^{-1}-4^{-d}$ and derive a closed formula for the third moment.
  (ii) For $n=d+1,d+2,d+3$ we determine the probability that $\mathcal W_{n,d}\cap\mathbb S^{d-1}$ is a spherical simplex, a spherical analogue of the classical Sylvester problem. In the case $n=d+2$ we also determine the distribution of the number of vertices of $\mathcal W_{d+2,d}\cap\mathbb S^{d-1}$.
  (iii) Let $f_\ell(\mathcal W_{n,d})$ denote the number of $\ell$-dimensional faces of $\mathcal W_{n,d}$. We prove a distributional limit theorem for $f_\ell(\mathcal W_{n,d})$ in the regime $n=d+k$ and $\ell=d-q$, where $k,q\in\mathbb N$ are fixed and $d\to\infty$. The limit law is a weighted sum of independent chi squared variables, with weights given by explicit eigenvalues of a convolution operator on the sphere.
  A unifying ingredient is an explicit coupling producing i.i.d. uniform vectors $U_1,\ldots,U_n\in\mathbb S^{d-1}$ together with i.i.d. uniform vectors $V_1,\ldots,V_n\in\mathbb S^{n-d-1}$ whose associated oriented matroids are Gale dual.</description>

      <title>The Yang--Mills measure on compact surfaces as a universal scaling limit of lattice gauge models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the 2 dimensional Yang-Mills measure on compact surfaces from a unified continuum and discrete perspective. We construct the Yang-Mills measure as a random distributional 1-form on surfaces of arbitrary genus equipped with an arbitrary smooth area form, using geometric tools based on zero-area bands and cylindrical resolutions. This yields a canonical bulk-singular decomposition of the measure, reflecting the topology of the surface.
  We prove a universality theorem stating that the continuum Yang-Mills measure arises as the scaling limit of a wide class of lattice gauge theories, including Wilson, Manton, and Villain actions, on any compact surface. We study the convergence in natural spaces of distributions with anisotropic regularity. As further consequences, we obtain a new intrinsic construction of the Yang-Mills measure, independent of the previous constructions in the literature, and prove the convergence of correlation functions and Segal amplitudes on all compact surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a slow-fast system of coupled two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in which the fast component is perturbed by an additive fractional Brownian noise with Hurst parameter $H&gt;\frac{1}{3}$. The system is analyzed using rough path theory, and the limiting behaviour strongly depends on the value of $H$. We prove convergence in law of the slow component to a Navier-Stokes system with an additional It\^o-Stokes drift when $H&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. In contrast, for $H\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$, the limit equation features only a transport noise driven by a rough path.</description>

      <title>How far from the edge need a population be to survive? A probability model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a natural number. We consider a population which lives on $I_N=\{-N,-N+1,\dots,N-1,N\}$. Each individual gives birth at rate $\lambda$ on each of its neighboring sites and dies at rate 1. No births are allowed from the inside of $I_N$ to the outside or vice-versa.
  The population on the whole line (i.e. $N=+\infty$) survives with positive probability if and only if $\lambda&gt;1/2$. On the other hand for any $1/2&lt; \lambda\leq \sqrt 2/2$ there exists a natural number $N_c$ such that the population survives on $I_N$ for $N\geq N_c$ but dies out for $N&lt;N_c$. There is no limit on the number of individuals per site so the population could grow at the center where the birth rates are maximum. Our result shows that it does not if the edge is too close.</description>

      <title>Almost sure null bankruptcy of testing-by-betting strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bounded mean betting procedure serves as a crucial interface between the domains of (1) sequential, anytime-valid statistical inference, and (2) online learning and portfolio selection algorithms. While recent work in both domains has established the exponential wealth growth of numerous betting strategies under any alternative distribution, the tightness of the inverted confidence sets, and the pathwise minimax regret bounds, little has been studied regarding the asymptotics of these strategies under the null hypothesis. Under the null, a strategy induces a wealth martingale converging to some random variable that can be zero (bankrupt) or non-zero (non-bankrupt, e.g. when it eventually stops betting). In this paper, we show the conceptually intuitive but technically nontrivial fact that these strategies (universal portfolio, Krichevsky-Trofimov, GRAPA, hedging, etc.) all go bankrupt with probability one, under any non-degenerate null distribution. Part of our analysis is based on the subtle almost sure divergence of various sums of $\sum O_p(n^{-1})$ type, a result of independent interest. We also demonstrate the necessity of null bankruptcy by showing that non-bankrupt strategies are all improvable in some sense. Our results significantly deepen our understanding of these betting strategies as they qualify their behavior on "almost all paths", whereas previous results are usually on "all paths" (e.g. regret bounds) or "most paths" (e.g. concentration inequalities and confidence sets).</description>

      <title>Bandit Allocational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms allocate pulls among competing arms, the resulting allocation can exhibit huge variation. This is particularly harmful in modern applications such as learning-enhanced platform operations and post-bandit statistical inference. Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \cdot S_T=\Omega(T^{\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\rightarrow\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $\Theta(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= \omega(\sqrt{T})$. We further show that this lower bound is essentially tight, and that any point on the Pareto frontier $R_T \cdot S_T=\tilde{\Theta}(T^{3/2})$ can be achieved by a simple tunable algorithm UCB-f, a generalization of the classic UCB1. Finally, we discuss implications for platform operations and for statistical inference, when bandit algorithms are used. As a byproduct of our result, we resolve an open question of Praharaj and Khamaru (2025).</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Priors for Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many inverse problems arising in engineering and applied sciences involve unknown quantities with pronounced spatial inhomogeneity, such as localized defects or spatially varying material properties, making reliable uncertainty quantification particularly challenging. While Bayesian inverse problem methodologies provide a principled framework for assessing reconstruction reliability, commonly used Gaussian priors, such as Whittle-Matern models, impose globally homogeneous assumptions that limit their ability to capture such structure in large-scale settings. We introduce a new class of inhomogeneous priors defined via convolution with white noise, yielding nonstationary Whittle-Matern-type random fields with a rigorous mathematical construction. These priors fit naturally within existing Bayesian well-posedness theory and enable efficient sampling by reducing prior realizations to the solution of a pseudo-differential equation, for which we develop numerical schemes with quantified approximation error. Numerical experiments in one-dimensional denoising and two-dimensional limited-angle X-ray tomography demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and uncertainty quantification, particularly in data-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Capacity Scaling Laws for Boundary-Induced Drift-Diffusion Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the high-power capacity scaling of additive noise channels whose noise arises from the first-hitting location of a multidimensional drift-diffusion process on an absorbing hyperplane. By identifying the underlying stochastic transport mechanism as a Gaussian variance-mixture, we introduce and analyze the Normally-Drifted First-Hitting Location (NDFHL) family as a geometry-driven model for boundary-induced noise. Under a second-moment constraint, we derive an exact high-SNR capacity expansion and show that the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide at the constant level, yielding a vanishing capacity gap. As a consequence, isotropic Gaussian signaling is asymptotically capacity-achieving for all fixed drift strengths, despite the non-Gaussian and semi-heavy-tailed nature of the noise. The pre-log factor is determined solely by the dimension of the receiving boundary, revealing a geometric origin of the channel's degrees of freedom. The refined expansion further uncovers an entropy-dominant universality, whereby all physical parameters of the transport process -- including drift strength, diffusion coefficient, and boundary separation -- affect the capacity only through the differential entropy of the induced noise. Although the NDFHL density does not admit a simple closed form, its entropy is shown to be finite and to vary continuously as the drift vanishes, thereby connecting the finite-variance regime with the singular infinite-variance Cauchy limit. Together, these results provide a unified geometric and information-theoretic characterization of boundary-hitting channels across both regular and singular transport regimes.</description>

      <title>Geometric ergodicity of Gibbs samplers for linear latent models with GIG variance mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study geometric ergodicity of the Gibbs sampler for linear latent non-Gaussian models (LLnGMs), a class of hierarchical models in which conditional Gaussian structure is preserved through generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) variance-mixture augmentation. Two complementary routes to geometric ergodicity are developed for the marginal chain on the mixing variables. First, we show that the associated Markov operator is trace-class, and hence admits a spectral gap, over a large portion of the GIG parameter space. Second, for the remaining boundary and heavy-tail regimes, we establish geometric ergodicity via drift and minorization, subject to an explicit null-smallness condition that quantifies how the drift interacts with the null space of the observation operator. Together, these results cover the full GIG parameter space, including the normal-inverse Gaussian, generalized asymmetric Laplace, and Student-$t$ special cases. The geometric ergodicity of this chain underpins the consistency of Gibbs-based stochastic-gradient estimators for maximum likelihood estimation, and we provide conditions that make the required integrability checks transparent. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings, contrasting mixing efficiency across parameter regimes and probing the role of the null-smallness constant.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian Conjugate Rogers-Shephard Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fuse between the Rogers-Shephard inequality for the Lebesgue measure and Royen's Gaussian Correlation Inequality, simultaneously extending both into a single sharp inequality for the Gaussian measure $\gamma$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, stating that \[ \gamma(K) \gamma(L) \leq \gamma(K\cap L) \gamma(K+L) \] whenever $K$ and $L$ are origin-symmetric convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This confirms a conjecture of M. Tehranchi [https://doi.org/10.1214/17-ECP89]. In fact, we show that the inequality remains valid whenever the Gaussian barycenters of $K$ and $L$ are at the origin, and characterize the equality cases. After rescaling, this also yields the following new inequality for convex sets with (Lebesgue) barycenters at the origin: \[ |K| |L| \leq |K \cap L| |K + L | ; \] this can be seen as a conjugate counterpart to Spingarn's extension of the Rogers-Shephard inequality (where $K+L$ is replaced by $K-L$ above). We also derive an additional conjugate version of a Gaussian inequality due to V. Milman and Pajor, as well as several extensions. Our main tool is a new Gaussian Forward-Reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality for centered log-concave functions, of independent interest, which is crucially applicable to degenerate Gaussian covariances.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version that admits an exact recursion for the distribution of left--right crossings, and prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) for all length scales if $d\ge3$. A Gaussian approximation, supported by numerics, predicts that, in the marginal case $d=2$, this scaling acquires a logarithmic correction and that the variance-to-mean ratio of conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ (the ``$2/3$ law'') for all $d\ge2$. We conjecture that both effects persist beyond the hierarchical setting. We finally provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and interpret it as a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching.

      <title>Operatopes, Operanoids, and Noncommutative Zonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of convex bodies called operatopes that are obtained by taking Minkowski sums of affine images of an operator norm ball. This notion generalizes that of zonotopes which are Minkowksi sums of line segments. Taking the limit of the number of line segments to infinity yields the class of convex bodies called zonoids, which can also be viewed as the expectation of a random line segment. Expanding on this interpretation, we analogously define operanoids as the expectation of a random affine image of an operator norm ball. In studying the properties of operanoids when the dimension of the operator norm ball grows, we arrive at a new asymptotic regime for limits of convex bodies. This leads to the more general class of convex bodies called noncommutative zonoids, and we use the framework of free probability theory to illustrate basic properties and examples. Finally, we discuss applications of operanoids and noncommutative zonoids in statistics and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents for Sparsely Coupled Linear Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies structured products of real matrices for which the top Lyapunov exponent can be accessed by reducing the dynamics to an amenable generalization of upper triangular matrices. Exploiting prescribed zero patterns (including block-triangularity and sparse decompositions, conveniently encoded by a directed sparsity graph), we obtain explicit, computable bounds and, in favorable cases, formulas for $\gamma_1$ by combining deterministic triangular controls with a suitable refinement of the Furstenberg--Kifer lemma for block-triangular products. The estimates apply both to tempered (possibly deterministic) sequences and to stationary ergodic random cocycles under standard integrability. We also discuss applications to perturbation models for linear systems, including low-rank updates, where the reduction converts the problem to lower-dimensional or scalar cocycles.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Community Detection in Contextual Multi-Layer Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of community detection from the joint observation of a high-dimensional covariate matrix and $L$ sparse networks, all encoding noisy, partial information about the latent community labels of $n$ subjects. In the asymptotic regime where the networks have constant average degree and the number of features $p$ grows proportionally with $n$, we derive a sharp threshold under which detecting and estimating the subject labels is possible. Our results extend the work of \cite{MN23} to the constant-degree regime with noisy measurements, and also resolve a conjecture in \cite{YLS24+} when the number of networks is a constant.
  Our information-theoretic lower bound is obtained via a novel comparison inequality between Bernoulli and Gaussian moments, as well as a statistical variant of the ``recovery to chi-square divergence reduction'' argument inspired by \cite{DHSS25}. On the algorithmic side, we design efficient algorithms based on counting decorated cycles and decorated paths and prove that they achieve the sharp threshold for both detection and weak recovery. In particular, our results show that there is no statistical-computational gap in this setting.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger bridge problem via empirical risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Schr\"odinger bridge problem when the endpoint distributions are available only through samples. Classical computational approaches estimate Schr\"odinger potentials via Sinkhorn iterations on empirical measures and then construct a time-inhomogeneous drift by differentiating a kernel-smoothed dual solution. In contrast, we propose a learning-theoretic route: we rewrite the Schr\"odinger system in terms of a single positive transformed potential that satisfies a nonlinear fixed-point equation and estimate this potential by empirical risk minimization over a function class. We establish uniform concentration of the empirical risk around its population counterpart under sub-Gaussian assumptions on the reference kernel and terminal density. We plug the learned potential into a stochastic control representation of the bridge to generate samples. We illustrate performance of the suggested approach with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact Stationary State of a $d$-dimensional Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Harmonic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the exact nonequilibrium steady state of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in $d$ dimensions confined in an isotropic harmonic trap $V(\mathbf r)=\mu r^{2}/2$, with $r=\|\mathbf r\|$. Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/\mu$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D&gt;0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \to 0$ and $D \to \infty$ respectively. All analytical predictions are systematically validated against numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Uphill transport in competitive drift-diffusion models with volume exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses uphill transport (defined as a regime in which particle flow is opposite to the prescriptions of Fick's diffusion) in drift-diffusion particle transport constrained by volume exclusion. Firstly, we show that the stationary hydrodynamic limit of a multispecies, weakly asymmetric exclusion process (SHDL) naturally predicts precisely characterized uphill regimes in the space of external drivings.
  Then, with specific reference to systems of oppositely charged particles, we identify well-defined model hypotheses and extensions whereby the SHDL converges to the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, thus bridging the gap between exclusion-based particle models and continuum descriptions commonly used in engineering. The merits and limitations of the models in describing the particle fluxes and predicting uphill transport conditions are investigated in detail with respect to the adopted approximations and simplifications.
  The results demonstrate the persistence of uphill transport phenomena across modeling scales, clarify the conditions under which they occur, and suggest that uphill transport may play a significant role in nanoscale electrolytes, confined ionic and iontronic devices, and membrane-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Constructive conditional normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in conditional sampling, given a probability measure $\mu$ and a diffeomorphism $\phi$, we consider the problem of simultaneously approximating $\phi$ and the pushforward $\phi_{\#}\mu$ by means of the flow of a continuity equation whose velocity field is a perceptron neural network with piecewise constant weights. We provide an explicit construction based on a polar-like decomposition of the Lagrange interpolant of $\phi$. The latter involves a compressible component, given by the gradient of a particular convex function, which can be realized exactly, and an incompressible component, which -- after approximating via permutations -- can be implemented through shear flows intrinsic to the continuity equation. For more regular maps $\phi$ -- such as the Kn\"othe-Rosenblatt rearrangement -- we provide an alternative, probabilistic construction inspired by the Maurey empirical method, in which the number of discontinuities in the weights doesn't scale inversely with the ambient dimension.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>

      <title>On the Trail of Lost Pennies: player-funded tug-of-war on the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random-turn resource-allocation games. In the Trail of Lost Pennies, a counter moves on $\mathbb{Z}$. At each turn, Maxine stakes $a \in [0,\infty)$ and Mina $b \in [0,\infty)$. The counter $X$ then moves adjacently, to the right with probability $\tfrac{a}{a+b}$. If $X_i \to -\infty$ in this infinte-turn game, Mina receives one unit, and Maxine zero; if $X_i \to \infty$, then these receipts are zero and $x$. Thus the net receipt to a given player is $-A+B$, where $A$ is the sum of her stakes, and $B$ is her terminal receipt. The game was inspired by unbiased tug-of-war in~[PSSW] from 2009 but in fact closely resembles the original version of tug-of-war, introduced [HarrisVickers87] in the economics literature in 1987. We show that the game has surprising features. For a natural class of strategies, Nash equilibria exist precisely when $x$ lies in $[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, for a certain $\lambda \in (0,1)$. We indicate that $\lambda$ is remarkably close to one, proving that $\lambda \leq 0.999904$ and presenting clear numerical evidence that $\lambda \geq 1 - 10^{-4}$. For each $x \in [\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, we find countably many Nash equilibria. Each is roughly characterized by an integral {\em battlefield} index: when the counter is nearby, both players stake intensely, with rapid but asymmetric decay in stakes as it moves away. Our results advance premises [HarrisVickers87,Konrad12] for fund management and the incentive-outcome relation that plausibly hold for many player-funded stake-governed games. Alongside a companion treatment [HP22] of games with allocated budgets, we thus offer a detailed mathematical treatment of an illustrative class of tug-of-war games. We also review the separate developments of tug-of-war in economics and mathematics in the hope that mathematicians direct further attention to tug-of-war in its original resource-allocation guise.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy is among the most widely used load balancing algorithms and has been extensively studied. However, an exact characterization of the system behavior remains challenging. Most prior research has focused on analyzing its performance in the steady state in certain asymptotic regimes, such as the heavy-traffic regime. However, the convergence rate to the steady state in these regimes is often slow, so steady-state and heavy-traffic characterizations may be less informative over practical time horizons. To address this limitation, we provide a finite-time convergence rate analysis of a JSQ system with two symmetric servers. In sharp contrast to the existing literature, we directly study the original system rather than an approximate limiting system such as a diffusion approximation. Our results demonstrate that for such a system, the convergence rate to its steady state, measured in the total variation distance, is $O \left(\frac{1}{(1-\rho)^3} \frac{1}{t} \right)$, where $\rho \in (0,1)$ is the traffic intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large dimension, we study the asymptotic behavior of the mean number of critical points with index k below a level u for an isotropic centered Gaussian random field defined on a family of subsets of $R^d$ depending on d. We prove the existence of three regimes depending on the speed of growth of the volume the parameter set. In the first regime the mean number of critical points decreases exponentially with the dimension. For the second regime, there exists a critical level $u_c$ such that the mean number of critical points with index k below a level u with $u &gt; uc$ increases exponentially with the dimension d independently of the index k and decreases exponentially with d when $u &lt; u_c$. In the third regime, there exists a layered structure depending on the level u considered and on the index $k$ of the critical points. This behavior is similar to the one encountered on the sphere by Auffinger et al. [5]. In the particular case of the Bargmann-Fock field, only two regimes coexist.</description>

Abstract: We derive a new upper bound for the correlations in a heterogeneous one-dimensional Ising model with free boundary conditions. The new upper bound quantifies the simultaneous decay of correlations due to weakness of nearest-neighbor coupling constants and the effect of external fields.

      <title>Optimization in the first-passage problem of a diffusion with Poissonian resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of minimizing the expected first-passage time of a Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting, with respect to the resetting rate $r.$ We consider both the one-boundary and the two-boundary cases.We investigate the first-passage time (FPT) and first-exit time (FET) of a one-dimensional, time-homogeneous diffusion process subject to Poissonian resetting. We first derive a general analytical relationship that expresses the Laplace transform (LT) and the expected value of the FPT (and FET) for the process with resetting in terms of the LT of the FPT (and FET) of the underlying diffusion without resetting. This framework is then applied to determine the optimal resetting rate $r$ that minimizes the expected FPT (and FET). We provide explicit results for drifted Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. For Brownian motion, we extend existing literature by considering the case where the initial position $x$ differs from the resetting position $x_R$, providing a comprehensive parametric analysis. For the OU process, we provide new insights into the minimization of the expected FPT. Our results demonstrate how a strategic choice of the resetting rate can effectively regularize and accelerate the passage through one or two boundaries.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,\alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $G(n,\alpha/n)$.
  Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed-walk graphs, leveraging block-cut trees and ear decompositions, to control the moments of the empirical spectral distribution. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023). As an application, we demonstrate that this improved eigenvalue bound sharpens the parameter requirements on $d$ and $p$ for spontaneous synchronization on random geometric graphs in (Abdalla et al. 2024) under the homogeneous Kuramoto model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While classical concentration inequalities are typically restricted to two special cases -- independence and martingale difference sequences -- we extend concentration inequalities to a much broader class of stochastic processes by relaxing these foundational conditions. %\vspace{0.2\baselineskip} Specifically, heuristically and in the language of calculus, while independence and the martingale difference property correspond to \[ \displaystyle \frac { \partial y } {\partial t}= \text{constant},
  \quad \displaystyle \frac { \partial y } {\partial t} = 0 \] respectively, %\vspace{0.3\baselineskip} we relax these conditions to %\[ \left| \frac { \partial^2 y } {\partial u_i \, \partial t} \right| \le L, \] %thereby allowing the drift $\displaystyle\frac { \partial y } {\partial t}$ to vary with past state $u_i$. \vspace{0.3\baselineskip} a general setting that requires only the existence of a drift $\displaystyle\frac { \partial y } {\partial t}$ which is allowed to vary with the past state. \vspace{0.3\baselineskip} Furthermore, concentration inequalities are established for branching random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the multivariate risk model with common renewal process among the lines of business, and Brownian perturbations. Assuming that the integrated tail distribution of claims is multivariate subexponential, we establish an asymptotic relation for the infinite-time ruin probability. A more explicit expression is given in case of claim distribution from multivariate regular variation. The results indicate the insensitivity of the asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability with respect to Brownian perturbations. Furthermore, we show that a multivariate distribution with finite expectation, that belongs to the class of multivariate dominatedly varying and long-tailed distributions, possesses integrated tail distribution from the class of multivariate subexponential distributions, which makes easier the checking of conditions in the theorem.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the Lorentz mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the total variation distance under two information-erasing maps on inhomogeneous Bernoulli product measures: summation and homogenization. While summation is a Markov kernel and hence satisfies the usual data processing inequality, homogenization -- which maps each Bernoulli parameter to the cumulative mean -- is not. Nevertheless, we prove that the homogenization map also reduces the TV distance, up to a universal constant. The argument is based on an explicit two-sided control of the TV distance between Poisson binomials, obtained via a parameter interpolation and a second-moment extraction lemma.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus as Operator Factorization An Operator-Covariant Derivative and Unified Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for stochastic calculus based on the factorization (Id - E)F = {\delta}_X {\Pi}_X D_X F, valid for F_T^X-measurable F in L^2({\Omega}) when the driving process X has the representation property. For a square-integrable process X with stochastic integral {\delta}_X, we define the operator-covariant derivative D_X := {\delta}_X* as the Hilbert space adjoint of {\delta}_X. Combined with predictable projection {\Pi}_X, this yields a unified Clark-Ocone representation. The operator D_X F is defined as an adjoint for all F in L^2({\Omega}), without differentiability assumptions; the representation holds when X has the predictable representation property, and reduces to the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe projection when it does not. The framework requires no reproducing kernel Hilbert space or Cameron-Martin structure, and applies to non-Gaussian processes. We work out concrete examples including Brownian motion, general continuous martingales, and compensated Poisson processes.</description>

Abstract: We establish sharp rates for propagation of chaos in R\'enyi divergences for interacting diffusion systems at stationarity. Building upon the entropic hierarchy established in Lacker (2023), we show that under strong isoperimetry and weak interaction conditions, one can achieve $\mathsf R_q(\mu^1 \,\lVert\, \pi) = \widetilde O(\frac{d q^2}{N^2})$ bounds on the $q$-R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Extreme Score Distributions in Countable-Outcome Round-Robin Tournaments of Equally Strong Players</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general class of round-robin tournament models of equally strong players. In these models, each of the $n$ players competes against every other player exactly once. For each match between two players, the outcome is a value from a countable subset of the unit interval, and the scores of the two players in a match sum to one. The final score of each player is defined as the sum of the scores obtained in matches against all other players. We study the distribution of extreme scores, including the maximum, second maximum, and lower-order extremes. Since the exact distribution is computationally intractable even for small values of $n$, we derive asymptotic results as the number of players $n$ tends to infinity, including limiting distributions, and rates of convergence.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of singular vector and singular subspace perturbations in the signal-plus-noise matrix model with random Gaussian noise. Assuming a low-rank signal matrix, we extend the Davis-Kahan-Wedin theorem in a fully generalized manner, applicable to any unitarily invariant matrix norm, building on previous results by O'Rourke, Vu, and the author. Our analysis provides fine-grained insights, including $\ell_\infty$ bounds for singular vectors, $\ell_{2, \infty}$ bounds for singular subspaces, and results for linear and bilinear functions of singular vectors. Additionally, we derive $\ell_{2,\infty}$ bounds on perturbed singular vectors, taking into account the weighting by their corresponding singular values. Finally, we explore practical implications of these results in the Gaussian mixture model and the submatrix localization problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for deep neural networks with Gaussian weights and at most linearly growing activation functions, such as ReLU. This generalises earlier work, in which bounded and continuous activation functions were considered. In practice, linearly growing activation functions such as ReLU are most commonly used. We furthermore simplify previous expressions for the rate function and provide a power-series expansions for the ReLU case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust Q-learning algorithm for Markov decision processes under model uncertainty when each state-action pair is associated with a finite ambiguity set of candidate transition kernels. This finite-measure framework enables highly flexible, user-designed uncertainty models and goes beyond the common KL and Wasserstein ball formulations. We establish almost sure convergence of the learned Q-function to the robust optimum, and derive non-asymptotic high-probability error bounds that separate stochastic approximation error from transition-kernel estimation error. Finally, we show that Wasserstein ball and parametric ambiguity sets can be approximated by finite ambiguity sets, allowing our algorithm to be used as a generic solver beyond the finite setting.</description>

      <title>On Resolving Non-Preemptivity in Multitask Scheduling: An Optimal Algorithm in Deterministic and Stochastic Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient scheduling of multi-task jobs across multiprocessor systems has become increasingly critical with the rapid expansion of computational systems. This challenge, known as Multiprocessor Multitask Scheduling (MPMS), is essential for optimizing the performance and scalability of applications in fields such as cloud computing and deep learning. In this paper, we study the MPMS problem under both deterministic and stochastic models, where each job is composed of multiple tasks and can only be completed when all its tasks are finished. We introduce $\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{SRPT}$, a non-preemptive variant of the SRPT algorithm, designed to accommodate scenarios with non-preemptive tasks. Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $\ln \alpha + \beta + 1$ for minimizing response time, where $\alpha$ represents the ratio of the largest to the smallest job workload, and $\beta$ captures the ratio of the largest non-preemptive task workload to the smallest job workload. We further establish that this competitive ratio is order-optimal when the number of processors is fixed. For the stochastic $\mathsf{M}$/$\mathsf{G}$/$\mathsf{N}$ system, we prove that $\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{SRPT}$ achieves asymptotically optimal mean response time as the traffic intensity approaches $1$, assuming task size distribution with finite support. Moreover, the asymptotic optimality extends to infinite task size distributions under mild probabilistic assumptions, including the standard $\mathsf{M}$/$\mathsf{M}$/$\mathsf{N}$ model. Finally, we extend the analysis to the setting of unknown job sizes, proving that non-preemptive adaptations of the $\mathsf{M\text{-}Gittins}$ and $\mathsf{M\text{-}SERPT}$ policies achieve asymptotic optimality and near-optimality, respectively, for a broad class of job size distributions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of $\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{SRPT}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative gradient flow, is transformed to a Liouville partial differential equation (PDE)-based formalism. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck equation-based Monte Carlo is reformulated to Liouville PDE-based transport without the diffusive term, and the involved density estimation is handled by normalizing flows of neural ODE. Next, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is approximated by the Liouville PDE-based SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two efforts show outperforming convergence in training and testing Liouville PDE-based SWF and SWF barycenters with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of this problem is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be unbounded.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemingly moderate strengthening from (1) to (1*) yields an exponential gap in the query complexity.
  Furthermore, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. We also establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality for $\mu$ under these conditions. As an application of our technique, we obtain a new estimate of the modified log-Sobolev constant for a specific class of mixtures of strongly log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>Eliciting reference measures of law-invariant functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Law-invariant functionals are central to risk management and assign identical values to random prospects sharing the same distribution under an atomless reference probability measure. This measure is typically assumed fixed. Here, we adopt the reverse perspective: given only observed functional values, we aim to either recover the reference measure or identify a candidate measure to test for law invariance when that property is not {\em a priori} satisfied. Our approach is based on a key observation about law-invariant functionals defined on law-invariant domains. These functionals define lower (upper) supporting sets in dual spaces of signed measures, and the suprema (infima) of these supporting sets -- if existent -- are scalar multiples of the reference measure. In specific cases, this observation can be formulated as a sandwich theorem. We illustrate the methodology through a detailed analysis of prominent examples: the entropic risk measure, Expected Shortfall, and Value-at-Risk. For the latter, our elicitation procedure initially fails due to the triviality of supporting set extrema. We therefore develop a suitable modification.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In the first part, we define the continuous Yang--Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L\'evy, then we show in the second part how to derive the character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L\'evy and Ma\"ida with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large-$N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

      <title>Diameter Bounds for Friends-and-Strangers Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider two $n$-vertex graphs $X$ and $Y$, where we interpret $X$ as a social network with edges representing friendships and $Y$ as a movement graph with edges representing adjacent positions. The friends-and-strangers graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is a graph on the $n!$ permutations $V(X)\to V(Y)$, where two configurations are adjacent if and only if one can be obtained from the other by swapping two friends located on adjacent positions. Friends-and-strangers graphs were first introduced by Defant and Kravitz, and generalize sliding puzzles as well as token swapping problems. Previous work has largely focused on their connectivity properties.
  In this paper, we study the diameter of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$. We extend the result of Kornhauser, Miller, and Spirakis on sliding puzzles to general graphs in two ways. First, we show that the diameter of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$ is polynomially bounded when both the friendship and the movement graphs have large minimum degree. Second, when both the underlying graphs $X$ and $Y$ are Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, we show that the distance between any pair of configurations is almost always polynomially bounded under certain conditions on the edge probabilities.</description>

      <title>Results of Fractional Rough Burgers equation in $H^s$ space and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of Fractional Rough Burgers equation driven by space-time noise in $H^s(\m T)$ space. For the higher dissipation $\gamma\in(\frac{4}{3},2]$, we establish local well-posedness. Global well-posedness is further obtained when $\gamma$ is restricted to the interval $(\frac{3}{2}, 2]$. For the lower dissipation $\gamma\in(\frac{5}{4},\frac{4}{3}]$, we use the regularity analysis derivation the para-controlled solution.</description>

      <title>Graph Limits via Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new notion of limits of weighted directed graphs of growing size based on convergence of their random quotients. These limits are specified in terms of random exchangeable measures on the unit square. We call our limits grapheurs and show that these are dual to graphons in a precise sense. Grapheurs are well-suited to modeling global structure in large graphs such as hubs and connections between them; previous notions of graph limits based on subgraph densities fail to adequately model such global structure as subgraphs are inherently local. Using our framework, we characterize properties of large graphs that are continuous with respect to our limits and present an edge-based sampling approach for testing them. This method relies on an edge-based analog of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma, whereby we show that sampling a constant number of edges from an arbitrarily-large graph approximately preserves its quotients. Finally, we observe that the random quotients of a graph are related to each other by equipartitions, and we conclude with a characterization of such random graph models.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>
