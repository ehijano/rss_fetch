      <title>Radial evolution of a density structure within a solar wind magnetic sector boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) on the 29$^{\text{th}}$ of April 2021 (during a solar minimum), when the two spacecraft were respectively located at $\sim 0.075$ and $\sim 0.9$~au from the Sun. A previous study of this alignment allowed the identification of the same density enhancement (with a time scale of $\sim$1.5~h), and substructures ($\sim$20-30~min timescale), passing first by PSP, and then SolO after a $\sim 138$~h propagation time in the inner heliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large scale heliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated by radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with longitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the density structure radial size to remain of the order L$_R \sim 10^6$~km, while its longitudinal and latitudinal sizes, are estimated to expand from L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^4$-$10^5$~km in the high solar corona, to L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^5$-$10^6$~km at PSP, and L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^6$-$10^7$~km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure's aspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma's nearly spherical expansion. The structure's shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated in the radial direction at $\sim$2-3 solar radii (high corona), to sizes of nearly the same order in all directions at PSP, and then becoming elongated in the directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not concordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we propose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection near the tip of a coronal streamer.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid Ablation within the Jovian Atmosphere: Implications on the Oxygen Delivery to the Gas Giant's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of water molecules within the atmosphere of Jupiter, first by the Galileo Atmospheric Probe, and later by the Juno spacecraft, has given rise to the question of whether those molecules are sourced endogenously or exogenously. One hypothesis is that the ablation of meteoroids deposited the necessary oxygen into the atmosphere, which was subsequently used in chemical processes to form water. This paper aims to evaluate this hypothesis by simulating the ablation of carbonaceous objects entering the planet's atmosphere to determine the possible rates of oxygen delivery and the most likely altitude for such delivery within the Jovian atmosphere. We estimate that carbonaceous meteoroids have the potential to deliver $\sim 1.4 \times 10^7 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over a billion years. We further estimate that most of the ablation is expected to occur in the stratosphere, or 450-400 km above the region of 1 bar of atmospheric pressure. In comparison, Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) are estimated to deliver roughly $\sim 10^2 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over the same period.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Near-Real Time Thermospheric Density Retrieval Methods from Precise Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Ephemerides During Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the density of the thermosphere during geomagnetic storms is critical for both thermosphere modelling efforts and satellite operations. Accurate near-real time density estimates can feed into data assimilation schemes and provide operators with an early warning system for storm-triggered drag increases. This study evaluates two methods for generating near-real time thermospheric density estimates: the Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR) method and the Precise Orbit Determination (POD)-accelerometry method.
  Using accelerometer-derived densities from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) and Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) spacecraft as truth over 45 geomagnetic storms, the POD accelerometry method was found to surpass EDR density retrieval as well as one commonly used atmospheric density model (DTM2000) in terms of mean absolute percentage error (by 113.30\% and 130.64\%, respectively). The POD accelerometry method is comparable, albeit slightly worse, than two other models: JB2008 (-8.74\%) and NRLMSISE-00 (-22.74\%). These results highlight the potential for near-real-time density inversion to rival models driven by post-processed indices, which outperform these same models in an operational setting, where they rely on forecasted or nowcasted indices.
  By applying the POD accelerometry method along the orbits of three LEO satellite orbits during 80 geomagnetic storms (2001--2024), this study illustrates the potential of POD accelerometry as a near-real-time resource for the thermosphere and satellite operations community. The accompanying codebase facilitates broader adoption of these techniques, advancing both storm-time modelling and operational response capabilities.</description>
