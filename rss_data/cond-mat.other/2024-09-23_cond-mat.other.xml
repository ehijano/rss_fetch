      <title>Fractional Stark Ladders and Novel Quantum Dynamics of Space-time SSH Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate novel quantum dynamics of fractional Stark ladders supported by space-time SSH lattices, unveiling a series of remarkable phenomena: 1. symmetric quasispectrum characterized by electric translation group; 2. robust dynamical localization of electrons under Floquet drives; 3. identification of dynamical edge modes as Floquet time crystals. Intriguingly, the realization of Floquet time crystals in our model does not require electron interactions but emerges from the extraordinary interplay between electromagnetic gauge and lattice degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A Ray Tracing Survey of Asymmetric Operation of the X-ray Rowland Circle Using Spherically Bent Crystal Analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherically bent crystal analyzer (SBCA) is a widely-adopted hard x-ray optic, renowned for its good energy resolution and large collection solid angle. It is frequently employed in synchrotron-based techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) and X-ray Emission Spectroscopy, as well as in the rebirth of laboratory-based X-ray Absorption Fine Strucure (XAFS) and XES, and its predominant use has been in 'symmetric' operation on the Rowland circle. The recent study of Gironda et al. (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2024, 39, 1375) emphasizes the benefits of 'asymmetric' SBCA operation, demonstrating the use of multiple crystal reflections from a single SBCA to broaden its accessible energy range. Furthermore, Gironda et al. demonstrate that asymmetric operation frequently mitigates energy broadening intrinsic to Johann optics and propose that under a specific Rowland circle configuration, designated here the Johann Normal Alignment (JNA), such broadening is eradicated altogether. We report extensive ray tracing simulations to scrutinize the impact of asymmetric configurations on energy broadening and detector plane defocusing. We find that the performance of asymmetric SBCA operation generally exceeds its symmetric counterpart in energy resolution when no analyzer masking is used and, with strategic detector placement, the decrease in detection efficiency due to defocusing can be minimized. Spectroscopic imaging is adversely affected by the detector plane blurring, but rejection of scattering from special environment windows in x-ray Raman imaging is still feasible. These results help inform future, more common implementation of asymmetric reflections with SBCA.</description>

      <title>Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on rf measurement schemes involving costly and complex instrumentation. Here we demonstrate a simple dc measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the dc signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple dc measurement, has a wide band up to 200 GHz, well exceeding that of the typical rf spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal, unlike the conventional rf measurement. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique thus offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits, which is in many ways superior with respect to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical approach to the eigenvalue spectrum of perturbed higher-order exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points are special degeneracy points in parameter space that can arise in (effective) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open quantum and wave systems. At an n-th order exceptional point, n eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce. These coalescing eigenvalues typically exhibit a strong response to small perturbations which can be useful for sensor applications. A so-called generic perturbation with strength $\epsilon$ changes the eigenvalues proportional to the n-th root of $\epsilon$. A different eigenvalue behavior under perturbation is called non-generic. An understanding of the behavior of the eigenvalues for various types of perturbations is desirable and also crucial for applications. We advocate a graph-theoretical perspective that contributes to the understanding of perturbative effects on the eigenvalue spectrum of higher-order exceptional points, i.e. n &gt; 2. To highlight the relevance of non-generic perturbations and to give an interpretation for their occurrence, we consider an illustrative example, a system of microrings coupled by a semi-infinite waveguide with an end mirror. Furthermore, the saturation effect occurring for cavity-selective sensing in such a system is naturally explained within the graph-theoretical picture.</description>

      <title>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes has been experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wavefunction changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Classification-based detection and quantification of cross-domain data bias in materials discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It stands to reason that the amount and the quality of data is of key importance for setting up accurate AI-driven models. Among others, a fundamental aspect to consider is the bias introduced during sample selection in database generation. This is particularly relevant when a model is trained on a specialized dataset to predict a property of interest, and then applied to forecast the same property over samples having a completely different genesis. Indeed, the resulting biased model will likely produce unreliable predictions for many of those out-of-the-box samples. Neglecting such an aspect may hinder the AI-based discovery process, even when high quality, sufficiently large and highly reputable data sources are available. In this regard, with superconducting and thermoelectric materials as two prototypical case studies in the field of energy material discovery, we present and validate a new method (based on a classification strategy) capable of detecting, quantifying and circumventing the presence of cross-domain data bias.</description>

      <title>Transient amplification in stable Floquet media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mathieu equation occurs naturally in the description of vibrations or in the propagation of waves in media with time-periodic refractive index. It is known to lead to exponential parametric instability in some regions of the parameter space. However, even in the stable region the matrix that propagates the initial conditions forward in time is non-normal and therefore it can result in transient amplification. By optimizing over initial conditions as well as initial time we show that significant transient amplifications can be obtained, going beyond the one simply stemming from adiabatic invariance. Moreover, we explore the monodromy matrix in more depth, by studying its $\epsilon$-pseudospectra and Petermann factors, demonstrating that is the degree of non-normality of this matrix that determines the global amplifying features. In the context of wave propagation in time-varying media, this transient behavior allows us to display arbitrary amplification of the wave amplitude that is not due to exponential parametric instability.</description>
