      <title>MHD waves in homogeneous and continuously stratified atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic equations, concepts, and modes of linear, ideal, MHD waves -- slow, Alfv\'en and fast -- are set out and generalised to gravitationally-stratified atmospheres. Particular attention is devoted to mode conversion, wherein the local behavior of a global wave changes from one mode to another in passing through particular atmospheric layers. Exact solutions are explored where available. Eikonal methods -- WKBJ and ray theory -- are described. Although our emphasis is on the theoretical underpinning of the subject, the solar atmospheric heating implications of fast/slow and fast/Alfv\'en conversions are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>OGLE-IV Period-Luminosity relation of the LMC: an analysis using mean and median magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TThe Period-Luminosity (PL) relation for Cepheid variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is crucial for distance measurements in astronomy. This study analyzes the impact of using the median rather than the mean on the PL relation's slope and zero point. It also examines the persistence of the break at approximately 10 days and addresses specification issues in the PL relation model. Using $VI$-band median and mean magnitudes from the OGLE-IV survey, corrected for extinction, we fit the PL relation employing robust $MM$-regression, which features a high breakdown point and robust standard errors. Statistical tests and residual analysis are conducted to identify and correct model deficiencies. Our findings indicate a significant change in the PL relation for Cepheids with periods of 10 days or longer, regardless of whether median or mean magnitudes are used. A bias in the zero point and slope estimators is observed when using median magnitudes instead of mean magnitudes, especially in the $V$-band. By identifying and correcting regression issues and considering the period break, our estimators for slope and zero point are more accurate for distance calculations. Comparative analysis of the models for each band quantifies the bias introduced by using median magnitudes, highlighting the importance of considering the Cepheids' period for accurate location measure results, similar to those obtained using mean magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Giant Eruptions in Massive Stars and their Effect on the Stellar Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant eruptions (GE) in Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are years to decades-long episodes of enhanced mass loss from the outer layers of the star during which the star undergoes major changes in its physical and observed properties. We use the \textsc{mesa} stellar evolution code to model the evolution of a $70~M_{\odot}$ star that undergoes a GE. We let the star evolve to the termination of the main sequence (MS) and when it reaches $T\simeq 19\,400 $ K we emulate a GE by removing mass from its outer layers, at a rate of $0.15~ M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ for 20 years. As mass is being lost, the star contracts and releases a substantial amount of gravitational energy. The star undergoes an initial $\simeq 3$ days of expansion followed by years of contraction. During that time the star tries to reach an equilibrium state and as a result of loss in gravitational energy, its luminosity drops about one order of magnitude. As the GE terminates, we let the star continue to evolve without any further mass loss and track its recovery as it regains its equilibrium by adjusting its internal structure. After $\simeq 87$ years it reaches a state very close to the one where the GE was first initiated. We suggest that at this point another GE or a cycle of GEs may occur.</description>

      <title>The Dusty Aftermath of a Rapid Nova: V5579 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V5579 Sgr was a fast nova discovered in 2008 April 18.784 UT. We present the optical spectroscopic observations of the nova observed from the Castanet Tolosan, SMARTS and CTIO observatories spanning over 2008 April 23 to 2015 May 11. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, typical of an Fe II class nova. The spectra show He I and He II lines along with forbidden lines from N, Ar, S, and O in the nebular phase. The nova showed a pronounced dust formation episode that began about 20 days after the outburst. The dust temperature and mass were estimated using the WISE data from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. The PAH-like features are also seen in the nova ejecta in the mid-IR Gemini spectra taken 522 d after the discovery. Analysis of the light curve indicates values of t$_2$ and t$_3$ about 9 and 13 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of fast nova. The best fit cloudy model of the early decline phase JHK spectra obtained on 2008 May 3 and the nebular optical spectrum obtained on 2011 June 2 shows a hot white dwarf source with T$_{BB}$ $\sim$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K having a luminosity of 9.8 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta is significantly enhanced relative to solar, O/H = 32.2, C/H = 15.5 and N/H = 40.0 in the early decline phase and O/H = 5.8, He/H = 1.5 and N/H = 22.0 in the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Inflight Performance and Calibrations of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) is the first payload to image the full solar disk and the solar corona in both white-light (WL) and ultraviolet (UV) H I Lya, extending up to 2.5 solar radii (Rs). Since the launch of the ASO-S on 9 October 2022, LST has captured various significant solar activities including flares, prominences, coronal mass ejections (CMEs). LST covers different passbands of 121.6 nm, 360 nm and 700 nm. The Lya Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has a field of view (FOV) of 38.4 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 9.5 arcsec, while the White-Light Solar Telescope (WST) has a FOV of 38.43 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 3.0 arcsec. The FOV of the Lya Solar Corona Imager (SCI) reaches 81.1 arcmin and its spatial resolution is 4.3 arcsec. The stray-light level in the 700 nm waveband is about 7.8e-6 MSB (mean solar brightness) at 1.1 Rs and 7.6e-7 MSB at 2.5 Rs, and in the Lya waveband it is around 4.3e-3 MSB at 1.1 Rs and 4.1e-4 MSB at 2.5 Rs. This article will detail the results from on-orbit tests and calibrations.</description>

      <title>Intensities of the hydrogen Balmer lines of solar-like stars revealed by the LAMOST spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensities of the hydrogen Balmer lines of solar-like stars are investigated for stellar chromospheric activity by using the co-source spectral data of the LAMOST Low-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LRS) and Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS). The Balmer H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$ lines in the LRS data and the H$\alpha$ line in the MRS data are analyzed. The absolute flux indexes, defined as the ratios of the absolute fluxes at the centers of the Balmer lines to the stellar bolometric flux, are employed to indicate the intensity magnitudes of the Balmer lines in response to stellar activity. The H$\alpha$ indexes derived from the LRS data and the MRS data, respectively, are calibrated to be quantitatively consistent with each other. It is found that, as the H$\alpha$ index increases, the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$ indexes first present trend of increasing and then decreasing, and finally increase synchronously with the H$\alpha$ index. The distributions of the Balmer line indexes also reveal the three distinct stages of stellar activity (normal stage, intense stage, and extremely intense stage), in which the extremely intense stage is characterized by the synchronous growth of the indexes of the four Balmer lines. The different behaviors of the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$ lines from that of the H$\alpha$ line can be interpreted by the different mechanisms by which the line-core intensities are formed, and the three distinct activity stages imply the very different magnetic field environments and physical conditions of solar-like stars.</description>

      <title>The Infrared Surface Brightness technique applied to RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baade-Wesselink method allows us to estimate distances to individual pulsating stars. Accurate geometric parallaxes obtained by the Gaia mission serve us in the calibration of the method and in the determination of its precision. The method also provides a way of determining mean radii of pulsating stars. The main aim of this work is to determine the scatter and possible dependence of p- factors of RR Lyrae stars on their pulsation periods. The secondary objective is to determine mean radius - period relations for these stars. Our calibrations for RR Lyrae stars are based on photometric data gathered at the Cerro Murphy Observatory. We obtained spectroscopic data specifically for this project using high resolution spectrographs. We use the Infrared Surface Brightness (IRSB) version of the method that relies on a surface brightness - color relation dependent on the (V-K) color. We obtain the spread of p- factors of around 0.07-0.08 for our sample of 9 RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood. However, we also find relations between the p-factor and the pulsation period for RRab stars with the rms scatter around the relation of around 0.05, but with relatively large uncertainty of relations' parameters. We present relations between the mean radius and period for RR Lyrae pulsating in the fundamental mode with the rms scatter around the relation of $0.012R_{\odot}$. We observe a clear offset between p- factors obtained using the IRSB technique (with mean p between 1.39 and 1.45) and values inferred by Bras et al. (2024) using the SPIPS tool (M\'erand et al. 2015). On the other hand, we obtain a similar scatter of p of as observed by Bras et al. (2024). Our period-radius relations are in a good agreement with both the inference of Bras et al. (2024) based on SPIPS and theoretical predictions of Marconi et al. (2005, 2015)</description>

      <title>Exploring Damping Properties of IRIS Bright Points using Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzed the Doppler shift in the solar spectrum using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Two types of oscillations were investigated: long period damp and short period damp. The researchers observed periodic perturbations in the Doppler velocity oscillations of bright points (BPs) in the chromosphere and transition region (TR). Deep learning techniques were used to examine the statistical properties of damping in different solar regions. The results showed variations in damping rates, with higher damping in coronal hole areas. The study provided insights into the damping behavior of BPs and contributed to our understanding of energy dissipation processes in the solar chromosphere and TR.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Beyond Spectroscopy III. Stellar Parameters and Elemental-abundance Ratios for Five Million Stars from DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity $\log g$, age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and \textit{Gaia} EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a Kernel Principal Component Analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good or better than derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10-0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex and 0.40 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun drives a supersonic wind which inflates a giant plasma bubble in our very local interstellar neighborhood, the heliosphere. It is bathed in an extremely variable background of energetic ions and electrons which originate from a number of sources. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the Sun, whereas shocks driven by solar disturbances are observed to accelerate energetic storm particles (ESPs). Moreover, a dilute population with a distinct composition forms the anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) which are of a mixed interstellar-heliospheric origin. Particles are also accelerated at planetary bow shocks. We will present recent observations of energetic particles by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, as well as other spacecraft that allow us to study the acceleration and transport of energetic particles at multiple locations in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>The GRAVITY young stellar object survey XIV : Investigating the magnetospheric accretion-ejection processes in S CrA N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dust- and gas-rich protoplanetary disks around young stellar systems play a key role in star and planet formation. While considerable progress has recently been made in probing these disks on large scales of a few tens of astronomical units (au), the central au needs to be more investigated. We aim at unveiling the physical processes at play in the innermost regions of the strongly accreting T Tauri Star S CrA N by means of near-infrared interferometric observations. The K-band continuum emission is well reproduced with an azimuthally-modulated dusty ring. As the star alone cannot explain the size of this sublimation front, we propose that magnetospheric accretion is an important dust-heating mechanism leading to this continuum emission. The differential analysis of the Hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line is in agreement with radiative transfer models combining magnetospheric accretion and disk winds. Our observations support an origin of the Br$\gamma$ line from a combination of (variable) accretion-ejection processes in the inner disk region.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Planetary Nebula NGC 4361 with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical line and continuum emission in the very high ionization Galactic planetary nebula (PN) NGC 4361 (PN G294.1 +43.6), has been mapped with VLT MUSE Wide Field normal mode (4750-9300A) commissioning observations. The PN is larger than a single MUSE field and only the central 1 arcmin square was observed in good conditions. Images in recombination and collisionally excited emission lines were extracted and line ratios provide dust extinction, electron density and temperature and ionic abundances. The nebula is confirmed as optically thin in the H-ionizing continuum based on its very low He I emission, even to the edges of the field, but is not completely optically thin. The electron temperature Te is shown to have large-scale spatially coherent structure, as indicated from previous spectra. Prior to this study, no low ionization emission had been positively detected; MUSE revealed both weak extended [N II] and [O II] and $&gt;$100 spatially unresolved low ionization knots (dubbed 'Freckles'). There are several linear associations of the Freckles but none point back convincingly to the central star. The Freckle spectra show low-moderate ionization with Te $\sim$11000 K, Ne $\sim$1500 cm$^{-3}$ and higher extinction than the highly ionized medium, but do not clearly differ in (He, N, O, S) abundance with respect to the extended gas. The spatial distribution and radial velocities suggest that the Freckles belong to a thick disk oriented perpendicular to the large-scale nebula, perhaps remnants of an earlier structure. Within the MUSE field, a low redshift emission line galaxy was serendipitously found hiding behind NGC 4361. The spectrum of this dwarf galaxy was extracted from the bright foreground nebular emission: it is a low luminosity disk galaxy at $\sim$87 Mpc with bright H II regions (12+log(O/H) $\sim$ 8.4), probably a Magellanic irregular or low-mass spiral.

      <title>The Kraft Break Sharply Divides Low Mass and Intermediate Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main sequence stars transition at mid-F spectral types from slowly rotating (cooler stars) to rapidly rotating (hotter stars), a transition known as the Kraft Break (Kraft 1967) and attributed the disappearance of the outer convective envelope, causing magnetic braking to become ineffective. To define this Break more precisely, we assembled spectroscopic measurements of 405 F stars within 33.33 pc. Once young, evolved and candidate binary stars are removed, the distribution of projected rotational velocities shows the Break to be well-defined and relatively sharp. Nearly all stars redder than G_BP-G_RP = 0.60 mag are slowly rotating (vsini &lt; 20 km/s), while only 4 of 40 stars bluer than G_BP-G_RP = 0.54 mag are slowly rotating, consistent with that expected for a random distribution of inclinations. The Break is centered at an effective temperature of 6550 K and has a width of about 200 K, corresponding to a mass range of 1.32 - 1.41 M_Sun. The Break is ~450 K hotter than the stellar temperature at which hot Jupiters show a change in their obliquity distribution, often attributed to tidal realignment. The Break, as defined above, is nearly but not fully established in the ~650 Myr Hyades cluster; it should be established in populations older than 1 Gyr. We propose that the Kraft Break provides a more useful division, for both professional and pedagogical purposes, between what are called low mass stars and intermediate mass stars; the Kraft Break is observationally well-defined and is linked to a change in stellar structure.</description>

      <title>Origin of LAMOST J1010+2358 Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signature from Pop III massive stars of $140$--$260\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$. Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Stellar Occultations During the Unprecedented Long-Duration Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strong stellar and solar flares flare loops typically appear during the decay phase, providing an additional contribution to the flare emission and, possibly, obscuring the flare emission. Super-flares, common in active, cool stars, persist mostly from minutes to several hours and alter the star's luminosity across the electromagnetic spectrum. Recent observations of a young main-sequence star reveal a distinctive cool loop arcade forming above the flaring region during a 27-hour superflare event, obscuring the region multiple times. Analysis of these occultations enables the estimation of the arcade's geometry and physical properties. The arcade's size expanded from 0.213 to 0.391 R$_*$ at a speed of approximately 3.5$\,$km/s. The covering structure exhibited a thickness below 12$\,$200$\,$km, with electron densities ranging from 10$^{13}$ to 10$^{14}\,$cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures below 7$\,$600$\,$K, 6$\,$400$\,$K, and 5$\,$077$\,$K for successive occultations. Additionally, the flare's maximum emission temperature has to exceed 12$\,$000$\,$K for the occultations to appear. Comparing these parameters with known values from other stars and the Sun suggests the structure's nature as an arcade of cool flare loops. For the first time, we present the physical parameters and the reconstructed geometry of the cool flare loops that obscure the flaring region during the gradual phase of a long-duration flare on a star other than the Sun.</description>

      <title>AT2023vto: An Exceptionally Luminous Helium Tidal Disruption Event from a Massive Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical/UV observations and the spectroscopic classification of the transient AT2023vto as a tidal disruption event (TDE) at z = 0.4846. The spectrum is dominated by a broad He II $\lambda$4686 emission line, with a width of ~ $3.76 \times 10^4$ km/s and a blueshift of ~ $1.05 \times 10^4$ km/s, classifying it as a member of the TDE-He class. The light curve exhibits a long rise and decline timescale, with a large peak absolute magnitude of M$_g$ ~ -23.6, making it the most luminous of the classical optical TDEs (H, H+He, He) discovered to date by about 2 mag (and ~ 4 mag compared to the mean of the population). The light curve exhibits a persistent blue color of g - r ~ -0.4 mag throughout its evolution, similar to other TDEs, but distinct from supernovae. We identify the host galaxy of AT2023vto in archival Pan-STARRS images and find that the transient is located at the galaxy center, and that its inferred central black hole mass is ~ $10^7~M_{\odot}$. Modeling the light curves of AT2023vto, we find that it resulted from the disruption of a ~ 9 $M_{\odot}$ star by a ~$10^7~M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole. The star mass is about 5 times larger than the highest star masses previously inferred in TDEs, and the black hole mass is at the high end of the distribution. AT2023vto is comparable in luminosity and timescale to some putative TDEs (with a blue featureless continuum), as well as to the mean of the recently identified population of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), although the latter are spectroscopically distinct and tend to have longer timescales. ANTs have been speculated to arise from tidal disruptions of massive stars, perhaps in active galactic nuclei, and AT2023vto may represent a similar case but in a dormant black hole, thereby bridging the TDE and ANT populations. We anticipate that Rubin Observatory / LSST will uncover similar luminous TDEs to z ~ 3.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Accreting companion occurrence rates using a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: Application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alpha line luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-8&lt; log MMdot MJ^2/yr &lt; -2) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Across accretion models, we find consistent accreting companion rates, with median and one-sigma credible intervals of 0.15 (+0.18, -0.10) and 0.19 (+0.23, -0.12). Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Keck-HGCA Pilot Survey II: Direct Imaging Discovery of HD 63754 B, a ~20 au Massive Companion Near the Hydrogen Burning Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the joint astrometric and direct imaging discovery, mass measurement, and orbital analysis of HD 63754 B (HIP 38216 B), a companion near the stellar-substellar boundary orbiting ~20 AU from its Sun-like host. HD 63754 was observed in our ongoing high-contrast imaging survey targeting stars with significant proper-motion accelerations between Hipparcos and Gaia consistent with wide-separation substellar companions. We utilized archival HIRES and HARPS radial velocity (RV) data, together with the host star's astrometric acceleration extracted from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA), to predict the location of the candidate companion around HD 63754 A. We subsequently imaged HD 63754 B at its predicted location using the Near Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) in the $L'$ band at the W. M. Keck Observatory. We then jointly modeled the orbit of HD 63754 B with RVs, Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations, and our new relative astrometry, measuring a dynamical mass of ${81.9}_{-5.8}^{+6.4} M_{jup}$, an eccentricity of ${0.260}_{-0.059}^{+0.065}$, and a nearly face-on inclination of $174.81_{-0.50}^{+0.48}$ degrees. For HD 63754 B, we obtain an L' band absolute magnitude of $L' = 11.39\pm0.06$ mag, from which we infer a bolometric luminosity of $log(L_{bol}/L_{\odot})= -4.55 \pm0.08$ dex using a comparison sample of L and T dwarfs with measured luminosities. Although uncertainties linger in age and dynamical mass estimates, our analysis points toward HD 63754 B's identity as a brown dwarf on the L/T transition rather than a low-mass star, indicated by its inferred bolometric luminosity and model-estimated effective temperature. Future RV, spectroscopic, and astrometric data such as those from JWST and Gaia DR4 will clarify HD 63754 B's mass, and enable spectral typing and atmospheric characterization.</description>

      <title>Streaming Torque in Dust-Gas Coupled Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust-gas coupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to the NSH (Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi 1986) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We find that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close proximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial wavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of $ \tilde{\omega} = \left( 1 + \mu \right) \boldsymbol{W}_s \cdot \boldsymbol{k}$. The emergence of this mode leads to a wake with a short radial length-scale ahead of protoplanets, contributing to a positive torque, termed as ``Streaming Torque (ST)''. Furthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH velocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the coupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates, inducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid inward migration in their formation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Strong Chemical Tagging in FIRE: Intra and Inter-Cluster Chemical Homogeneity in Open Clusters in Milky Way-like Galaxy Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open star clusters are the essential building blocks of the Galactic disk; "strong chemical tagging" - the premise that all star clusters can be reconstructed given chemistry information alone - is a driving force behind many current and upcoming large Galactic spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we characterize abundance patterns for 9 elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe) in open clusters (OCs) in three galaxies (m12i, m12f, and m12m) from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations to investigate if strong chemical tagging is possible in these simulations. We select young massive (&gt;=10^(4.6) Msun) OCs formed in the last ~100 Myr and calculate the intra- and inter-cluster abundance scatter for these clusters. We compare these results with analogous calculations drawn from observations of OCs in the Milky Way. We find the intra-cluster scatter of the observations and simulations to be comparable. While the abundance scatter within each cluster is minimal (&lt;0.020 dex), the mean abundance patterns of different clusters are not unique. We also calculate the chemical difference in intra- and inter-cluster star pairs and find it, in general, to be so small that it is difficult to distinguish between stars drawn from the same OC or from different OCs. Despite tracing three distinct nucleosynthetic families (core-collapse supernovae, white dwarf supernovae, and stellar winds), we conclude that these elemental abundances do not provide enough discriminating information to use strong chemical tagging for reliable OC membership.</description>

      <title>Internal magnetic field structures observed by PSP/WISPR in a filament related coronal mass ejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We track and investigate from white-light data taken with the Wide-field Instrument for Solar PRobe (WISPR) aboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP), localized density enhancements, reflecting small-scale magnetic structures belonging to a filament-related coronal mass ejection (CME). We aim to investigate the 3D location, morphology, and evolution of the internal magnetic fine structures of CMEs. Specifically, we ask: what is their relationship with the filament/source region and the flux rope? The fast tangential motion of the PSP spacecraft during its perihelion permits viewing the same event from multiple angles in short times relative to the event's evolution. Hence, we can derive the three-dimensional information of selected CME features from a single spacecraft using triangulation techniques. We group small-scale structures with roughly similar speeds, longitude and latitude, into three distinct morphological groups. We find twisted magnetic field patterns close to the eastern leg of the CME that may be related to 'horns' outlining the edges of the flux-rope cavity. Aligned thread-like bundles are identified close to the western leg. They may be related to confined density enhancements evolving during the filament eruption. High density blob-like features (magnetic islands) are widely spread in longitude ($\sim$40{\deg}) close to the flanks and rear part of the CME. We demonstrate that CME flux ropes may comprise different morphological groups with a cluster behavior, apart from the blobs which instead span a wide range of longitudes. This may hint either to the three-dimensionality of the post-CME current sheet (CS) or to the influence of the ambient corona in the evolutionary behavior of the CS. Importantly, we show that the global appearance of the CME can be very different in WISPR (0.11--0.16~AU) and instruments near 1~AU because of shorter line-of-sight integration of WISPR.</description>

      <title>Hard X-rays from the deep solar atmosphere. An unusual UV burst with flare properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explosive transient events occur throughout the solar atmosphere. The differing manifestations range from coronal mass ejections to Ellerman bombs. The former may have negligible signatures in the lower atmosphere, and the latter may have negligible nonthermal emissions such as hard X-radiation. A solar flare generally involves a broad range of emission signatures. Using a suite of four space-borne telescopes, we report a solar event that combines aspects of simple UV bursts and hard X-ray emitting flares at the same time. The event is a compact C-class flare in active region AR11861, SOL2013-10-12T00:30. By fitting a combined isothermal and nonthermal model to the hard X-ray spectrum, we inferred plasma temperatures in excess of 15\,MK and a nonthermal power of about $3\times10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ in this event. Despite these high temperatures and evidence for nonthermal particles, the flare was mostly confined to the chromosphere. However, the event lacked clear signatures of UV spectral lines, such as the Fe\,{\sc xii} 1349\,\AA\ and Fe\,{\sc xxi} 1354\,\AA\ emission lines, which are characteristic of emission from hotter plasma with a temperature over 1\,MK. Moreover, the event exhibited very limited signatures in the extreme-UV wavelengths. Our study indicates that a UV burst -- hard X-ray flare hybrid phenomenon exists in the low solar atmosphere. Plasma that heats to high temperatures coupled with particle acceleration by magnetic energy that is released directly in the lower atmosphere sheds light on the nature of active region core heating and on inferences of flare signatures.</description>

Abstract: Circumbinary disks are found in a variety of astrophysical scenarios, spanning binary star formation to accreting supermassive black hole binaries. The interaction with a circumbinary disk can yield opposite effects on the binary orbit leading to circularization, or exciting the eccentricity, widening the orbit or shrinking it and facilitating mergers. We present a new formalism for the long-term evolution of the disk-binary interaction based on the results of recent suites of hydrodynamic simulations, which resolve the complex geometry of the gas in the vicinity of the binary and fully account for the gravitational and accretion forces. We release a python package, \texttt{spindler}, that implements our model. We show that, unless the mass reservoir feeding the disk is comparable to the mass of the binary, accretion onto the binary depletes the disk mass before inducing a significant change in orbital separation or mass ratio. This finding implies that, in most scenarios, interaction with a circumbinary disk is not an efficient mechanism to shrink the orbit of the binary. However, as long as the mass of the disk is at least a few percent of the mass of the binary, the interaction can excite the eccentricity up to an equilibrium value, and induce a statistical correlation between mass ratio and eccentricity. We consider the applicability of our model to a variety of astrophysical scenarios: during star formation, in evolved stellar binaries, triples and in supermassive black hole binaries. We discuss the theoretical and observational implications of our predictions.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat II -- Photometry and proper motions for 1.4 million stars in Omega Centauri and its rotation in the plane of the sky</title>

Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. It is thought to be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy because of its high mass and its complex stellar populations. To decipher its formation history and study its dynamics, we created the most comprehensive kinematic catalog for its inner region, by analyzing both archival and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our catalog contains 1 395 781 proper-motion measurements out to the half-light radius of the cluster ($\sim$5.0') and down to $m_{F625W}\approx$25. The typical baseline for our proper-motion measurements is 20 years, leading to a median 1D proper motion precision of $\sim$11 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for stars with $m_{F625W}\approx$18 mag, with even better precision ($\sim$6.6 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$) achieved in the extensively observed centermost (r$&lt;$1.5') region. In addition to our astrometric measurements, we also obtained precise HST photometry in seven filters spanning from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This allows detailed color-magnitude-diagram studies and to separate the multiple stellar populations of the cluster. In this work, we describe the data reduction used to obtain both the photometric and the proper-motion measurements. We also illustrate the creation and the content of our catalog, which is made publicly available. Finally, we present measurements of the plane-of-sky rotation of $\omega$ Cen in the previously unprobed inner few arcminutes and a precise measurement of the inclination $i = (43.9\pm1.3)^\circ$.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $\sim 4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\sim 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Our models show that, even if it was born inside a stellar cluster, Gaia BH3 is compatible with a primordial binary star that escaped from its parent cluster without experiencing significant dynamical interactions.</description>

      <title>Early emission lines in SN 2024ggi revealed by high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of very early high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a nearby SN that occurred in the galaxy NGC 3621 at a distance of 7.24 Mpc ($z\approx0.002435$). These observations represent the earliest high-resolution spectra of a Type II SN ever made. We analyzed the very early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi obtained in a short interval at 20.6 and 27.8 h after its discovery, or 26.6 and 33.8 h after the SN first light. Observations were obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph MIKE ($R \approx 22600 - 28000$) at the 6.5 m Magellan Clay Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory, on the night of April 12, 2024 UT. We analyzed the evolution of ions of HI, HeI, HeII, NIII, CIII, SiIV, NIV and CIV detected across the spectra. We modeled these features with multiple Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, and estimated their velocities and full widths at half maximum (FWHMs). The spectra show asymmetric emission lines of HI, HeII, CIV, and NIV that can be described by narrow Gaussian cores with broader Lorentzian wings, and symmetric narrow emission lines of HeI, NIII, and CIII. The emission lines of HeI are detected only in the first spectrum, indicating the rapid ionization of HeI to HeII. The narrow components of the emission lines show a systematic blueshift relative to their zero-velocity position, with an increase of $\sim18$ km s$^{-1}$ in the average velocity between the two epochs. The broad Lorentzian components show a blueshift in velocity relative to the narrow components, and a significant increase in the average velocity of $\sim103$ km s$^{-1}$. Such a rapid evolution and significant ionization changes in a short period of time were never observed before, and are probably a consequence of the radiative acceleration generated in the SN explosion.</description>

      <title>A census of new globular clusters in the Galactic bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of known globular clusters in the Galactic bulge has been increasing steadily thanks to different new surveys. The aim of this study is to provide a census of the newly revealed globular clusters in the Galactic bulge, and analyze their characteristics. In recent years, many globular clusters have been discovered or identified. The stellar populations to which they belong are indicated in their original studies: they are mostly bulge clusters, with some identified as disk or halo members. We collected 41 new globular clusters revealed in the last decade and compared them to the known bulge clusters. The new clusters are intrinsically faint with $M_V$ of around -6.0 mag. The distance to the Sun of the ensemble of well-known and new bulge clusters is compatible with the Galactocentric distance measurements from the Galactic black hole location. The ensemble sample shows metallicity peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -1.08 $\pm$ 0.35 and -0.51 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, confirming previous findings. The age-metallicity relation of the new clusters younger than 10 Gyr is compatible with that of the ex situ samples of the dwarf galaxies Sagittarius, Canis Majoris, and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. The clusters with ages between 11.5 and 13.5 Gyr show no age-metallicity relation, because they are all old. This is compatible with their formation in situ in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Production of $^{44}$Ti and Nickel Isotopes in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report nucleosynthetic results for both $^{44}$Ti and nickel isotopes for eighteen three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations extended to $\sim$20 seconds after bounce. We find that many of our long-term models are able to achieve $^{44}$Ti/$^{56}$Ni ratios similar to that observed in Cassiopeia A, and modern supernova models can synthesize up to $2\times10^{-4}M_\odot$ of $^{44}$Ti. Neutrino-driven winds and the fact that there can be simultaneous accretion and explosion in 3D models of core-collapse supernovae play central roles in its production. We conclude that the $^{44}$Ti underproduction problem in previous CCSN models is no longer an issue. In addition, we discuss the production of both $^{57}$Ni and stable nickel/iron ratios and compare our results to observations of SN1987A and the Crab.</description>
