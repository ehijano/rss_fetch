      <title>Omega Results for The Divisor and Circle Problems Using The Resonance Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the resonance method to obtain large values of general exponential sums with positive coefficients. As applications, we show improved $\Omega$-bounds for Dirichlet and Piltz divisor problems, Gauss circle Problem, and error term for the mean square of the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet $L$-function.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound for Zeros in The Character Table of The Symmetric Group with an n-Core Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $N$, let $\chi_{\lambda}(\mu)$ denote the value of the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_{N}$ associated with $\lambda$, evaluated at the conjugacy class of elements whose cycle type is determined by $\mu$. The quantity $Z_{t}(N)$ is defined as $$ Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \quad \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}. $$ We establish the bound $$ \max\limits_{1\leq t \leq N} Z_{t}(N) \geq c_{t}(N)p(N-t)\geq \frac{2\pi p(N)^{2}}{1.01e\sqrt{6N}\log N} \biggl(1+O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log N)\biggr), $$ where $p(N)$ denotes the number of partitions of $N$. Also, we give lower bounds for $Z_{t}(N)$ in different ranges of $t$ and obtain a lower bound for the total number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>

      <title>Recursion formulas for the Fourier coefficients of Siegel Eisenstein series of an odd prime level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we treat the Fourier coefficients of Siegel Eisenstein series of level $p$ with trivial or quadratic character, for an odd prime $p$. The Euler $p$-factor of the Fourier coefficient is called the ramified Siegel series. First we show that the ramified Siegel series attached to each cusp can be decomposed to $U(p)$-eigenfunctions explicitly, next we give recursion formulas of such $U(p)$-characteristic ramified Siegel series.</description>

      <title>Period Function of Maass forms from Ramanujan's Lost Notebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lost Notebook of Ramanujan contains a number of beautiful formulas, one of which can be found on its page 220. It involves an interesting function, which we denote as $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$. In this paper, we show that $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ belongs to the category of period functions as it satisfies the period relations of Maass forms in the sense of Lewis and Zagier \cite{lz}. Hence, we refer to $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ as the \emph{Ramanujan period function}. Moreover, one of the salient aspects of the Ramanujan period function $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ that we found out is that it is a Hecke eigenfunction under the action of Hecke operators on the space of periods. We also establish that it naturally appears in a Kronecker limit formula of a certain zeta function, revealing its connections to various topics. Finally, we generalize $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ to include a parameter $s,$ connecting our work to the broader theory of period functions developed by Bettin and Conrey \cite{bc} and Lewis and Zagier \cite{lz}. We emphasize that Ramanujan was the first to study this function, marking the beginning of the study of period functions.</description>

      <title>Doubling modulo odd integers, generalizations, and unexpected occurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The starting point of this work is an equality between two quantities $A$ and $B$ found in the literature, which involve the {\em doubling-modulo-an-odd-integer} map, i.e., $x\in {\mathbb N} \mapsto 2x \bmod{(2n+1)}$ for some positive integer $n$. More precisely, this doubling map defines a permutation $\sigma_{2,n}$ and each of $A$ and $B$ counts the number $C_2(n)$ of cycles of $\sigma_{2,n}$, hence $A=B$. In the first part of this note, we give a direct proof of this last equality. To do so, we consider and study a generalized $(k,n)$-perfect shuffle permutation $\sigma_{k,n}$, where we multiply by an integer $k\ge 2$ instead of $2$, and its number $C_k(n)$ of cycles. The second part of this note lists some of the many occurrences and applications of the doubling map and its generalizations in the literature: in mathematics (combinatorics of words, dynamical systems, number theory, correcting algorithms), but also in card-shuffling, juggling, bell-ringing, poetry, and music composition.</description>

      <title>A modular framework for generalized Hurwitz class numbers III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $2003$, Pei and Wang introduced higher level analogs of the classical Cohen--Eisenstein series. In recent joint work with Beckwith, we found a weight $\frac{1}{2}$ sesquiharmonic preimage of their weight $\frac{3}{2}$ Eisenstein series under $\xi_{\frac{1}{2}}$ utilizing a construction from seminal work by Duke, Imamo\={g}lu and T\'{o}th. In further joint work with Beckwith, when restricting to prime level, we realized our preimage as a regularized Siegel theta lift and evaluated its (regularized) Fourier coefficients explicitly. This relied crucially on work by Bruinier, Funke and Imamo\={g}lu. In this paper, we extend both works to higher weights. That is, we provide a harmonic preimage of Pei and Wang's generalized Cohen--Eisenstein series under $\xi_{\frac{3}{2}-k}$, where $k &gt; 1$. Furthermore, when restricting to prime level, we realize them as outputs of a regularized Shintani theta lift of a higher level holomorphic Eisenstein series, which builds on recent work by Alfes and Schwagenscheidt. Lastly, we evaluate the regularized Millson theta lift of a higher level Maass--Eisenstein series, which is known to be connected to the Shintani theta lift by a differential equation by earlier work of Alfes and Schwagenscheidt.</description>

      <title>On the locally analytic $\text{Ext}^1$-conjecture in the $\text{GL}_2(L)$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We calculate the dimension of $\text{Ext}^1$-groups of certain locally analytic representations of $\text{GL}_2(L)$ defined using coherent cohomology of Drinfeld curves. Furthermore, let $\rho_p$ be a $2$-dimensional continuous representation of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$, which is de Rham with parallel Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$ and whose underlying Weil-Deligne representation is irreducible. We prove Breuil's locally analytic $\text{Ext}^1$ conjecture for such $\rho_p$. As an application, we show that the isomorphism class of the multiplicity space $\Pi^{\text{an}}_{\text{geo}}(\rho_p)$ of $\rho_p$ in the pro-\'etale cohomology of Drinfeld curves uniquely determines the isomorphism class of $\rho_p$.</description>

      <title>The Igusa Zeta function of restricted power series over $\mathbb{Q}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we ask whether the Igusa zeta function of a restricted power series over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be determined solely from the terms of degree at most $D$. That is, we ask whether the truncated polynomial $f_D$, consisting of all terms of f of degree $\leq D$, yields the same Igusa zeta function as $f$ for sufficiently large $D$. Our main results include a counterexample already in the one-variable case, but also a positive result under the condition that $f$ is sufficiently non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron $\Gamma(f)$.</description>

      <title>Modularity of tadpole Nahm sums in ranks 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 2016, Calinescu, Milas and Penn conjectured that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with the $r\times r$ tadpole Cartan matrix is modular, and they provided a proof for $r=2$. The $r=3$ case was recently resolved by Milas and Wang. We prove this conjecture for the next cases $r=4,5$. We also prove the modularity of some companion Nahm sums by establishing the corresponding Rogers--Ramanujan type identities. A key new ingredient in our proofs is some rank reduction formulas which allow us to decompose higher rank tadpole Nahm sums to mixed products of some lower rank Nahm-type sums and theta functions.</description>

      <title>On the Reflective Symmetry of the Mother Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. Previous efforts have made progress on finding such numbers using graph-theoretical and finite-state-machine constructions. These are the mother graph and the Hoey-Sloane machine (and its state graph). In this paper, we use the reflective symmetry of the mother graph as a starting point for understanding relationships between permutiple classes and how new classes can be determined from old. Such results are not only useful for finding new permutiples from old, they help us to see previous work through a new lens.</description>

We also prove that the Hiraga--Ichino--Ikeda conjecture on the formal degree of essentially square-integrable irreducible representations holds for this parametrization if it is bijective.</description>

      <title>On unitary Shimura varieties at ramified primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider unitary Shimura varieties at places where the totally real field ramifies over $\mbQ$. Our first result constructs comparison isomorphisms between absolute and relative local models in this context which relies on a reformulation of the Eisenstein condition of Rapoport--Zink and Rapoport--Smithling--Zhang. Our second result lifts this comparison to categories of $p$-divisible groups and, as a corollary, to various kinds of Rapoport--Zink spaces. This unifies multiple previously known results in this direction. Our third result and main application is to the arithmetic transfer conjecture of the third author. Using our statements about Rapoport--Zink spaces, we extend his previous proof from the unramified case to that of all $p$-adic local fields (for odd $p$). In general, our results have similar applications to other problems around the arithmetic of Shimura varieties as well, removing several ramification assumptions in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the Pseudonullity of Fine Selmer groups over function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00499v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve $E$ over a global field is a subgroup of the classical $p^\infty$-Selmer group. Coates and Sujatha discovered that the structure of the fine Selmer group of $E$ over certain $p$-adic Lie extensions of a number field is intricately related to some deep questions in classical Iwasawa theory. Inspired by a conjecture of Greenberg, they made prediction about the structure of the fine Selmer group over certain $p$-adic Lie extensions of a number field, which they called Conjecture B. In this article, we discuss some new cases of Conjecture B and its analogues over some $p$-adic Lie extensions of function fields of characteristic $p$.</description>

Abstract: For the integral canonical model $\mathscr{S}_{\mathsf{K}^p}$ of a Shimura variety $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$ of abelian type at hyperspecial level $K_0=\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, we construct a prismatic $F$-gauge model for the `universal' $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-local system on $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$. We use this to obtain several new results about the $p$-adic geometry of Shimura varieties, notably an abelian-type analogue of the Serre--Tate deformation theorem (realizing an expectation of Drinfeld in the abelian-type case) and a prismatic characterization of these models at individual level.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility criteria for pairs of polynomials whose resultant is a prime number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain various irreducibility criteria for pairs of polynomials $(f(X),g(X))$ with integer coefficients whose resultant $Res(f,g)$ is a prime number, or is divisible by a sufficiently large prime number, and also for some of their linear combinations $Mf(X)+Ng(X)$ with integer scalars $M$ and $N$. In particular, we find irreducibility conditions for polynomials with coefficients obtained by representing primes by certain quadratic forms. The irreducibility criteria will appear as corollaries of more general results providing upper bounds for the number of irreducible factors of each one of $f$ and $g$, counting multiplicities, that depend on the prime factorization of $Res(f,g)$, and on the distances between the roots of $f$ and those of $g$. Similar results will be also obtained for pairs of bivariate polynomials $(f(X,Y),g(X,Y))$ over an arbitrary field $K$, using information on the canonical decomposition of their resultant $Res_Y(f,g)$, and on the location of their roots in an algebraic closure of $K(X)$, studied in a non-Archimedean setting.</description>

      <title>Companion points and locally analytic socle conjecture for Steinberg case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13242v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will modify the Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's (more generally, resp., Breuil-Ding's) local model for the trianguline variety (resp., Bernstein paraboline variety) to certain semistable (resp., potentially semistable) non-crystalline point with regular Hodge-Tate weights.Then we deduce several local-global compatibility results, including a classicality result, and the existence of expected companion points on the (definite) eigenvariety and locally analytic socle conjecture for such semistable non-crystalline Galois representations, under certain hypothesis on trianguline variety and the usual Taylor-Wiles assumptions. Moreover, we also discuss slightly the coherent sheaves obtained by patching argument and the coherent sheaves which are constructed from local models and Bezrukavnikov functor, under the route of the recently work of Hellmann-Hernandez-Schraen.</description>

      <title>Isolated points on modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study isolated points on the modular curves $X_{H}$, for $H$ a subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z})$ for some $n \geq 1$. In particular, we prove a single-source theorem for such isolated points, which traces the existence of all such isolated points with the same $j$-invariant back to an isolated point on a single curve. Building on this result, we also present a uniform strategy for determining the isolated points on any family of modular curves. As an example, we use this strategy to classify the isolated points with rational $j$-invariant on all modular curves of level 7, as well as the modular curves $X_{0}(n)$, the latter assuming a conjecture on images of Galois representations of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of $\operatorname{SL}(2,{\mathbb N})$-saturated Farey fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the ordered set ${\mathscr S}_Q$ of Farey fractions $d/b$ of order $Q$ with the property that there exists a matrix $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{smallmatrix} \right) \in \operatorname{SL}(2,{\mathbb Z})$ of trace at most $Q$, with positive entries and $a\ge \max\{ b,c\}$. For every $Q\ge 3$, the set ${\mathscr S}_Q \cup \{ 0\}$ defines a unimodular partition of the interval $[0,1]$. We prove that the elements of ${\mathscr S}_Q$ are asymptotically distributed with respect to the probability measure with density $ (1/(1+x) -1/(2+x) )/\log (4/3) $ and that the sequence of sets $({\mathscr S}_Q)_Q$ has a limiting gap distribution as $Q\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>The first moment of central value of primitive quartic $L$-functions with fixed genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mean value of the first moment of primitive quartic $L$-functions over $\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ in the non-Kummer setting. Specifically, we study the sum
  \begin{equation*}
  \sum_{\substack{\chi\ primitive\ quartic\\ \chi^2 primitive\\ genus(\chi)=g}}L_q(\frac{1}{2}, \chi),
  \end{equation*} where $L_q(s,\chi)$ denotes the $L$-function associated with primitive quartic character $\chi$. Using double Dirichlet series, we derive an error term of size $q^{(\frac{3}{5}+\varepsilon)g}$.</description>

      <title>A mixed characteristic analogue of the perfection of rings and its almost Cohen-Macaulay property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a complete Noetherian local domain of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field, we construct a perfectoid ring which is similar to an explicit representation of a perfect closure in positive characteristic. Then we demonstrate that this perfectoid ring is almost Cohen-Macaulay in the sense of almost ring theory. The proof of this result uses Andr\'e's flatness lemma along with Riemann's extension theorem. We stress that the idea partially originates from the "perfectoidization" in the theory of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <title>The tempered disk and the tempered cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-archimedean valuation ring V (K its fraction field, in mixed characteristic): inspired by some views presented by Scholze, we introduce a new point of view on the non-archimedean analytic setting in terms of derived analytic geometry (then associating a "spectrum" to each ind-Banach algebra). We want to look at the behaviour of this spectrum from a differential point of view. In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open subsets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analogue to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence in the Berkovich spaces). As a dividend of such a theory, we define a new cohomology theory in terms of the Hodge-completed derived de Rham cohomology of the ind-Banach derived analytic space associated to a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V), via the use of "tempered tubes".
  We finally compare our tempered de Rham cohomology with crystalline cohomology.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Bias Framework: Resonance, Structure, and Arithmetic in Quadrature Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trapezoidal rule for periodic functions on uniform grids and show that the quadrature error exhibits a rich deterministic structure, beyond traditional asymptotic or statistical interpretations. Focusing on the prototype function f(x) = sin^2(2 pi k x), we derive an analytical expression for the error governed by a resonance function chi_P(y), closely related to the Dirichlet kernel, roots of unity, and discrete Fourier analysis on the group Z/PZ. This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.</description>

      <title>Completion of motivic sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24033v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the process of $\ell$-adic completion of motivic sheaves. We observe that, in equal characteristic, when restricted to constructible objets, it is compatible with the six operations. This implies that one can reconstruct $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric origin over a scheme of finite type over a field from $\ell$-adic cohomology of smooth schemes. In the case of finite fields, this includes perverse $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric orgin. However, the analogous behaviour fails systematically in mixed characteristic: the reason is that it would imply strong independence of $\ell$ results that can be proven to be too optimistic.</description>
