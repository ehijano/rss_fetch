      <title>Universality of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Approach to Predicting Magnetization in Quasi-One-Dimensional Ising Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph-based deep learning framework for predicting the magnetic properties of quasi-one-dimensional Ising spin systems. The lattice geometry is encoded as a graph and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained on Monte Carlo simulation data and accurately reproduces key features of the magnetization curve, including plateaus, critical transition points, and the effects of geometric frustration. It captures both local motifs and global symmetries, demonstrating that GNNs can infer magnetic behavior directly from structural connectivity. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of magnetization without the need for additional Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Learning of Magnetic Frustration in Artificial Spin Ice from Magnetic Force Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.</description>

      <title>Many-body delocalization with a two-dimensional 70-qubit superconducting quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a 70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits, with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.</description>
