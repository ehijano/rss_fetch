      <title>Topologies derived from the old one via ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to introduce and study minimal and maximal ideals defined on ideal topological spaces. Also, we define and investigate the concepts of ideal quotient and annihilator of any subfamily of $2^X$, where $2^X$ is the power set of $X.$ We obtain some of their fundamental properties. In addition, several relationships among the above notions have been discussed. Moreover, we get a new topology, called sharp topology via the sharp operator defined in the scope of this study, finer than the old one. Furthermore, a decomposition of the notion of open set has been obtained. Finally, we conclude our work with some interesting applications.</description>

      <title>On stratifications and poset-stratified spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stratified space is a topological space equipped with a \emph{stratification}, which is a decomposition or partition of the topological space satisfying certain extra conditions. More recently, the notion of poset-stratified space, i.e., topological space endowed with a continuous map to a poset with its Alexandrov topology, has been popularized. Both notions of stratified spaces are ubiquitous in mathematics, ranging from investigations of singular structures in algebraic geometry to extensions of the homotopy hypothesis in higher category theory. In this article we study the precise mathematical relation between these different approaches to stratified spaces.</description>

      <title>A Boolean-valued space approach to separation axioms and sobriety of bitopological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of separation axioms and sobriety of bitopological spaces from the point of view of fuzzy topology via identifying bitopological spaces with topological spaces valued in the Boolean algebra of four elements. A system of separation axioms is proposed making use of Boolean-valued specialization order of bitopological spaces; The relationship between d-sobriety of bitopological spaces proposed by Jung and Moshier and sobriety of fuzzy topological spaces is studied; A Hofmann-Mislove theorem for bitopological spaces is established.</description>
