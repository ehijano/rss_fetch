      <title>Underground Freight Transportation for Package Delivery in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of underground freight transportation (UFT) is gaining attention because of its ability to quickly move freight to locations in urban areas while reducing road traffic and the need for delivery drivers. Since packages are transported through the tunnels by electric motors, the use of tunnels is also environmentally friendly. Unlike other UFT projects, we examine the use of tunnels to transport individual orders, motivated by the last mile delivery of goods from e-commerce providers. The use of UFT for last mile delivery requires more complex network planning than for direct lines that have previously been considered for networks connecting large cities. We introduce a new network design problem based on this delivery model and transform the problem into a fixed charge multicommodity flow problem with additional constraints. We show that this problem, the nd-UFT, is NP-hard, and provide an exact solution method for solving large-scale instances. Our solution approach exploits the combinatorial sub-structures of the problem in a cutting planes fashion, significantly reducing the time to find optimal solutions on most instances compared to a MIP. We provide computational results for real urban environments to build a set of insights into the structure of such networks and evaluate the benefits of such systems. We see that a budget of only 45 miles of tunnel can remove 42% of packages off the roads in Chicago and 32% in New York City. We estimate the fixed and operational costs for implementing UFT systems and break them down into a per package cost. Our estimates indicate over a 40% savings from using a UFT over traditional delivery models. This indicates that UFT systems for last mile delivery are a promising area for future research.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Proximal Coordinate Gradient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by approximation Bayesian computation using mean-field variational approximation and the computation of equilibrium in multi-species systems with cross-interaction, this paper investigates the composite geodesically convex optimization problem over multiple distributions. The objective functional under consideration is composed of a convex potential energy on a product of Wasserstein spaces and a sum of convex self-interaction and internal energies associated with each distribution. To efficiently solve this problem, we introduce the Wasserstein Proximal Coordinate Gradient (WPCG) algorithms with parallel, sequential and random update schemes. Under a quadratic growth (QC) condition that is weaker than the usual strong convexity requirement on the objective functional, we show that WPCG converges exponentially fast to the unique global optimum. In the absence of the QG condition, WPCG is still demonstrated to converge to the global optimal solution, albeit at a slower polynomial rate. Numerical results for both motivating examples are consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On existence of solutions to non-convex minimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the optimal value and existence of solutions to a general problem of minimizing a proper closed function over a nonempty closed set. The conditions require an asymptotically bounded decay of a function, a relaxation of p-supercoercivity, and a certain relation for the asymptotic cone of the constraint set and the asymptotic function of the objective function. Our analysis combines these conditions with a regularization technique. We refine the notion of retractive directions of a set, extend its definition to functions, and establish some basic relations for such directions for both sets and functions. Using these tools, we provide existence of solutions results that generalize many of the results in the literature for both non-convex and convex problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Workforce Scheduling and Relocation in Hyperconnected Parcel Logistic Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of e-commerce during the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the major challenges for many parcel logistics companies is to design reliable and flexible scheduling algorithms to meet uncertainties of parcel arrivals as well as manpower supplies in logistic hubs, especially for those depending on workforce greatly. Currently, most labor scheduling is periodic and limited to single facility, thus the number of required workers in each hub is constrained to meet the peak demand with high variance. We approach this challenge, recognizing that not only workforce schedules but also working locations could be dynamically optimized by developing a dynamic workforce scheduling and relocation system, fed from updated data with sensors and dynamically updated hub arrival demand predictions. In this paper, we propose novel reactive scheduling heuristics to dynamically match predicted arrivals with shifts at hyperconnected parcel logistics hubs. Dynamic scheduling and allocation mechanisms are carried out dynamically during delivery periods to spatiotemporally adjust the available workforce. We also include penalty costs to keep parcels sorted in time and scheduling adjustments are made in advance to allow sufficient time for crew planning. To assess the proposed methods, we conduct comprehensive case studies based on real-world parcel logistic networks of a logistic company in China. The results show that our proposed approach can significantly outperform traditional workforce scheduling strategies in hubs with limited computation time.</description>

      <title>Variational analysis of unbounded and discontinuous generalized eigenvalue functions with application to topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum (or minimum) generalized eigenvalue of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices that depend on optimization variables often appears as objective or constraint functions in structural topology optimization when we consider robustness, vibration, and buckling. It can be an unbounded or discontinuous function where matrices become singular (where a topological change of the structural design occurs). Based on variational analysis, we redefine the maximum (and minimum) generalized eigenvalue function as an extended real-valued function and propose a real-valued continuous approximation of it. Then, we show that the proposed approximation epi-converges to the original redefined function, which justifies solving problems with the approximation instead. We consider two specific topology optimization problems: robust compliance optimization and eigenfrequency optimization and conduct simple numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Multigrid-in-time preconditioners for KKT systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop multigrid-in-time preconditioners for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems that arise in the solution of time-dependent optimization problems. We focus on a specific instance of KKT systems, known as augmented systems, which underpin the composite-step sequential quadratic programming framework [1]. To enable time-domain decomposition, our approach introduces virtual state variables and continuity constraints at each discrete time interval. The virtual state variables not only facilitate a decoupling in time but also give rise to fixed-point iterations that aid the solution of KKT systems. These fixed-point schemes can be used either as preconditioners for Krylov subspace methods or as smoothers for multigrid-in-time schemes. For the latter, we develop a block-Jacobi scheme that parallelizes trivially in the time domain. To complete the multigrid construction, we use simple prolongation and restriction operators based on geometric multigrid ideas, and a coarse-grid solver based on a GMRES iteration preconditioned with the symmetric block Gauss-Seidel scheme. We present two optimal control examples, involving the viscous Burgers' and van der Pol oscillator equations, respectively, and demonstrate algorithmic scalability.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze the pointwise controllability properties of a one-dimensional degenerate/singular equation. We prove the conditions that characterize approximate and null controllability. Besides, a numerical simulation based on B-splines will be provided, in which the state $u$ and the control function $h$ are represented in terms of B-spline basis functions.

      <title>The Riemannian geometry of Sinkhorn divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new metric between probability measures on a compact metric space that mirrors the Riemannian manifold-like structure of quadratic optimal transport but includes entropic regularization. Its metric tensor is given by the Hessian of the Sinkhorn divergence, a debiased variant of entropic optimal transport. We precisely identify the tangent space it induces, which turns out to be related to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). As usual in Riemannian geometry, the distance is built by looking for shortest paths. We prove that our distance is geodesic, metrizes the weak-star topology, and is equivalent to a RKHS norm. Still it retains the geometric flavor of optimal transport: as a paradigmatic example, translations are geodesics for the quadratic cost on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also show two negative results on the Sinkhorn divergence that may be of independent interest: that it is not jointly convex, and that its square root is not a distance because it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Newton Method for ODE Optimal Tracking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyses a continuous optimization approach to solve optimal control problems involving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and tracking type objectives. Our aim is to determine control or input functions, and potentially uncertain model parameters, for a dynamical system described by an ODE. We establish the mathematical framework and define the optimal control problem with a tracking functional, incorporating regularization terms and box-constraints for model parameters and input functions. Treating the problem as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we employ a Gauss-Newton method within a suitable function space framework. This leads to an iterative process where, at each step, we solve a linearization of the problem by considering a linear surrogate model around the current solution estimate. The resulting linear auxiliary problem resembles a linear-quadratic ODE optimal tracking control problem, which we tackle using either a gradient descent method in function spaces or a Riccati-based approach. Finally, we present and analyze the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Untangling Lariats: Subgradient Following of Variationally Penalized Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel subgradient following apparatus for calculating the optimum of convex problems with variational penalties. In this setting, we receive a sequence $y_i,\ldots,y_n$ and seek a smooth sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. The smooth sequence attains the minimum Bregman divergence to an input sequence with additive variational penalties in the general form of $\sum_i g_i(x_{i+1}-x_i)$. We derive, as special cases of our apparatus, known algorithms for the fused lasso and isotonic regression. Our approach also facilitates new variational penalties such as non-smooth barrier functions. We next derive and analyze multivariate problems in which $\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and variational penalties that depend on $\|\mathbf{x}_{i+1}-\mathbf{x}_i\|$. The norms we consider are $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ which promote group sparsity. Last but not least, we derive a lattice-based subgradient following for variational penalties characterized through the output of arbitrary convolutional filters. This paradigm yields efficient solvers for problems in which sparse high-order discrete derivatives such as acceleration and jerk are desirable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topology optimization governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using a phase field model. Novel stabilized semi-implicit schemes for the gradient flows of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard types are proposed for solving the resulting optimal control problem. Unconditional energy stability is shown for the gradient flow schemes in continuous and discrete spaces. Numerical experiments of computational fluid dynamics in 2d and 3d show the effectiveness and robustness of the optimization algorithms proposed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SQP Method for Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the SQP method applied to a hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem is considered. The model arises from the acoustic full waveform inversion in the time domain. The analysis is mainly challenging due to the involved hyperbolicity and second-order bilinear structure. This notorious character leads to an undesired effect of loss of regularity in the SQP method, calling for a substantial extension of developed parabolic techniques. We propose and analyze a novel strategy for the well-posedness and convergence analysis based on the use of a smooth-in-time initial condition, a tailored self-mapping operator, and a two-step estimation process along with Stampacchia's method for second-order wave equations. Our final theoretical result is the R-superlinear convergence of the SQP method.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance Analysis of Discrete-Time ReLU Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for the stability and $\ell_2$-gain performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with ReLU activation functions. These conditions are derived by combining Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with Quadratic Constraints (QCs) satisfied by repeated ReLUs. We write a general class of QCs for repeated RELUs using known properties for the scalar ReLU. Our stability and performance condition uses these QCs along with a "lifted" representation for the ReLU RNN. We show that the positive homogeneity property satisfied by a scalar ReLU does not expand the class of QCs for the repeated ReLU. We present examples to demonstrate the stability / performance condition and study the effect of the lifting horizon.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We consider the second-order cone function (SOCF) $f: {\mathbb R}^n \to \mathbb R$ defined by $f(x)= c^T x + d -\|A x + b \|$. Every SOCF is concave. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for strict concavity of $f$. The parameters $A \in {\mathbb R}^{m \times n}$ and $b \in {\mathbb R}^m$ are not uniquely determined. We show that every SOCF can be written in the form $f(x) = c^T x + d -\sqrt{\delta^2 + (x-x_*)^TM(x-x_*)}$. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the parameters $c$, $d$, $\delta$, $M = A^T A$, and $x_*$ to be uniquely determined. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for $f$ to be bounded above.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a neural network based solver for optimal control problems (without / with box constraint) for linear and semilinear second-order elliptic problems. It utilizes a coupled system derived from the first-order optimality system of the optimal control problem, and employs deep neural networks to represent the solutions to the reduced system. We present an error analysis of the scheme, and provide $L^2(\Omega)$ error bounds on the state, control and adjoint in terms of neural network parameters (e.g., depth, width, and parameter bounds) and the numbers of sampling points. The main tools in the analysis include offset Rademacher complexity and boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of neural network functions. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the method and compare it with two existing ones.</description>

      <title>Evaluating synthetic fuel production: A case study on the influence of electricity and CO2 price variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To combat climate change, we need to reduce emissions from the transport sector. Synthetic fuels are a long-term solution for aviation, maritime and heavy machinery. Large-scale use requires cost-effectiveness, efficient production and resilience to price changes. In this case study, we simultaneously optimize the cell voltage of the solid oxide electrolysis cell, the heat exchanger network and the heat supply of a PtL-plant. PtL-efficiency and production costs are used as objectives to generate multiple Pareto fronts for future price scenarios. The results show that the sensitivity to price changes has different impacts on design and operating parameters, which can lead to unattractive solution domains in the Pareto front. Currently, synthetic fuels can be produced at 1.83-2.36 EUR/kg. In the best case, at 1.42-1.97 EUR/kg and 3.88-4.28 EUR/kg in the worst case. This paper supports decision-makers in planning PtL-plants to ensure sustainable synthetic fuel availability on a global scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader type algorithm is proposed and analyzed for solving general long-term constrained optimization problems in online manner, where the objective and constraints are arbitrarily generated and not necessarily convex. In each period, random linear perturbation and strongly concave perturbation are incorporated in primal and dual directions, respectively, to the offline oracle, and a global minimax point is searched as the solution. Based on a proposed expected static cumulative regret, we derive the first sublinear $O(T^{8/9})$ regret complexity for this class of problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to tackle a long-term (extreme value) constrained river pollutant source identification problem, validate the theoretical results and exhibit superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds for Many Pivot Rules for the Simplex Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a pivot rule for the simplex method that guarantees a strongly polynomial run-time is a longstanding, fundamental open problem in the theory of linear programming. The leading pivot rule in theory is the shadow pivot rule, which solves a linear program by projecting the feasible region onto a polygon. It has been shown to perform in expected strongly polynomial time on uniformly random instances and in smoothed analysis. In practice, the pivot rule of choice is the steepest edge rule, which normalizes the set of improving neighbors and then chooses a maximally improving normalized neighbor. Exponential lower bounds are known for both rules in worst-case analysis. However, for the shadow simplex method, all exponential examples were only proven for one choice of projection, and for the steepest edge rule, the lower bounds were only proven for the Euclidean norm. In this work, we construct linear programs for which any choice of projection for shadow rule variants will lead to an exponential run-time and exponential examples for any choice of norm for a steepest edge variant.</description>

      <title>Rapid nonlinear convex guidance using a monomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework by which the nonlinear trajectory optimization problem is posed as a path-planning problem in a space liberated of dynamics. In this space, general state constraints for continuous and impulsive control problems are encoded as linear constraints on the native overparameterized variables. This framework is enabled by nonlinear expansion in the vicinity of a reference in terms of fundamental solutions and a minimal nonlinear basis of mixed monomials in problem initial conditions. The former can be computed using state transition tensors, differential algebra, or analytic approaches, and the latter is computed analytically. Nonlinear guidance schemes are proposed taking advantage of this framework, including a successive convex programming scheme for delta-V minimizing trajectory optimization. This work enables a stable, easy to implement, and highly rapid nonlinear guidance implementation without the need for collocation or real-time integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on Gibbs sampling with parallel tempering to solve nonlinear optimal control problems. The algorithm is applicable to nonlinear systems with dynamics that can be approximately represented by a finite dimensional Koopman model, potentially with high dimension. This algorithm exploits linearity of the Koopman representation to achieve significant computational saving for large lifted states. We use a video-game to illustrate the use of the method.</description>

      <title>Provable Acceleration of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method over Heavy Ball Method in Training Over-Parameterized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to its simplicity and efficiency, the first-order gradient method has been extensively employed in training neural networks. Although the optimization problem of the neural network is non-convex, recent research has proved that the first-order method is capable of attaining a global minimum during training over-parameterized neural networks, where the number of parameters is significantly larger than that of training instances. Momentum methods, including the heavy ball (HB) method and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) method, are the workhorse of first-order gradient methods owning to their accelerated convergence. In practice, NAG often exhibits superior performance than HB. However, current theoretical works fail to distinguish their convergence difference in training neural networks. To fill this gap, we consider the training problem of the two-layer ReLU neural network under over-parameterization and random initialization. Leveraging high-resolution dynamical systems and neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, our result not only establishes tighter upper bounds of the convergence rate for both HB and NAG, but also provides the first theoretical guarantee for the acceleration of NAG over HB in training neural networks. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on three benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the routing problem for self-interested vehicles using stochastic decision strategies. By approximating the road latency functions and a non-linear variable transformation, we frame the problem as an aggregative game. We characterize the approximation error and we derive a new monotonicity condition for a broad category of games that encompasses the problem under consideration. Next, we propose a semi-decentralized algorithm to calculate the routing as a variational generalized Nash equilibrium and demonstrate the solution's benefits with numerical simulations. In the particular case of potential games, which emerges for linear latency functions, we explore a receding-horizon formulation of the routing problem, showing asymptotic convergence to destinations and analysing closed-loop performance dependence on horizon length through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Major-Minor Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains difficult to scale to many agents. Recent MARL using Mean Field Control (MFC) provides a tractable and rigorous approach to otherwise difficult cooperative MARL. However, the strict MFC assumption of many independent, weakly-interacting agents is too inflexible in practice. We generalize MFC to instead simultaneously model many similar and few complex agents -- as Major-Minor Mean Field Control (M3FC). Theoretically, we give approximation results for finite agent control, and verify the sufficiency of stationary policies for optimality together with a dynamic programming principle. Algorithmically, we propose Major-Minor Mean Field MARL (M3FMARL) for finite agent systems instead of the limiting system. The algorithm is shown to approximate the policy gradient of the underlying M3FC MDP. Finally, we demonstrate its capabilities experimentally in various scenarios. We observe a strong performance in comparison to state-of-the-art policy gradient MARL methods.</description>

      <title>Correlated Noise Provably Beats Independent Noise for Differentially Private Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private learning algorithms inject noise into the learning process. While the most common private learning algorithm, DP-SGD, adds independent Gaussian noise in each iteration, recent work on matrix factorization mechanisms has shown empirically that introducing correlations in the noise can greatly improve their utility. We characterize the asymptotic learning utility for any choice of the correlation function, giving precise analytical bounds for linear regression and as the solution to a convex program for general convex functions. We show, using these bounds, how correlated noise provably improves upon vanilla DP-SGD as a function of problem parameters such as the effective dimension and condition number. Moreover, our analytical expression for the near-optimal correlation function circumvents the cubic complexity of the semi-definite program used to optimize the noise correlation matrix in previous work. We validate our theory with experiments on private deep learning. Our work matches or outperforms prior work while being efficient both in terms of compute and memory.</description>

      <title>TinyMPC: Model-Predictive Control on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems subject to complex constraints. However, MPC is computationally demanding, and is often impractical to implement on small, resource-constrained robotic platforms. We present TinyMPC, a high-speed MPC solver with a low memory footprint targeting the microcontrollers common on small robots. Our approach is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and leverages the structure of the MPC problem for efficiency. We demonstrate TinyMPC's effectiveness by benchmarking against the state-of-the-art solver OSQP, achieving nearly an order of magnitude speed increase, as well as through hardware experiments on a 27 gram quadrotor, demonstrating high-speed trajectory tracking and dynamic obstacle avoidance. TinyMPC is publicly available at https://tinympc.org.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network-based Block Propagation with Optimal AoI and Reputation in Web 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Web 3.0 is recognized as a pioneering paradigm that empowers users to securely oversee data without reliance on a centralized authority. Blockchains, as a core technology to realize Web 3.0, can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management. Nevertheless, the evolution of blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as ensuring efficiency and reliability to enhance block propagation performance. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of block to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Conjugate-Gradient-like Based Adaptive Moment Estimation Optimization Algorithm for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks is a challenging task. In order to speed up training and enhance the performance of deep neural networks, we rectify the vanilla conjugate gradient as conjugate-gradient-like and incorporate it into the generic Adam, and thus propose a new optimization algorithm named CG-like-Adam for deep learning. Specifically, both the first-order and the second-order moment estimation of generic Adam are replaced by the conjugate-gradient-like. Convergence analysis handles the cases where the exponential moving average coefficient of the first-order moment estimation is constant and the first-order moment estimation is unbiased. Numerical experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm based on the CIFAR10/100 dataset.</description>
