      <title>A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</description>

      <title>Atomic dynamics and local structural disorder during ultrafast melting of polycrystalline Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary distinction between solid and liquid phases is mechanical rigidity, with liquids having a disordered atomic structure that allows flow. While melting is a common phase transition, its microscopic mechanisms still remain unclear. This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ultrafast melting in polycrystalline palladium, focusing on the relationship between atomic dynamics quantified by the root-mean-squared displacement (RMSD) and local structural disorder characterized by the deviation from centrosymmetry. In the crystal bulk, melting is preceded by a gradual rise in the RMSD and local disorder. As the Lindemann limit for the RMSD is approached, the increasing concentration of lattice defects is manifested by a discontinuous rise in disorder. On melting, the rise is followed by a rapid increase in displacement, indicative of atomic flow. In contrast, the grain boundaries undergo melting through a continuous increase of both the displacement and the disorder, resembling a glass transition on heating.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spectral Bias in Neural Operators via High-Frequency Scaling for Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for modeling complex physical problems. However, they suffer from spectral bias making them oblivious to high-frequency modes, which are present in multiscale physical systems. Therefore, they tend to produce over-smoothed solutions, which is particularly problematic in modeling turbulence and for systems with intricate patterns and sharp gradients such as multi-phase flow systems. In this work, we introduce a new approach named high-frequency scaling (HFS) to mitigate spectral bias in convolutional-based neural operators. By integrating HFS with proper variants of UNet neural operators, we demonstrate a higher prediction accuracy by mitigating spectral bias in single and two-phase flow problems. Unlike Fourier-based techniques, HFS is directly applied to the latent space, thus eliminating the computational cost associated with the Fourier transform. Additionally, we investigate alternative spectral bias mitigation through diffusion models conditioned on neural operators. While the diffusion model integrated with the standard neural operator may still suffer from significant errors, these errors are substantially reduced when the diffusion model is integrated with a HFS-enhanced neural operator.</description>

      <title>Grid instability growth rates for explicit, electrostatic momentum- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the Debye length is not resolved in a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation, the plasma will unphysically heat until the Debye length becomes resolved via a phenomenon known as grid heating. The article presents detailed numerical measurements of grid heating for several explicit PIC algorithms including the first systematic (covering the Debye length resolution and drift-velocity parameter space) study of grid-heating growth rates for the standard electrostatic momentum-conserving PIC algorithm. Additionally, we derive and test a cubic-spline-based PIC algorithm that ensures that the interpolated electric field has a continuous first derivative. Also considered are energy-conserving PIC algorithms with linear and quadratic interpolation functions. In all cases, we find that grid heating can occur for for some combinations of Debye under-resolution and plasma drift. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that grid heating cannot be eliminated by using a higher-order field solve, and give an analytical expression for the cold-beam stability limits of some energy-conserving algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Tunnel Junction Based on above-Room-Temperature Altermagnetic CrSb, Ferroelectric In2Se3 and Ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered profound fascination. Their idiosyncratic electronic structures facilitate spintronics and electronics, yet room-temperature (RT) AM-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with versatile tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunneling electroresistance (TER) regulated by multiferroics remain uncharted frontiers. We herein construct an experiment-fabricable above-RT MTJ, comprising altermagnetic metal/ferroelectric barrier/magnetic metal epitomized by CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2. Magnetism- (Ferroelectricity-) manipulatable TER (TMR) and both approaches-controllable spin filtering are attained. Non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and vacuum layer are exploited as counterpoints to discern the roles of ferroelectric and tangible barrier, respectively. High TMR, TER and spin filtering efficiency of 1031/2308 %, 328 % and ~100 % (near-perfect) can be accomplished, respectively. Our results of the initial investigation for above-RT multiferroic AM-based MTJs avail the evolution of advanced spin transport, sensing and logic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Shock with Confidence: Formal Proofs of Correctness for Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) occur ubiquitously throughout computational physics, commonly used in simulations of fluid turbulence, shock waves, electromagnetic interactions, and even general relativistic phenomena. Such equations are often challenging to solve numerically in the non-linear case, due to their tendency to form discontinuities even for smooth initial data, which can cause numerical algorithms to become unstable, violate conservation laws, or converge to physically incorrect solutions. In this paper, we introduce a new formal verification pipeline for such algorithms in Racket, which allows a user to construct a bespoke hyperbolic PDE solver for a specified equation system, generate low-level C code which verifiably implements that solver, and then produce formal proofs of various mathematical and physical correctness properties of the resulting implementation, including L^2 stability, flux conservation, and physical validity. We outline how these correctness proofs are generated, using a custom-built theorem-proving and automatic differentiation framework that fully respects the algebraic structure of floating-point arithmetic, and show how the resulting C code may either be used to run standalone simulations, or integrated into a larger computational multiphysics framework such as Gkeyll.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Integrated Modeling of Thermal Properties and Relaxation Dynamics in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are a promising class of materials celebrated for their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, accurately predicting and understanding the melting temperature (T_m) and glass transition temperature (T_g) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates machine learning (ML) models with theoretical methods to predict and analyze these key thermal properties in metallic glasses. Our ML models using distributional data derived from elemental composition-based features obtain high accuracy while minimizing data preprocessing complexity. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between T_m and T_g to elucidate their dependence on alloy composition and thermodynamic behavior. When the T_g value of metallic glasses is known, further analysis using the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory provides a deeper understanding of structural relaxation dynamics. This integrated framework establishes a quantitative description consistent with experimental data and previous works and paves the way for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials with tailored thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges in Unsupervised Learning: The Case of Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in atomistic simulations, enabling the identification of complex patterns in molecular systems limiting human intervention and bias. However, the practical implementation of these methods presents significant technical challenges, particularly in the selection of hyperparameters and in the physical interpretability of machine-learned descriptors. In this work, we systematically investigate these challenges by applying an unsupervised learning protocol to a fundamental problem in physical chemistry namely, how ions perturb the local structure of water. Using the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions(SOAP) descriptors, we demonstrate how the intrinsic dimension (ID) serves as a guide for selecting hyperparameters and interpreting structural complexity. Furthermore, we construct a high-dimensional free energy landscape encompassing all water environments surrounding different ions. This analysis reveals how the physical properties of ions are intricately reflected in their hydration shells, shaping the landscape through specific connections between different minima. Our findings highlight the difficulty in balancing algorithmic automation with the need of employing both physical and chemical intuition, particularly for the construction of meaningful descriptors and for the interpretation of final results. By critically assessing the methodological hurdles associated with unsupervised learning, we provide a road map for researchers looking to harness these techniques for studying electrolyte and aqueous solutions in general.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Heat Transport in Crystalline Polymers in Real and Reciprocal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transport can be modelled with a variety of approaches in real space (using molecular dynamics) or in reciprocal space (using the Boltzmann transport equation). Employing two conceptually different approaches of each type, we study heat transport in crystalline polyethylene and polythiophene. We find that consistent results can be obtained when using highly efficient and accurate machine-learned potentials, provided that the physical intricacies of the considered materials and methods are correctly accounted for. For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.</description>

      <title>An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14294v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems, with a particular focus on one-dimensional systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.</description>
