      <title>Kappa Entropy and its Thermodynamic Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adopting a bottom-up perspective, we propose a novel two-parametric nonadditive entropy, $S_{\kappa\ell}$, associated with a Kappa-type power-law velocity distribution, $F_{\kappa\ell}(v)$, recently derived in the literature. By formulating an extended Neo-Boltzmannian microstate counting procedure and employing standard averaging techniques, we demonstrate that the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are preserved within this generalized power-law framework only whether $\ell=-5/2$, regardless of the values assumed by the $\kappa$-parameter.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking of Current Response in Disordered Exclusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bias-reversal symmetry -- where reversing an external bias inverts the current without changing its magnitude -- is a hallmark of nonequilibrium transport. While this property holds in homogeneous systems such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process, how disorder and its interplay with particle interactions affect this symmetry has remained unclear. Here, we establish a general criterion showing that the bias-reversal symmetry holds if and only if the local left-right bond-bias ratio is spatially uniform. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal that bond disorder preserves the symmetry beyond linear response, whereas site disorder breaks it through an interplay between heterogeneity and particle interactions. Our results demonstrate how environmental disorder and interparticle interactions cooperate to generate asymmetric transport, thereby providing a unified theoretical framework relevant to transport through biological and artificial nanochannels.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group calculations of partition-function ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of dimensionless quantities defined as ratios of partition functions is analyzed to investigate phase transitions and critical phenomena. At criticality, the universal values of these ratios can be predicted from conformal field theory (CFT) through the modular-invariant partition functions on a torus. We perform numerical calculations using the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group for three two-dimensional models belonging to different universality classes: the Ising model, the three-state Potts model, and the four-state Potts model. The partition-function ratios obey the same finite-size scaling form as the Binder parameter, and their critical values agree well with the universal values predicted by CFT. In the four-state Potts model, we observe logarithmic corrections in the system-size dependence of these ratios.</description>

      <title>Classification of diffusion processes in dimension $d$ via the Carleman approach with applications to models involving additive, multiplicative or square-root noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carleman approach is well-known in the field of deterministic classical dynamics as a method to replace a finite number $d$ of non-linear differential equations by an infinite-dimensional linear system. Here this approach is applied to a system of $d$ stochastic differential equations for $[x_1(t),..,x_d(t)]$ when the forces and the diffusion-matrix elements are polynomials, in order to write the linear system governing the dynamics of the averaged values ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) ... x_d^{n_d}(t) )$ labelled by the $d$ integers $(n_1,..,n_d)$. The natural decomposition of the Carleman matrix into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2+..+n_d$ is useful to identify the models that have the simplest spectral decompositions in the bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. This analysis is then applied to models with a single noise per coordinate, that can be either additive or multiplicative or square-root, or with two types of noises per coordinate, with many examples in dimensions $d=1,2$. In $d=1$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the moments ${\mathbb E} ( x^{n}(t) )$ is diagonal for the Geometric Brownian motion, while it is lower-triangular for the family of Pearson diffusions containing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the Square-Root processes, as well as the Kesten, the Fisher-Snedecor and the Student processes that converge towards steady states with power-law-tails. In dimension $d=2$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the correlations ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) )$ has a natural decomposition into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2$, and we discuss the simplest models where the Carleman matrix is either block-diagonal or block-lower-triangular or block-upper-triangular.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of trail-interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trail interactions occur when past particle trajectories bias future motion, rendering the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. While such systems are abundant in nature, their understanding is limited to the single-particle level or phenomenological mean-field theories. Here, we introduce a minimal model of many trail-interacting particles that extends this paradigm to the fluctuating collective level. Particles diffuse while depositing long-lasting repelling/attracting trails that act as a shared memory field, coupling their dynamics across time and space. Using stochastic density functional theory, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and analyze analytically and numerically the resulting behaviors. We show that memory, coupled with fluctuations, fundamentally reshapes collective dynamics; In the repulsive case, the particle density displays superdiffusive spreading characterized by transient clustering and ballistic motion; In the attractive case, the system condensates in finite time into frozen, localized states. Our results establish general principles for trail-interacting systems and reveal how persistent fields generate novel instabilities and self-organization.</description>

      <title>Classical Thermometry of Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers are emerging as programmable, dynamical experimental platforms for probing strongly correlated spin systems. Yet key thermal assumptions, chiefly a Gibbs-distributed output ensemble, remain unverified in the large-scale regime. Here, we experimentally and quantitatively assess Gibbs sampling fidelity across system sizes spanning over three orders of magnitude. We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.</description>

      <title>Excess work in counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Protected Bipolar Skin Effect and its Topological Breakdown in Disordered Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and disorder remains a central puzzle in open quantum systems. While the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is known to be robust against weak perturbations, its fate under strong disorder, particularly in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is not fully understood. Here, we uncover a Z_2 topological bipolar skin effect in a non-Hermitian Rashba chain, where spin-up and spin-down eigenstates localize at opposite boundaries. By strictly computing the Lyapunov exponents and introducing a biorthogonal spin-separation index, we map the global phase diagram and reveal a hierarchical breakdown of topology. We demonstrate that the Z_2 skin effect is protected against moderate disorder but collapses into a trivial skin phase before the ultimate onset of Anderson localization. Our results establish a distinct regime of disorder-robust topological non-reciprocity, distinguishable from both the trivial bulk limit and the Anderson localized phase.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of the quantum XXZ chain with staggered interactions: Exact results and simulations on digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</description>

      <title>Edge bits in average symmetry protected topological mixed state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.</description>

      <title>Remembrance of Tasks Past in Tunable Physical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential learning in physical networks is hindered by catastrophic forgetting, where training a new task erases solutions to earlier ones. We show that we can significantly enhance memory of previous tasks by introducing a hard threshold in the learning rule, allowing only edges with sufficiently large training signals to be altered. Thresholding confines tuning to the spatial vicinity of inputs and outputs for each task, effectively partitioning the network into weakly overlapping functional regions. Using simulations of tunable resistor networks, we demonstrate that this strategy enables robust memory of multiple sequential tasks while reducing the number of edges and the overall tuning cost. Our results hint at constrained training as a simple, local, and scalable mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting in tunable matter.</description>

      <title>Density of states of quantum systems from free probability theory: a brief overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a brief overview of approaches for calculating the density of states of quantum systems and random matrix Hamiltonians using the tools of free probability theory. For a given Hamiltonian of a quantum system or a generic random matrix Hamiltonian, which can be written as a sum of two non-commutating operators, one can obtain an expression for the density of states of the Hamiltonian from the known density of states of the two component operators by assuming that these operators are mutually free and by using the free additive convolution. In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states. Subsequently, we describe a perturbation scheme that can be developed from the subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform of the density of states and use it to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the density of states in various models, such as the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble and the Anderson model with on-site disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a subclass of a general $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Hamiltonian obeying anti-commutation relation with its conjugate, a Hermitian basis is found that spans the bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors. Using the modified projectors constructed from these eigenvectors, the generalized density matrix of the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric evolution is calculated, and subsequently, ergotropy for a closed system is obtained. The $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system, in an open system scenario, is studied to understand ergotropy under different regimes of non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian. The consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics for the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system in an open system scenario is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Predicting parameters of a model cuprate superconductor using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of calculating phase diagrams for multi-parameter models significantly limits the ability to select parameters that correspond to experimental data. This work presents a machine learning method for solving the inverse problem - forecasting the parameters of a model Hamiltonian for a cuprate superconductor based on its phase diagram. A comparative study of three deep learning architectures was conducted: VGG, ResNet, and U-Net. The latter was adapted for regression tasks and demonstrated the best performance. Training the U-Net model was performed on an extensive dataset of phase diagrams calculated within the mean-field approximation, followed by validation on data obtained using a semi-classical heat bath algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model accurately predicts all considered Hamiltonian parameters, and areas of low prediction accuracy correspond to regions of parametric insensitivity in the phase diagrams. This allows for the extraction of physically interpretable patterns and validation of the significance of parameters for the system. The results confirm the promising potential of applying machine learning to analyze complex physical models in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Testing the Localization Landscape Theory on the Bethe Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Localization Landscape Theory (LLT) provides a classical picture of Anderson localization by introducing an effective confining potential whose percolation is proposed to coincide with the mobility edge. Although this proposal shows remarkable numerical agreement in three dimensions, its fundamental validity remains unsettled. Here we test the LLT analytically on the Bethe lattice, where both the Anderson localization transition and the LLT percolation problem are exactly solvable. We find that the two transitions do not coincide, and their critical behaviors differ markedly. In particular, LLT percolation displays standard mean-field percolation criticality that is fundamentally distinct from the peculiar critical behavior of the Anderson transition on the Bethe lattice. Our results provide an exact benchmark showing that, while geometrically intuitive, the LLT does not capture the true quantum critical properties of localization.</description>

      <title>Target search optimization by threshold resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive- searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>When Heating Isn't Cooling in Reverse: Nos\'e-Hoover Thermostat Fluctuations from Equilibrium Symmetry to Nonequilibrium Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\langle \xi_x \rangle / \langle \xi_y \rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states of Path-structured Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives interaction pathways between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph C*-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger (TCK) algebra, which captures the diversity of path-structured flow connectivity. Equipped with the gauge action, the TCK algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of potential flow pathways within the network. Specifically, the KMS states of this system represent the stationary distributions of a non-Markovian stochastic process with memory decay, capturing how influence propagates along exponentially weighted paths, and yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions. Applied to the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network, our framework reveals that neurolocomotor neurons emerge as the primary hubs of incoming path-structured flow at inverse temperatures where the entropy of KMS states peaks. This finding aligns with experimental evidence of the foundational role of locomotion in {\em C. elegans} behavior, suggesting that functional centrality may arise from the topological embedding of neurons rather than solely from local physiological properties. Our results highlight the potential of algebraic quantum methods and graph algebras to uncover patterns of functional organization in complex systems and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13689v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $T$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $T$ and some other symmetry operation $O$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $O$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>
