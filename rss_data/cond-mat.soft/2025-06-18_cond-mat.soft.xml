      <title>AutoSAS: a new human-aside-the-loop paradigm for automated SAS fitting for high throughput and autonomous experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of artificial-intelligence driven autonomous experiments demands physics-based modeling and decision-making processes, not only to improve the accuracy of the experimental trajectory but also to increase trust by allowing transparent human-machine collaboration. High-quality structural characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray, neutron, or static light scattering) are a particularly relevant example of this need: they provide invaluable information but are challenging to analyze without expert oversight. Here, we introduce AutoSAS, a novel framework for human-aside-the-loop automated data classification. AutoSAS leverages human-defined candidate models, high-throughput combinatorial fitting, and information-theoretic model selection to generate both classification results and quantitative structural descriptors. We implement AutoSAS in an open-source package designed for use with the Autonomous Formulation Laboratory (AFL) for X-ray and neutron scattering-based optimization of multicomponent liquid formulations. In a first application, we leveraged a set of expert defined candidate models to classify, refine the structure, and track transformations in a model injectable drug carrier system. We evaluated four model selection methods and benchmarked them against an optimized machine learning classifier and the best approach was one that balanced quality of the fit and complexity of the model. AutoSAS not only corroborated the critical micelle concentration boundary identified in previous experiments but also discovered a second structural transition boundary not identified by the previous methods. These results demonstrate the potential of AutoSAS to enhance autonomous experimental workflows by providing robust, interpretable model selection, paving the way for more reliable and insightful structural characterization in complex formulations.</description>

      <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polymers in Dilute Solution under Shear and Extensional Flows: A Brownian Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs) are a novel class of polymer structures in which the components are connected by mechanical bonds instead of covalent bonds. We measure the single-molecule rheological properties of polyrotaxanes, daisy chains, and polycatenanes under steady shear and steady uniaxial extension using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions. We obtain key rheological features, including tumbling dynamics, molecular extension, stress, and viscosity. By systematically varying structural features, we demonstrate how MIP topology governs flow response. Compared to linear polymers, all three MIP architectures exhibit enhanced tumbling in shear flow and lower normal stress differences in extensional flow. While polyrotaxanes show higher shear and extensional viscosities, polycatenanes and daisy chains have lower viscosities. In extensional flow, polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes extend earlier than linear polymers. We find that mechanical bonds suppress shear thinning and alter the coil-stretch transition observed in linear polymers. These effects arise from the mechanically bonded rings in MIPs, which expand the polymer profile in gradient direction and increase backbone stiffness due to ring-backbone repulsions. This study provides key insights into MIP flow properties, providing the foundation for their systematic development in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Compositional fluctuations and polymorph selection in crystallization of model soft colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding polymorph selection in atomic and molecular systems and its control through thermodynamic conditions and external factors (such as seed characteristics) is fundamental to the design of targeted materials and holds great significance in materials sciences. In this work, using Monte Carlo simulations on the Gaussian Core Model and Hard-Core Yukawa colloidal systems, we investigated the control of polymorph selection and explored the underlying mechanisms by tuning thermodynamic parameters. We demonstrate that by carefully modifying the free energy landscape to render the globally stable face-centered cubic (FCC) phase metastable with respect to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, the polymorphic identity of particles transitions from FCC-dominated to BCC-dominated via an intermediate regime where both phases nucleate -- either selectively or competitively -- giving rise to a critical-like composition fluctuation of the growing solid-like cluster during the nucleation process. We further probed the critical solid-like cluster compositions, especially in the vicinity of the triple point where the three phases coexist, and observed an interpenetrating arrangement of FCC- and BCC-like particles rather than a commonly observed non-classical core-shell-like two-step nucleation scenario. In addition, we investigated the polymorph selection signatures encoded in local structural fluctuations of the metastable fluid using a machine learning approach based on structural descriptors derived from persistent homology, a topological data analysis method. We believe that the insights gained from this work have the potential to add to the ongoing efforts to control crystallization pathways to obtain the desired functional material.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy delivery with bistable nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Countless biological processes are fueled by energy-rich molecules like ATP and GTP that supply energy with extreme efficiency. However, designing similar energy-delivery schemes from the bottom up, essential for the development of powered nanostructures and other {\it de novo} machinery, presents a significant challenge: how can an energy-rich structure be stable in solution yet still deliver this energy at precisely the right time? In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.</description>

      <title>Random organization criticality with long-range hydrodynamic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven soft athermal systems may display a reversible-irreversible transition between an absorbing, arrested state and an active phase where a steady-state dynamics sets in. A paradigmatic example consists in cyclically sheared suspensions under stroboscopic observation, for which in absence of contacts during a shear cycle particle trajectories are reversible and the stroboscopic dynamics is frozen, while contacts lead to diffusive stroboscopic motion. The Random Organization Model (ROM), which is a minimal model of the transition, shows a transition which falls into the Conserved Directed Percolation (CDP) universality class. However, the ROM ignores hydrodynamic interactions between suspended particles, which make contacts a source of long-range mechanical noise that in turn can create new contacts. Here, we generalize the ROM to include long-range interactions decaying like inverse power laws of the distance. Critical properties continuously depend on the decay exponent when it is smaller than the space dimension. Upon increasing the interaction range, the transition turns convex (that is, with an order parameter exponent $\beta &gt; 1$), fluctuations turn from diverging to vanishing, and hyperuniformity at the transition disappears. We rationalize this critical behavior using a local mean-field model describing how particle contacts are created via mechanical noise, showing that diffusive motion induced by long-range interactions becomes dominant for slowly-decaying interactions.</description>

      <title>Coupling Anisotropic Curvature and Nematic Order: Mechanisms of Membrane Shape Remodeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates how anisotropic curved membrane components (CMCs) control vesicle morphology through curvature sensing, nematic alignment, topological defects, and volume constraints. By comparing arc-shaped and saddle-shaped CMCs, we identify a rich spectrum of steady-state phases. For fully CMC-covered vesicles, arc-shaped components drive a pearling-to-cylinder transition as nematic interactions strengthen, while on partially CMC-covered vesicles, the saddle-shaped CMCs stabilize necks between the convex regions of bare membrane. We map the steady-state shapes of vesicles partially covered by arc-like and saddle-shaped CMCs, exposing how different vesicle shapes depend on the interplay between nematic interactions and volume constraints, revealing several novel phases. By investigating the in-plane nematic field, we find that topological defects consistently localize to high-curvature regions, revealing how intrinsic and deviatoric curvature effects cooperate in membrane remodeling. These findings establish a unified framework for understanding how proteins and lipid domains with anisotropic intrinsic curvature shape cellular structures -- from organelle morphogenesis to global cell shape.</description>

      <title>Cyclically sheared colloidal gels: structural change and delayed failure time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experiments and simulations on cyclically sheared colloidal gels, and probe their behaviour on several different length scales. The shearing induces structural changes in the experimental gel, changing particles' neighborhoods and reorganizing the mesoscopic pores. These results are mirrored in computer simulations of a model gel-former, which show how the material evolves down the energy landscape under shearing, for small strains. By systematic variation of simulation parameters, we characterise the structural and mechanical changes that take place under shear, including both yielding and strain-hardening. We simulate creeping flow under constant shear stress, for gels that were previously subject to cyclic shear, showing that strain-hardening also increases gel stability. This response depends on the orientation of the applied shear stress, revealing that the cyclic shear imprints anisotropic structural features into the gel.</description>

      <title>Coarsening Kinetics in Active Model B+: Macroscale and Microscale Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the coarsening kinetics of active Brownian particles modeled by the {\it Active Model B+} (AMB+). This model was introduced by Tjhung et al. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 8}, 031080 (2018)] and is a generalization of Model B for a conserved order parameter, with two additional activity terms. These terms correspond to rotation-free current (of strength $\lambda$) and rotational current (of strength $\xi$). We find that the presence of rotational current $(\xi \neq 0)$ significantly affects growth kinetics. Depending on the parameter values, AMB+ exhibits either {\it macroscale phase separation} (MPS) or {\it microscale phase separation} ($\mu$PS). We present detailed results for the kinetics of MPS and $\mu$PS in AMB+ with critical composition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion for mass transport phenomena II: Subdiffusion in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a glassy polymer widely used in biomedical engineering, namely in microfluidics applications. However, PDMS is known to interact with hydrophobic chemicals. This interaction is exacerbated at the scale of microfluidics, making careful modeling of in-device concentrations vital for PDMS-based microfluidic devices. While it has been previously reported that many chemicals diffuse through PDMS, here we report that diffusion in PDMS is anomalous, i.e. characterized by nonlinear, subdiffusive mean-squared displacements (MSD). We show that this anomalous diffusion can be modeled in the framework of stretched-time fractional diffusion, and report the transport parameters for a set of fluorescent tracer dyes. Depending on the device geometry and protocol, this anomalous behavior may have a significant impact, specifically in regards to cross-talk between microfluidic channels.</description>

      <title>Mutual effect of charge- and number-density correlations in ionic liquids and concentrated electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions in concentrated ionic systems are studied within the mesoscopic theory at the level of the Gaussian approximation. The previously neglected fluctuation contribution to the inverse charge-charge correlation function is taken into account to verify the accuracy of the previous results. We calculate the correlation lengths and the amplitudes and show that the fluctuation contribution does not lead to significant changes of the results. We also derive necessary conditions for the presence of both, the oscillatory and the monotonic decays of the charge-charge correlations that must be satisfied by the noncoulombic contributions to the inverse charge-charge correlation function. At the level of the Gaussian approximation, these conditions are not satisfied. Extension of the theory beyond the Gaussian approximation is necessary to verify whether the asymptotic decay of the charge-charge correlations is monotonous or oscillatory, as suggested by the surface force apparatus or by the SAXS experiments, respectively.</description>

      <title>Replica RISM molecular solvation theory for electric double layer in nanoporous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of 3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory range from solvation energy of small molecules to phase behavior of polymers and biomolecules. It predicts the molecular mechanisms of chemical and biomolecular systems. Replica RISM-KH-VM molecular solvation theory predicts and explains the structure, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry of electrolyte solutions sorbed in a nanoporous material. It was tested on nanoporous carbon supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte and nanoporous electrosorption cells. The mechanisms in these systems are steered by the electric double layer potential drop across the Stern layer at the nanopores surface and the Gouy-Chapman layer averaged over the nanoporous material, the osmotic term due to the ionic concentrations difference in the two nanoporous electrodes and in the electrolyte solution outside, and the solvation chemical potentials of sorbed ions averaged over the nanoporous material. The latter strongly depends on chemical specificity of ions, solvent, surface functional groups, and steric effects for solvated ions confined in nanopores.</description>

      <title>Liquid-gas state regularities as a manifestation of global isomorphism with the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-gas equilibrium is considered using the global isomorphism with the Ising-like (lattice gas) model. Such an approach assumes the existence of the order parameter in terms of which the symmetry of binodal is restored not only in the vicinity of the critical point (critical isomorphism) but also globally in the whole coexistence region. We show how the empirical law of the rectilinear density diameter of the liquid-gas binodal allows us to derive a rather simple form of the isomorphism transformation between the fluid and lattice gas model of Ising-type. The relations for critical parameters which follow from such isomorphism are tested on a variety of fluid systems, both real and model ones. Moreover, we consider the phase equilibrium in polymer solutions and the Flory $\theta$-point as the extreme state of such equilibrium within our approach. The most crucial testing in 2D case is using the Onsager exact solution of the Ising model, and we represent the results of our approach to the calculation of critical point parameters of monolayers for noble gases and the surface tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density functional approach for classical associating fluids is used to explore the wetting phase diagrams for model systems consisting of water and graphite-like solid surfaces chemically modified by a small amount of grafted chain molecules. The water-like fluid model is adopted from the work of Clark et al. [Mol. Phys., 104, 3561 (2006)]. It very well describes the bulk water vapor-liquid coexistence. Each chain molecule consists of tangentially bonded hard sphere segments. We focus on the investigation of the growth of water film on such complex substrates and exploration of the wetting behavior. For grafted monomers, the prewetting phase diagrams are similar to the diagrams for water on a non-modified solid surface. However, for grafted trimers and pentamers, a physically much richer behavior is observed and analyzed. Trends of the behavior of the wetting temperature and the prewetting critical temperature on the grafting density and water-segments attraction are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Extending the capillary wave model to include the effect of bending rigidity: X-ray reflection and diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface roughness of a thin film at a liquid interface exhibits contributions of thermally excited fluctuations. This thermal roughness depends on temperature (T), surface tension ($\gamma$) and elastic material properties, specifically the bending modulus ($\kappa$) of the film. A non-zero $\kappa$ suppresses the thermal roughness at small length scales compared to an interface with zero $\kappa$, as expressed by the power spectral density (PSD) of the thermal roughness. The description of the X-ray scattering of the standard Capillary Wave Model (CWM), that is valid for zero $\kappa$, is extended to include the effect of $\kappa$. The extended CWM (eCWM) provides a single analytical form for both the specular XRR and the diffuse scattering around the specular reflection, and recovers the expression of the CWM at its zero $\kappa$ limit. This new theoretical approach enables the use of single-shot grazing incidence X-ray off-specular scattering (GIXOS) measurements for characterizing the structure of thin films on a liquid surface. The eCWM analysis approach decouples the thermal roughness factor from the surface scattering signal, providing direct access to the intrinsic surface-normal structure of the film and its bending modulus. Moreover, the eCWM facilitates the calculation of reflectivity at any desired resolution (pseudo XRR approach). The transformation into pseudo XRR provides the benefit of using widely available XRR software to perform GIXOS analysis. The extended range of the vertical scattering vector (Qz) available with the GIXOS-pseudo XRR approach allows for a higher spatial resolution than with conventional XRR. Experimental results are presented for various lipid systems, showing strong agreement between conventional specular XRR and pseudo XRR methods. This agreement validates the proposed approach and highlights its utility for analyzing soft, thin films.</description>

Abstract: Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Droplet non-coalescence has so far been observed in various scenarios, such as during interactions between droplets moving with relative bulk velocity, droplets with opposite charges and size differences, and Leidenfrost droplets due to continuous vapor generation. Although non-coalescence has been reported for droplets of various fluids and sizes, non-coalescence for water droplets has been reported only for grazing collisions of large droplets (diameter &gt;2 mm) moving with high bulk velocity. Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a wide range of droplet diameters, without the presence of any charges, surfactants, fluid property gradients, any additional vapor generation, or bulk droplet velocities. Such non-coalescence manifests in sessile droplet clusters on water repellant surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, they do not necessarily trigger further coalescence with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster. Further, depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, such non-coalescence results in significant lateral momentum generation and consequently, spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9% for most closely packed clusters of 3 droplets and increases further with increase in the number of participating droplets. Further, this phenomenon can manifest for droplets as small as 200 {\mu}m in diameter formed during condensation. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.</description>

      <title>ReLCP: Scalable Complementarity-Based Collision Resolution for Smooth Rigid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complementarity-based collision resolution algorithm for smooth, non-spherical, rigid bodies. Unlike discrete surface representation approaches, which approximate surfaces using discrete elements (e.g., tessellations or sub-spheres) with constraints between nearby faces, edges, nodes, or sub-objects, our algorithm solves a recursively generated linear complementarity problem (ReLCP) to adaptively identify potential collision locations during the collision resolution procedure. Despite adaptively and in contrast to Newton-esque schemes, we prove conditions under which the resulting solution exists and the center of mass translational and rotational dynamics are unique. Our ReLCP also converges to classical LCP-based collision resolution for sufficiently small timesteps. Because increasing the surface resolution in discrete representation methods necessitates subdividing geometry into finer elements -- leading to a super-linear increase in the number of collision constraints -- these approaches scale poorly with increased surface resolution. In contrast, our adaptive ReLCP framework begins with a single constraint per pair of nearby bodies and introduces new constraints only when unconstrained motion would lead to overlap, circumventing the oversampling required by discrete methods. By requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer collision constraints to achieve the same surface resolution, we observe 10-100x speedup in densely packed applications. We validate our ReLCP method against multisphere and single-constraint methods, comparing convergence in a two-ellipsoid collision test, scalability and performance in a compacting ellipsoid suspension and growing bacterial colony, and stability in a taut chainmail network, highlighting our ability to achieve high-fidelity surface representations without suffering from poor scalability or artificial surface roughness.</description>

      <title>Turbulent stretching of dumbbells with hydrodynamic interactions: an analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stretching of an elastic dumbbell in a turbulent flow, with the aim of understanding and quantifying the effect of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between the beads of the dumbbell. Adopting the Batchelor-Kraichnan model for the flow, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation and solve it analytically to obtain the probability distribution of the dumbbell's extension. Using different formulations of the HI tensor, we find that HI preferentially enhances the stretching of stiff dumbbells, i.e., those with a small Weissenberg number. We also evaluate the averaging approximations commonly used to simplify the description of HI effects; the consistently-averaged approximation shows that HI result in a less-pronounced coil-stretch transition in chaotic flows. Finally, we confirm the relevance of our analytical results by a comparison with Brownian dynamics simulations of dumbbells transported in a direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>From Attraction to Repulsion: Emergent Interactions in Harmonically Coupled Active Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic theory of wetting by active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. Our model eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic fidelity, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles is remarkably similar to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions retain all the salient characteristics of equilibrium critical wetting - despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. Additionally, we uncover a ratchet mechanism on permeable barriers in active systems, and demonstrate that this gives rise to steady-state currents and a novel transition pathway in active wetting. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, and precisely demonstrate the connection to equilibrium wetting - while clarifying how differences in microscopic dynamics give rise to novel macroscopic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Active viscoelastic condensates provide controllable mechanical anchor points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.</description>
