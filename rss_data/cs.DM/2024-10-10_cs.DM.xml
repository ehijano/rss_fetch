      <title>Token sliding independent set reconfiguration on block graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an independent set of a simple undirected graph $G$. Suppose that each vertex of $S$ has a token placed on it. The tokens are allowed to be moved, one at a time, by sliding along the edges of $G$, so that after each move, the vertices having tokens always form an independent set of $G$. We would like to determine whether the tokens can be eventually brought to stay on the vertices of another independent set $S'$ of $G$ in this manner. In other words, we would like to decide if we can transform $S$ into $S'$ through a sequence of steps, each of which involves substituting a vertex in the current independent set with one of its neighbours to obtain another independent set. This problem of determining if one independent set of a graph ``is reachable'' from another independent set of it is known to be PSPACE-hard even for split graphs, planar graphs, and graphs of bounded treewidth. Polynomial time algorithms have been obtained for certain graph classes like trees, interval graphs, claw-free graphs, and bipartite permutation graphs. We present a polynomial time algorithm for the problem on block graphs, which are the graphs in which every maximal 2-connected subgraph is a clique. Our algorithm is the first generalization of the known polynomial time algorithm for trees to a larger class of graphs (note that trees form a proper subclass of block graphs).</description>

      <title>Spread blow-up lemma with an application to perturbed random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining ideas of Pham, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin on spread perfect matchings in super-regular bipartite graphs with an algorithmic blow-up lemma, we prove a spread version of the blow-up lemma. Intuitively, this means that there exists a probability measure over copies of a desired spanning graph $H$ in a given system of super-regular pairs which does not heavily pin down any subset of vertices. This allows one to complement the use of the blow-up lemma with the recently resolved Kahn-Kalai conjecture. As an application, we prove an approximate version of a conjecture of B\"ottcher, Parczyk, Sgueglia, and Skokan on the threshold for appearance of powers of Hamilton cycles in perturbed random graphs.</description>

      <title>A Decomposition Approach to the Weighted $k$-server Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A natural variant of the classical online $k$-server problem is the Weighted $k$-server problem, where the cost of moving a server is its weight times the distance through which it moves. Despite its apparent simplicity, the weighted $k$-server problem is extremely poorly understood. Specifically, even on uniform metric spaces, finding the optimum competitive ratio of randomized algorithms remains an open problem -- the best upper bound known is $2^{2^{k+O(1)}}$ due to a deterministic algorithm (Bansal et al., 2018), and the best lower bound known is $\Omega(2^k)$ (Ayyadevara and Chiplunkar, 2021).
  With the aim of closing this exponential gap between the upper and lower bounds, we propose a decomposition approach for designing a randomized algorithm for weighted $k$-server on uniform metrics. Our first contribution includes two relaxed versions of the problem and a technique to obtain an algorithm for weighted $k$-server from algorithms for the two relaxed versions. Specifically, we prove that if there exists an $\alpha_1$-competitive algorithm for one version (which we call Weighted $k$-Server - Service Pattern Construction (W$k$S-SPC) and there exists an $\alpha_2$-competitive algorithm for the other version (which we call Weighted $k$-server - Revealed Service Pattern (W$k$S-RSP)), then there exists an $(\alpha_1\alpha_2)$-competitive algorithm for weighted $k$-server on uniform metric spaces. Our second contribution is a $2^{O(k^2)}$-competitive randomized algorithm for W$k$S-RSP. As a consequence, the task of designing a $2^{poly(k)}$-competitive randomized algorithm for weighted $k$-server on uniform metrics reduces to designing a $2^{poly(k)}$-competitive randomized algorithm for W$k$S-SPC. Finally, we also prove that the $\Omega(2^k)$ lower bound for weighted $k$-server, in fact, holds for W$k$S-RSP.</description>

      <title>A structural description of Zykov and Blanche Descartes graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1949, Zykov proposed the first explicit construction of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number. We define a Zykov graph as any induced subgraph of a graph created using Zykov's construction. We give a structural characterization of Zykov graphs based on a specific type of stable set, that we call splitting stable set. It implies that recognizing this class is NP-complete, while being FPT in the treewidth of the input graph. We provide similar results for the Blanche Descartes construction.</description>

      <title>Gaussian to log-normal transition for independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs, i.e., subsets of vertices where no two are adjacent, have long been studied, for instance as a model of hard-core gas. The $d$-dimensional hypercube, $\{0,1\}^d$, with the nearest neighbor structure, has been a particularly appealing choice for the base graph, owing in part to its many symmetries. Results go back to the work of Korshunov and Sapozhenko who proved sharp results on the count of such sets as well as structure theorems for random samples drawn uniformly. Of much interest is the behavior of such Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In this direction, Kronenberg and Spinka [KS] initiated the study of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube obtained by considering an instance of bond percolation with probability $p$. Relying on tools from statistical mechanics they obtained a detailed understanding of the moments of the partition function, say $\mathcal{Z}$, of the hard-core model on such random graphs and consequently deduced certain fluctuation information, as well as posed a series of interesting questions. In particular, they showed in the uniform case that there is a natural phase transition at $p=2/3$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ transitions from being concentrated for $p&gt;2/3$ to not concentrated at $p=2/3$.
  In this article, developing a probabilistic framework, as well as relying on certain cluster expansion inputs from [KS], we present a detailed picture of both the fluctuations of $\mathcal{Z}$ as well as the geometry of a randomly sampled independent set. In particular, we establish that $\mathcal{Z}$, properly centered and scaled, converges to a standard Gaussian for $p&gt;2/3$, and to a sum of two i.i.d. log-normals at $p=2/3$. A particular step in the proof which could be of independent interest involves a non-uniform birthday problem for which collisions emerge at $p=2/3$.</description>

      <title>Counting overlapping pairs of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A correlation is a binary vector that encodes all possible positions of overlaps of two words, where an overlap for an ordered pair of words (u,v) occurs if a suffix of word u matches a prefix of word v. As multiple pairs can have the same correlation, it is relevant to count how many pairs of words share the same correlation depending on the alphabet size and word length n. We exhibit recurrences to compute the number of such pairs -- which is termed population size -- for any correlation; for this, we exploit a relationship between overlaps of two words and self-overlap of one word. This theorem allows us to compute the number of pairs with a longest overlap of a given length and to show that the expected length of the longest border of two words asymptotically diverges, which solves two open questions raised by Gabric in 2022. Finally, we also provide bounds for the asymptotic of the population ratio of any correlation. Given the importance of word overlaps in areas like word combinatorics, bioinformatics, and digital communication, our results may ease analyses of algorithms for string processing, code design, or genome assembly.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Graph Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Error-Correcting Graph Codes. An error-correcting graph code of distance $\delta$ is a family $C$ of graphs on a common vertex set of size $n$, such that if we start with any graph in $C$, we would have to modify the neighborhoods of at least $\delta n$ vertices in order to obtain some other graph in $C$. This is a natural graph generalization of the standard Hamming distance error-correcting codes for binary strings. Yohananov and Yaakobi were the first to construct codes in this metric, constructing good codes for $\delta &lt; 1/2$, and optimal codes for a large-alphabet analogue. We extend their work by showing
  1. Combinatorial results determining the optimal rate vs. distance trade-off nonconstructively.
  2. Graph code analogues of Reed-Solomon codes and code concatenation, leading to positive distance codes for all rates and positive rate codes for all distances.
  3. Graph code analogues of dual-BCH codes, yielding large codes with distance $\delta = 1-o(1)$. This gives an explicit ''graph code of Ramsey graphs''.
  Several recent works, starting with the paper of Alon, Gujgiczer, K\"orner, Milojevi\'c, and Simonyi, have studied more general graph codes; where the symmetric difference between any two graphs in the code is required to have some desired property. Error-correcting graph codes are a particularly interesting instantiation of this concept.</description>

      <title>Online Matching and Contention Resolution for Edge Arrivals with Vanishing Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of sequential contention resolution and matching algorithms on random graphs with vanishing edge probabilities. When the edges of the graph are processed in an adversarially-chosen order, we derive a new OCRS that is $0.382$-selectable, attaining the "independence benchmark" from the literature under the vanishing edge probabilities assumption. Complementary to this positive result, we show that no OCRS can be more than $0.390$-selectable, significantly improving upon the upper bound of $0.428$ from the literature. We also derive negative results that are specialized to bipartite graphs or subfamilies of OCRS's. Meanwhile, when the edges of the graph are processed in a uniformly random order, we show that the simple greedy contention resolution scheme which accepts all active and feasible edges is $1/2$-selectable. This result is tight due to a known upper bound. Finally, when the algorithm can choose the processing order, we show that a slight tweak to the random order -- give each vertex a random priority and process edges in lexicographic order -- results in a strictly better contention resolution scheme that is $1-\ln(2-1/e)\approx0.510$-selectable. Our positive results also apply to online matching on $1$-uniform random graphs with vanishing (non-identical) edge probabilities, extending and unifying some results from the random graphs literature.</description>

      <title>A Deceptively Simple Quadratic Recurrence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>
