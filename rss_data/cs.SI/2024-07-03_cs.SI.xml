      <title>Supporters and Skeptics: LLM-based Analysis of Engagement with Mental Health (Mis)Information Content on Video-sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over one in five adults in the US lives with a mental illness. In the face of a shortage of mental health professionals and offline resources, online short-form video content has grown to serve as a crucial conduit for disseminating mental health help and resources. However, the ease of content creation and access also contributes to the spread of misinformation, posing risks to accurate diagnosis and treatment. Detecting and understanding engagement with such content is crucial to mitigating their harmful effects on public health. We perform the first quantitative study of the phenomenon using YouTube Shorts and Bitchute as the sites of study. We contribute MentalMisinfo, a novel labeled mental health misinformation (MHMisinfo) dataset of 739 videos (639 from Youtube and 100 from Bitchute) and 135372 comments in total, using an expert-driven annotation schema. We first found that few-shot in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) are effective in detecting MHMisinfo videos. Next, we discover distinct and potentially alarming linguistic patterns in how audiences engage with MHMisinfo videos through commentary on both video-sharing platforms. Across the two platforms, comments could exacerbate prevailing stigma with some groups showing heightened susceptibility to and alignment with MHMisinfo. We discuss technical and public health-driven adaptive solutions to tackling the "epidemic" of mental health misinformation online.</description>

      <title>Regional and Temporal Patterns of Partisan Polarization during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States and Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public health measures were among the most polarizing topics debated online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the discussion surrounded specific events, such as when and which particular interventions came into practise. In this work, we develop and apply an approach to measure subnational and event-driven variation of partisan polarization and explore how these dynamics varied both across and within countries. We apply our measure to a dataset of over 50 million tweets posted during late 2020, a salient period of polarizing discourse in the early phase of the pandemic. In particular, we examine regional variations in both the United States and Canada, focusing on three specific health interventions: lockdowns, masks, and vaccines. We find that more politically conservative regions had higher levels of partisan polarization in both countries, especially in the US where a strong negative correlation exists between regional vaccination rates and degree of polarization in vaccine related discussions. We then analyze the timing, context, and profile of spikes in polarization, linking them to specific events discussed on social media across different regions in both countries. These typically last only a few days in duration, suggesting that online discussions reflect and could even drive changes in public opinion, which in the context of pandemic response impacts public health outcomes across different regions and over time.</description>

      <title>Modelling the mitigation of anti-vaccine opinion propagation to suppress epidemic spread: A computational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information regarding vaccines from sources such as health services, media, and social networks can significantly shape vaccination decisions. In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.</description>

      <title>Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>How Similar Are Elected Politicians and Their Constituents? Quantitative Evidence From Online Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How similar are politicians to those who vote for them? This is a critical question at the heart of democratic representation and particularly relevant at times when political dissatisfaction and populism are on the rise. To answer this question we compare the online discourse of elected politicians and their constituents. We collect a two and a half years (September 2020 - February 2023) constituency-level dataset for USA and UK that includes: (i) the Twitter timelines (5.6 Million tweets) of elected political representatives (595 UK Members of Parliament and 433 USA Representatives), (ii) the Nextdoor posts (21.8 Million posts) of the constituency (98.4% USA and 91.5% UK constituencies). We find that elected politicians tend to be equally similar to their constituents in terms of content and style regardless of whether a constituency elects a right or left-wing politician. The size of the electoral victory and the level of income of a constituency shows a nuanced picture. The narrower the electoral victory, the more similar the style and the more dissimilar the content is. The lower the income of a constituency, the more similar the content is. In terms of style, poorer constituencies tend to have a more similar sentiment and more dissimilar psychological text traits (i.e. measured with LIWC categories).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Access in Networks via Edge Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a model of information flow on that network, a fundamental question is to understand if all the nodes have sufficient access to information generated at other nodes in the graph. If not, we can ask if a small set of edge additions improve information access. Formally, the broadcast value of a network is defined to be the minimum over pairs $u,v \in V$ of the probability that an information cascade starting at $u$ reaches $v$. Recent work in the algorithmic fairness literature has focused on heuristics for adding a few edges to a graph to improve its broadcast. Our goal is to formally study the approximability of the Broadcast Improvement problem: given $G$ and a parameter $k$, find the best set of $k$ edges to add to $G$ in order to maximize the broadcast value of the resulting graph.
  We develop efficient bicriteria approximation algorithms. If the optimal solution adds $k$ edges and achieves a broadcast of $\beta^*$, we develop algorithms that can (a) add $2k-1$ edges and achieve a broadcast value roughly $(\beta^*)^4$, or (b) add $O(k\log n)$ edges and achieve a broadcast roughly $\beta^*$. We also provide other trade-offs, that can be better depending on $k$ and the parameter associated with propagation in the cascade model. We complement our results by proving that unless P = NP, any algorithm that adds $O(k)$ edges must lose significantly in the approximation of $\beta^*$, resolving an open question.
  Our techniques are inspired by connections between Broadcast Improvement and problems such as Metric $k$-Center and Diameter Reduction. However, since the objective involves information cascades, we need to develop novel probabilistic tools to reason about the existence of paths in edge-sampled graphs. Finally, we show that our techniques extend to a single-source variant, for which we show both bicriteria algorithms and inapproximability results.</description>

      <title>WARNING This Contains Misinformation: The Effect of Cognitive Factors, Beliefs, and Personality on Misinformation Warning Tag Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms enhance the propagation of online misinformation by providing large user bases with a quick means to share content. One way to disrupt the rapid dissemination of misinformation at scale is through warning tags, which label content as potentially false or misleading. Past warning tag mitigation studies yield mixed results for diverse audiences, however. We hypothesize that personalizing warning tags to the individual characteristics of their diverse users may enhance mitigation effectiveness. To reach the goal of personalization, we need to understand how people differ and how those differences predict a person's attitudes and self-described behaviors toward tags and tagged content. In this study, we leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 132) and undergraduate students (n = 112) to provide this foundational understanding. Specifically, we find attitudes towards warning tags and self-described behaviors are positively influenced by factors such as Personality Openness and Agreeableness, Need for Cognitive Closure (NFCC), Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) score, and Trust in Medical Scientists. Conversely, Trust in Religious Leaders, Conscientiousness, and political conservatism were negatively correlated with these attitudes and behaviors. We synthesize our results into design insights and a future research agenda for more effective and personalized misinformation warning tags and misinformation mitigation strategies more generally.</description>

      <title>Differential Encoding for Improved Representation Learning over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.</description>

      <title>CogErgLLM: Exploring Large Language Model Systems Design Perspective Using Cognitive Ergonomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating cognitive ergonomics with LLMs is essential for enhancing safety, reliability, and user satisfaction in human-AI interactions. Current LLM design often lacks this integration, leading to systems that may not fully align with human cognitive capabilities and limitations. Insufficient focus on incorporating cognitive science methods exacerbates biases in LLM outputs, while inconsistent application of user-centered design principles results in sub-optimal user experiences. To address these challenges, our position paper explores the critical integration of cognitive ergonomics principles into LLM design, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework and practical guidelines for ethical LLM development. Through our contributions, we seek to advance understanding and practice in integrating cognitive ergonomics into LLM systems, fostering safer, more reliable, and ethically sound human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Protection Adoption Against Networked SIS Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate game-theoretic strategies for containing spreading processes on large-scale networks. Specifically, we consider the class of networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemics where a large population of agents strategically choose whether to adopt partially effective protection. We define the utilities of the agents which depends on the degree of the agent, its individual infection status and action, as well as the the overall prevalence of the epidemic and strategy profile of the entire population. We further present the coupled dynamics of epidemic evolution as well as strategy update which is assumed to follow the replicator dynamics. By relying on timescale separation arguments, we first derive the optimal strategy of protection adoption by the agents for a given epidemic state, and then present the reduced epidemic dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of endemic equilibrium is rigorously characterized and forms the main result of this paper. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to highlight the impacts of heterogeneous node degrees, infection rates, cost of protection adoption, and effectiveness of protection on the epidemic prevalence at the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Cutting through the noise to motivate people: A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 social media posts de/motivating vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in the healthcare information system. The overwhelming volume of misinformation on social media and other socioeconomic factors created extraordinary challenges to motivate people to take proper precautions and get vaccinated. In this context, our work explored a novel direction by analyzing an extensive dataset collected over two years, identifying the topics de/motivating the public about COVID-19 vaccination. We analyzed these topics based on time, geographic location, and political orientation. We noticed that while the motivating topics remain the same over time and geographic location, the demotivating topics rapidly. We also identified that intrinsic motivation, rather than external mandate, is more advantageous to inspire the public. This study addresses scientific communication and public motivation in social media. It can help public health officials, policymakers, and social media platforms develop more effective messaging strategies to cut through the noise of misinformation and educate the public about scientific findings.</description>

      <title>Visual Analytics of Multivariate Networks with Representation Learning and Composite Variable Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate networks are commonly found in real-world data-driven applications. Uncovering and understanding the relations of interest in multivariate networks is not a trivial task. This paper presents a visual analytics workflow for studying multivariate networks to extract associations between different structural and semantic characteristics of the networks (e.g., what are the combinations of attributes largely relating to the density of a social network?). The workflow consists of a neural-network-based learning phase to classify the data based on the chosen input and output attributes, a dimensionality reduction and optimization phase to produce a simplified set of results for examination, and finally an interpreting phase conducted by the user through an interactive visualization interface. A key part of our design is a composite variable construction step that remodels nonlinear features obtained by neural networks into linear features that are intuitive to interpret. We demonstrate the capabilities of this workflow with multiple case studies on networks derived from social media usage and also evaluate the workflow with qualitative feedback from experts.</description>

      <title>Tracking the 2024 US Presidential Election Chatter on Tiktok: A Public Multimodal Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper documents our release of a large-scale data collection of TikTok posts related to the upcoming 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Our current data comprises 1.8 million videos published between November 1, 2023, and May 26, 2024. Its exploratory analysis identifies the most common keywords, hashtags, and bigrams in both Spanish and English posts, focusing on the election and the two main Presidential candidates, President Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
  We utilized the TikTok Research API, incorporating various election-related keywords and hashtags, to capture the full scope of relevant content. To address the limitations of the TikTok Research API, we also employed third-party scrapers to expand our dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/gabbypinto/US2024PresElectionTikToks</description>

      <title>The Gossiping Insert-Eliminate Algorithm for Multi-Agent Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.05452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized multi-agent Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) setup consisting of $N$ agents, solving the same MAB instance to minimize individual cumulative regret. In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip style communications on an arbitrary connected graph. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\Omega(\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.</description>

Abstract: The study of collaborative multi-agent bandits has attracted significant attention recently. In light of this, we initiate the study of a new collaborative setting, consisting of $N$ agents such that each agent is learning one of $M$ stochastic multi-armed bandits to minimize their group cumulative regret. We develop decentralized algorithms which facilitate collaboration between the agents under two scenarios. We characterize the performance of these algorithms by deriving the per agent cumulative regret and group regret upper bounds. We also prove lower bounds for the group regret in this setting, which demonstrates the near-optimal behavior of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multi-topic belief formation through bifurcations over signed social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear dynamic model of continuous-time multi-dimensional belief formation over signed social networks. Our model accounts for the effects of a structured belief system, self-appraisal, internal biases, and various sources of cognitive dissonance posited by recent theories in social psychology. We prove that agents become opinionated as a consequence of a bifurcation. We analyze how the balance of social network effects in the model controls the nature of the bifurcation and, therefore, the belief-forming limit-set solutions. Our analysis provides constructive conditions on how multi-stable network belief equilibria and belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the communication network graph and belief system network graph. Our model and analysis provide new theoretical insights on the dynamics of social systems and a new principled framework for designing decentralized decision-making on engineered networks in the presence of structured relationships among alternatives.</description>

      <title>"There Has To Be a Lot That We're Missing": Moderating AI-Generated Content on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has begun to alter how we work, learn, communicate, and participate in online communities. How might our online communities be changed by generative AI? To start addressing this question, we focused on online community moderators' experiences with AI-generated content (AIGC). We performed fifteen in-depth, semi-structured interviews with community moderators on the social sharing site Reddit to understand their attitudes towards AIGC and how their communities are responding. Our study finds communities are choosing to enact rules restricting use of AIGC for both ideological and practical reasons. We find that, despite the absence of foolproof tools for detecting AIGC, moderators were able to somewhat limit the disruption caused by this new phenomenon by working with their communities to clarify norms about AIGC use. However, moderators found enforcing AIGC restrictions challenging, and had to rely on time-intensive and inaccurate detection heuristics in their efforts. Our results highlight the importance of supporting community autonomy and self-determination in the face of this sudden technological change, and suggest potential design solutions that may help.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate and revise text with human-level performance, and have been widely commercialized in systems like ChatGPT. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. We show that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>GraphSnapShot: Graph Machine Learning Acceleration with Fast Storage and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>
