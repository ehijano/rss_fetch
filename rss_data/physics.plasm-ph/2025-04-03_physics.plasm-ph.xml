      <title>An Improved Boris Algorithm for Charged Particle Dynamics in Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Improved Boris algorithm for simulating charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields has been derived. It addresses the issue of inaccurate fast-scale cyclotron phase calculations in the original Boris algorithm, while still maintaining its advantage in simulating slow-scale guiding center motion, hence achieves a balance between low and high-frequency dynamics, overcoming the limitation of traditional second-order volume-preserving algorithms(VPAs) that are constrained to a single characteristic frequency. Test particle simulations indicate that, in most cases, the improved Boris algorithm achieves an exceedingly higher accuracy than conventional VPAs when simulating cases involving various frequencies of electric field within a typical Tokamak magnetic field, highlighting its superior efficacy in handling problems over a large range of characteristic frequencies.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model of jet-corona coupling in accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) accretion disks are often coupled to ultramagnetized and tenuous plasma coronae close to their central BHs. The coronal magnetic field can exchange energy between the disk and the BH, power X-ray emission, and lead to jetted outflows. Up until now, the coronal physics of BH accretion has only been studied using fluid modeling. We construct the first model of a BH feeding on a zero-net-flux accretion disk corona based on kinetic plasma physics. This allows us to self-consistently capture how collisionless relativistic magnetic reconnection regulates the coronal dynamics. We present global, axisymmetric, general relativistic particle-in-cell simulation of a BH coupled, via a series of magnetic loops, to a razor-thin accretion disk. We target the jet-launching regime where the loops are much larger than the BH. We ray-trace high-energy synchrotron lightcurves and track the flow of Poynting flux through the system, including along specific field-line bundles. Reconnection on field lines coupling the BH to the disk dominates the synchrotron output, regulates the flux threading the BH, and ultimately untethers magnetic loops from the disk, ejecting them via a magnetically striped Blandford-Znajek jet. The jet is initially Poynting-dominated, but reconnection operates at all radii, depleting the Poynting power logarithmically in radius. Coronal emission and jet launch are linked through reconnection in our model. This link might explain coincident X-ray flaring and radio-jet ejections observed during hard-to-soft X-ray binary state transitions. It also suggests that striped jet launch could be heralded by a bright coronal counterpart. Our synchrotron signatures resemble variability observed from the peculiar changing-look AGN, 1ES 1927+654, and from Sagittarius A*, hinting that processes similar to our model may be at work in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Radiative relativistic turbulence as an in situ pair-plasma source in blazar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As powerful gamma-ray engines, blazars -- relativistic plasma jets launched toward Earth from active galactic nuclei -- are manifestly high-energy particle accelerators. Yet, exactly how these jets accelerate particles as well as what they are made of both remain largely mysterious. In this work, we argue that these issues may be linked through the gamma-ray emission for which blazars are renowned. Namely, high-energy photons produced at sites of intense particle acceleration could be absorbed by soft radiation within the jet, enriching it with electron-positron pairs. We explore this possibility in the specific context of particle acceleration by magnetized radiative relativistic turbulence. Using a combination of theory, particle-in-cell simulations, and Fokker-Planck modeling, we identify and characterize a novel pair-production-mediated equilibration mechanism in such turbulence. Initially, turbulent energy injection outpaces radiative cooling, leading to runaway particle acceleration and gamma-ray radiation. Then, gamma-ray absorption begets copious newborn pairs, slowing subsequent particle acceleration. This eventually brings particle acceleration into balance with radiative cooling and shuts down pair production: a pair-enriched final equilibrium. We estimate that this process could significantly load jets of flat-spectrum radio quasars with fresh pairs. These results represent an important connection between particle acceleration and plasma composition in blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Guiding-centre Lagrangian and quasi-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding-centre approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a 'quasi-symmetry' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well-established subject.</description>

      <title>Probing the radiation-dominated regime of laser-plasma interaction in multi-beam configurations of petawatt lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model numerically the ultrarelativistic dynamics of a dense plasma microtarget in a focus of several intersecting femtosecond laser pulses of multi-petawatt power each. The aim is to examine perspective future experimental approaches to the search of the Inverse Faraday Effect induced by radiation friction. We show that multi-beam configurations allow lowering the single beam peak laser power required to generate a detectable quasi-static longitudinal magnetic field excited due to the radiation reaction force. The effect is significant at angles around $10^{\rm o}$ between the beam propagation axes, almost vanishes when the angle exceeds $20^{\rm o}$, and remains rather stable with respect to variations of relative phases and amplitudes of the beams. Quantum recoil accounted within semi-classical approach is shown to considerably suppress the longitudinal magnetic field, which however remains sizable. We conclude that using four infrared femtosecond linearly polarized pulses, 15 petawatt power each, crossing at angles $\approx 10^{\rm o}$, the radiation-dominated regime of laser-plasma interaction can be experimentally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Semantic Information Management in Low-Temperature Plasma Science and Technology with VIVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital research data management is increasingly integrated across universities and research institutions, addressing the handling of research data throughout its lifecycle according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Recent emphasis on the semantic and interlinking aspects of research data, e.g., by using ontologies and knowledge graphs further enhances findability and reusability. This work presents a framework for creating and maintaining a knowledge graph specifically for low-temperature plasma (LTP) science and technology. The framework leverages a domain-specific ontology called Plasma-O, along with the VIVO software as a platform for semantic information management in LTP research. While some research fields are already prepared to use ontologies and knowledge graphs for information management, their application in LTP research is nascent. This work aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that not only improves research data management but also fosters community participation in building the domain-specific ontology and knowledge graph based on the published materials. The results may also support other research fields in the practical use of knowledge graphs for semantic information management.</description>

      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HCl, using two consecutive UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the acceleration lasers. We show how elastic collisions define number density $n$ and polarization P regimes ($10^{16}\leq$ $n$ $\leq 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, 0.99 $\geq$ P $\geq$ 0.40) for the pre-polarized targets, and use particle-in-cell simulations to demonstrate the method's feasibility.</description>

      <title>High Energy Emission from the Intrabinary Shocks in Redback Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrabinary shocks (IBS) of spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. In redback spider pulsars, the IBS typically wraps around the pulsar, leading to a near-normal IBS shock with relatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of radiating particles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral features in the hard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses of three redback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new J2215 NuSTAR data. We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a marginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in J2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to estimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\rm IBS} \sim 40-100$ G and place lower bounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the magnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres.</description>
