      <title>Decoding Fatigue Levels of Pilots Using EEG Signals with Hybrid Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of pilots' mental states is critical, as abnormal mental states have the potential to cause catastrophic accidents. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning techniques to classify different fatigue levels, specifically a normal state, low fatigue, and high fatigue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to classify fatigue levels in pilots. Our approach employs the hybrid deep neural network comprising five convolutional blocks and one long short-term memory block to extract the significant features from electroencephalography signals. Ten pilots participated in the experiment, which was conducted in a simulated flight environment. Compared to four conventional models, our proposed model achieved a superior grand-average accuracy of 0.8801, outperforming other models by at least 0.0599 in classifying fatigue levels. In addition to successfully classifying fatigue levels, our model provided valuable feedback to subjects. Therefore, we anticipate that our study will make the significant contributions to the advancement of autonomous flight and driving technologies, leveraging artificial intelligence in the future.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection via Dynamic Graph-based Attention Block in MI-based EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct interaction between humans and computers by analyzing brain signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the non-invasive tools used in BCI systems, providing high temporal resolution for real-time applications. However, EEG signals are often affected by a low signal-to-noise ratio, physiological artifacts, and individual variability, representing challenges in extracting distinct features. Also, motor imagery (MI)-based EEG signals could contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics, which might cause the weights of the deep model to become biased towards those features. To address these problems, we proposed the end-to-end deep preprocessing method that effectively enhances MI characteristics while attenuating features with low correlation to MI characteristics. The proposed method consisted of the temporal, spatial, graph, and similarity blocks to preprocess MI-based EEG signals, aiming to extract more discriminative features and improve the robustness. We evaluated the proposed method using the public dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV to compare the performances when integrating the proposed method into the conventional models, including the DeepConvNet, the M-ShallowConvNet, and the EEGNet. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve the improved performances and lead to more clustered feature distributions of MI tasks. Hence, we demonstrated that our proposed method could enhance discriminative features related to MI characteristics.</description>

      <title>Virtual Array for Dual Function MIMO Radar Communication Systems using OTFS Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A MIMO dual-function radar communication (DFRC) system transmitting orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms is considered. A key advantage of MIMO radar is its ability to create a virtual array, achieving higher sensing resolution than the physical receive array. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct a virtual array for the system under consideration. The transmit antennas can use the Doppler-delay (DD) domain bins in a shared fashion. A number of Time-Frequency (TF) bins, referred to as private bins, are exclusively assigned to specific transmit antennas. The TF signals received on the private bins are orthogonal and thus can be used to synthesize a virtual array, which, combined with coarse knowledge of radar parameters (i.e., angle, range, and velocity), enables high-resolution estimation of those parameters. The introduction of $N_p$ private bins necessitates a reduction in DD domain symbols, thereby reducing the data rate of each transmit antenna by $N_p-1$. However, even a small number of private bins is sufficient to achieve significant sensing gains with minimal communication rate loss.</description>

      <title>Can EEG resting state data benefit data-driven approaches for motor-imagery decoding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resting-state EEG data in neuroscience research serve as reliable markers for user identification and reveal individual-specific traits. Despite this, the use of resting-state data in EEG classification models is limited. In this work, we propose a feature concatenation approach to enhance decoding models' generalization by integrating resting-state EEG, aiming to improve motor imagery BCI performance and develop a user-generalized model. Using feature concatenation, we combine the EEGNet model, a standard convolutional neural network for EEG signal classification, with functional connectivity measures derived from resting-state EEG data. The findings suggest that although grounded in neuroscience with data-driven learning, the concatenation approach has limited benefits for generalizing models in within-user and across-user scenarios. While an improvement in mean accuracy for within-user scenarios is observed on two datasets, concatenation doesn't benefit across-user scenarios when compared with random data concatenation. The findings indicate the necessity of further investigation on the model interpretability and the effect of random data concatenation on model robustness.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Radio Pre-training: Toward Foundational Models for Spectrogram Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational deep learning (DL) models are general models, trained on large, diverse, and unlabelled datasets, typically using self-supervised learning techniques have led to significant advancements especially in natural language processing. These pretrained models can be fine-tuned for related downstream tasks, offering faster development and reduced training costs, while often achieving improved performance. In this work, we introduce Masked Spectrogram Modeling, a novel self-supervised learning approach for pretraining foundational DL models on radio signals. Adopting a Convolutional LSTM architecture for efficient spatio-temporal processing, we pretrain the model with an unlabelled radio dataset collected from over-the-air measurements. Subsequently, the pretrained model is fine-tuned for two downstream tasks: spectrum forecasting and segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our methodology achieves competitive performance in both forecasting accuracy and segmentation, validating its effectiveness for developing foundational radio models.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation: Full Diversity Condition, Performance Analysis, and Low-Complexity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a novel modulation technique based on chirp signals that has been recently proposed as an effective solution for highly reliable communications in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the design of robust index modulation (IM) schemes under the multiple-antenna AFDM transmission framework. To this end, the cyclic delay diversity (CDD) technique is employed to harvest the transmit diversity gain. As a result, we propose two novel AFDM-IM schemes with transmit diversity, termed as CDD-AFDM-IM-I and CDD-AFDM-IM-II. We analyze the full diversity conditions and parameter settings of the proposed CDD-AFDM-IM schemes for both integer and fractional Doppler cases over linear time-varying (LTV) channels. Moreover, we prove that IM enables AFDM to have stronger diversity protection when the full diversity condition is not satisfied. Asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection are derived in closed-form. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity double-layer message passing (DLMP) algorithm for practical large-dimensional signal detection in the proposed CDD-AFDM-IM systems. Comparison with existing detections shows that the proposed DLMP algorithm achieves a better tradeoff between the BER performance and the computational complexity. Finally, BER simulation results confirm that our proposed CDD-AFDM-IM schemes with both the ML and DLMP detections outperform the benchmark schemes over the LTV channels.</description>

      <title>A reconfigurable non-linear active metasurface for coherent wave down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces can manipulate the amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves, offering applications ranging from antenna design and cloaking to imaging and communication. Additionally, temporal, and non-linear metasurfaces have the potential to adjust the frequency of impinging waves, driving advancements in frequency conversion, sensing, and quantum systems. Here, we report the demonstration of a non-linear active electronic-photonic metasurface that transfers information from an impinging optical wave to a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) beam. The proof-of-concept metasurface is designed to radiate a steerable 28GHz beam when illuminated with an optical wave at 193THz and consists of optically synchronized electronic-photonic chips tiled on a printed circuit board containing a microstrip patch antenna array. Input light, modulated with a data-encoded mm-wave carrier, is coupled into electronic-photonic chips using microlenses. Within each chip, the mm-wave signal is detected, phase-adjusted, amplified, and routed to an off-chip antenna. Beam-steering over a range of 60$^{\circ}$ in elevation and azimuth and data transmission at 2Gb/s over a fiber-wireless link is demonstrated. Free-space optical synchronization can significantly reduce the complexity of large-scale metasurfaces composed of non-uniform or randomly placed elements, is compatible with scalable architectures, and facilitates data transfer and mm-wave beam shaping, allowing for large-scale high-bandwidth and energy-efficient links with reduced complexity for the next generation communication, computation, sensing and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Building 6G Radio Foundation Models with Transformer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation deep learning (DL) models are general models, designed to learn general, robust and adaptable representations of their target modality, enabling finetuning across a range of downstream tasks. These models are pretrained on large, unlabeled datasets using self-supervised learning (SSL). Foundation models have demonstrated better generalization than traditional supervised approaches, a critical requirement for wireless communications where the dynamic environment demands model adaptability. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as a radio foundation model for spectrogram learning. We introduce a Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM) approach to pretrain the ViT in a self-supervised fashion. We evaluate the ViT-based foundation model on two downstream tasks: Channel State Information (CSI)-based Human Activity sensing and Spectrogram Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance to supervised training while generalizing across diverse domains. Notably, the pretrained ViT model outperforms a four-times larger model that is trained from scratch on the spectrogram segmentation task, while requiring significantly less training time, and achieves competitive performance on the CSI-based human activity sensing task. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of ViT with MSM for pretraining as a promising technique for scalable foundation model development in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Holographic MIMO for Next Generation Non-Terrestrial Networks: Motivation, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the integration of the Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) as a transformative solution for next generation Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), addressing key challenges, such as high hardware costs, launch expenses, and energy inefficiency. Traditional NTNs are constrained by the financial and operational limitations posed by bulky, costly antenna systems, alongside the complexities of maintaining effective communications in space. HMIMO offers a novel approach utilizing compact and lightweight arrays of densely packed radiating elements with real-time reconfiguration capabilities, thus, capable of optimizing system performance under dynamic conditions such as varying orbital dynamics and Doppler shifts. By replacing conventional antenna systems with HMIMO, the complexity and cost of satellite manufacturing and launch can be substantially reduced, enabling more streamlined and cost-effective satellite designs. This advancement holds significant potential to democratize space communications, making them accessible to a broader range of stakeholders, including smaller nations and commercial enterprises. Moreover, the inherent capabilities of HMIMO in enhancing energy efficiency, scalability, and adaptability position this technology as a key enabler of new use cases and sustainable satellite operations.</description>

      <title>A Random Process Model Useful for Describing Radar Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the theory of Bernstein functions, completely monotonic functions, and Levy processes to define a positive random process $\tau(t)$. For radar clutter one may think of $\tau(t)$ as the instantaneous power of the scattered radar signal that is described by a compound-Gaussian model. Thus the results herein give a mechanism for defining and simulating a compound-Gaussian random process that can be used in various radar studies. We give several examples of the sample paths of this process.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Algebra Framework for a Multidimensional Analytic Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the problem of extending the one-dimensional analytic signal, which is ubiquitous throughout signal processing, to higher dimensional signals. Bulow et al. and Felsberg et al. have previously used techniques from Clifford algebra and analysis to extend the one-dimensional analytic signal to higher dimensions. However, each author sets forth a different definition of a multidimensional analytic signal. Herein we follow an observation of Brackx et al. and adopt a general definition of an analytic signal that encompasses both the hypercomplex signal of Bulow et al. and the monogenic signal of Felsberg et al. within the same mathematical framework. The crux of our approach is captured by the following statement: A multidimensional analytic signal is generated by an idempotent. We develop this notion more specifically using examples from geometric algebra.</description>

      <title>SpecPCM: A Low-power PCM-based In-Memory Computing Accelerator for Full-stack Mass Spectrometry Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) is essential for proteomics and metabolomics but faces impending challenges in efficiently processing the vast volumes of data. This paper introduces SpecPCM, an in-memory computing (IMC) accelerator designed to achieve substantial improvements in energy and delay efficiency for both MS spectral clustering and database (DB) search. SpecPCM employs analog processing with low-voltage swing and utilizes recently introduced phase change memory (PCM) devices based on superlattice materials, optimized for low-voltage and low-power programming. Our approach integrates contributions across multiple levels: application, algorithm, circuit, device, and instruction sets. We leverage a robust hyperdimensional computing (HD) algorithm with a novel dimension-packing method and develop specialized hardware for the end-to-end MS pipeline to overcome the non-ideal behavior of PCM devices. We further optimize multi-level PCM devices for different tasks by using different materials. We also perform a comprehensive design exploration to improve energy and delay efficiency while maintaining accuracy, exploring various combinations of hardware and software parameters controlled by the instruction set architecture (ISA). SpecPCM, with up to three bits per cell, achieves speedups of up to 82x and 143x for MS clustering and DB search tasks, respectively, along with a four-orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art CPU/GPU tools.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions with Structured Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of signal processing, phase transition phenomena have recently attracted great attention. Donoho's work established the signal recovery threshold using indicators such as restricted isotropy (RIP) and incoherence and proved that phase transition phenomena occur in compressed sampling. Nevertheless, the phase transition phenomenon of structured sparse signals remains unclear, and these studies mainly focused on simple sparse signals. Signals with a specific structure, such as the block or tree structures common in real-world applications, are called structured sparse signals. The objectives of this article are to study the phase transition phenomenon of structured sparse signals and to investigate how structured sparse signals affect the phase transition threshold. It begins with a summary of the common subspace of structured sparse signals and the theory of high-dimensional convex polytope random projections. Next, the strong threshold expression of block-structured and tree-structured sparse signals is derived after examining the weak and strong thresholds of structured sparse signals.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence System for Automated EEG Background Analysis and Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. However, small hospitals and clinics often lack advanced EEG signal analysis systems and are prone to misinterpretation in manual EEG reading. This study proposes an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system for automatic interpretation of EEG background activity and report generation. The system combines deep learning models for posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) prediction, unsupervised artifact removal, and expert-designed algorithms for abnormality detection. For PDR prediction, 1530 labeled EEGs were used, and the best ensemble model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.237, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.359, an accuracy of 91.8% within a 0.6Hz error, and an accuracy of 99% within a 1.2Hz error. The AI system significantly outperformed neurologists in detecting generalized background slowing (p = 0.02; F1: AI 0.93, neurologists 0.82) and demonstrated improved focal abnormality detection, although not statistically significant (p = 0.79; F1: AI 0.71, neurologists 0.55). Validation on both an internal dataset and the Temple University Abnormal EEG Corpus showed consistent performance (F1: 0.884 and 0.835, respectively; p = 0.66), demonstrating generalizability. The use of large language models (LLMs) for report generation demonstrated 100% accuracy, verified by three other independent LLMs. This hybrid AI system provides an easily scalable and accurate solution for EEG interpretation in resource-limited settings, assisting neurologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing misdiagnosis rates.</description>

      <title>Trading Datarate for Latency in Quantum Communication</title>

Abstract: Low latency and high data rate performance are essential in wireless communication systems. This paper explores trade-offs between latency and data rates for optical wireless communication. We introduce a latency-optimized model utilizing compound codes as one corner case and a data rate-optimized model employing channel estimation via pilot signals and feedback before data transmission. Trade-offs between the two extremes are displayed. Most importantly, we detail operating points that can only be reached when the receiver side of the link employs optimal quantum measurement strategies. Furthermore, we propose an IoT application in a robot factory as an example scenario. Our findings reveal a trade-off between latency and data rate driven by two basic algorithms: compound codes reduce latency at the cost of data rates, while channel estimation enhances data rates at the cost of latency.</description>

Abstract: Modern cryptography, such as Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), has been designed by humans based on our understanding of cryptographic methods. Neural Network (NN) based cryptography is being investigated due to its ability to learn and implement random cryptographic schemes that may be harder to decipher than human-designed algorithms. NN based cryptography may create a new cryptographic scheme that is NN specific and that changes every time the NN is (re)trained. This is attractive since it would require an adversary to restart its process(es) to learn or break the cryptographic scheme every time the NN is (re)trained. Current challenges facing NN-based encryption include additional communication overhead due to encoding to correct bit errors, quantizing the continuous-valued output of the NN, and enabling One-Time-Pad encryption. With this in mind, the Random Adversarial Data Obfuscation Model (RANDOM) Adversarial Neural Cryptography (ANC) network is introduced. RANDOM is comprised of three new NN layers: the (i) projection layer, (ii) inverse projection layer, and (iii) dot-product layer. This results in an ANC network that (i) is computationally efficient, (ii) ensures the encrypted message is unique to the encryption key, and (iii) does not induce any communication overhead. RANDOM only requires around 100 KB to store and can provide up to 2.5 megabytes per second of end-to-end encrypted communication.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency Task-Oriented Communications with Multi-Round, Multi-Task Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address task-oriented (or goal-oriented) communications where an encoder at the transmitter learns compressed latent representations of data, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder performs a machine learning task, specifically for classifying the received signals. The deep neural networks corresponding to the encoder-decoder pair are jointly trained, taking both channel and data characteristics into account. Our objective is to achieve high accuracy in completing the underlying task while minimizing the number of channel uses determined by the encoder's output size. To this end, we propose a multi-round, multi-task learning (MRMTL) approach for the dynamic update of channel uses in multi-round transmissions. The transmitter incrementally sends an increasing number of encoded samples over the channel based on the feedback from the receiver, and the receiver utilizes the signals from a previous round to enhance the task performance, rather than only considering the latest transmission. This approach employs multi-task learning to jointly optimize accuracy across varying number of channel uses, treating each configuration as a distinct task. By evaluating the confidence of the receiver in task decisions, MRMTL decides on whether to allocate additional channel uses in multiple rounds. We characterize both the accuracy and the delay (total number of channel uses) of MRMTL, demonstrating that it achieves the accuracy close to that of conventional methods requiring large numbers of channel uses, but with reduced delay by incorporating signals from a prior round. We consider the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural network architectures, and AWGN and Rayleigh channel models for performance evaluation. We show that MRMTL significantly improves the efficiency of task-oriented communications, balancing accuracy and latency effectively.</description>

      <title>Private Counterfactual Retrieval With Immutable Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a classification task, counterfactual explanations provide the minimum change needed for an input to be classified into a favorable class. We consider the problem of privately retrieving the exact closest counterfactual from a database of accepted samples while enforcing that certain features of the input sample cannot be changed, i.e., they are \emph{immutable}. An applicant (user) whose feature vector is rejected by a machine learning model wants to retrieve the sample closest to them in the database without altering a private subset of their features, which constitutes the immutable set. While doing this, the user should keep their feature vector, immutable set and the resulting counterfactual index information-theoretically private from the institution. We refer to this as immutable private counterfactual retrieval (I-PCR) problem which generalizes PCR to a more practical setting. In this paper, we propose two I-PCR schemes by leveraging techniques from private information retrieval (PIR) and characterize their communication costs. Further, we quantify the information that the user learns about the database and compare it for the proposed schemes.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the positioning of the pilot symbols, as well as the power distribution between the pilot and the communication symbols in the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. We analyze the pilot placements that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in estimating the channel taps. This allows us to identify two new pilot allocations for OTFS. In addition, we optimize the average channel capacity by adjusting the power balance. We show that this leads to a significant increase in average capacity. The results provide valuable guidance for designing the OTFS parameters to achieve maximum capacity. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07797v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified AI Models for MU-MIMO Communications: A Tensor Equivariance Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified framework based on equivariance for the design of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. We first provide definitions of multidimensional equivariance, high-order equivariance, and multidimensional invariance (referred to collectively as tensor equivariance). On this basis, by investigating the design of precoding and user scheduling, which are key techniques in MU-MIMO systems, we delve deeper into revealing tensor equivariance of the mappings from channel information to optimal precoding tensors, precoding auxiliary tensors, and scheduling indicators, respectively. To model mappings with tensor equivariance, we propose a series of plug-and-play tensor equivariant neural network (TENN) modules, where the computation involving intricate parameter sharing patterns is transformed into concise tensor operations. Building upon TENN modules, we propose the unified tensor equivariance framework that can be applicable to various communication tasks, based on which we easily accomplish the design of corresponding AI-assisted precoding and user scheduling schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the constructed precoding and user scheduling methods achieve near-optimal performance while exhibiting significantly lower computational complexity and generalization to inputs with varying sizes across multiple dimensions. This validates the superiority of TENN modules and the unified framework.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a Full Duplex (FD) eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) node equipped with reconfigurable metasurface antennas at its transmission and reception sides is considered, which is optimized for simultaneous multi-user communications and sensing in the near-field regime at THz frequencies. We first present a novel Position Error Bound (PEB) analysis for the spatial parameters of multiple targets in the vicinity of the FD node, via the received backscattered data signals, and devise an optimization framework for its metasurface-based precoder and combiner. Then, we formulate and solve an optimization problem aiming at the downlink sum-rate maximization, while simultaneously ensuring a minimum PEB requirement for targets' localization. Our simulation results for a sub-THz system setup validate the joint near-field communications and sensing capability of the proposed FD XL MIMO scheme with metasurfaces antennas, showcasing the interplay of its various design parameters.</description>

Abstract: This work considers the problem of enabling maximum multipath diversity of orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM)-based systems. We define and study an Affine OCDM (A-OCDM) system in which a chirp parameter is adapted to enable maximum diversity offered by frequency selective channels. Our proposed system also reduces implementation complexity by eliminating the need for precoding, compared to linear constellation precoded OCDM. Corroborating simulations are provided to show that A-OCDM also preserves OCDM systems' resilience against interference offered by spreading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, an innovative communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering feedback channel coding strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Boosted Neural Decoders: Achieving Extreme Reliability of LDPC Codes for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring extremely high reliability in channel coding is essential for 6G networks. The next-generation of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) scenario within 6G networks requires frame error rate (FER) below $10^{-9}$. However, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, the standard in 5G new radio (NR), encounter a challenge known as the error floor phenomenon, which hinders to achieve such low rates. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative solution: boosted neural min-sum (NMS) decoder. This decoder operates identically to conventional NMS decoders, but is trained by novel training methods including: i) boosting learning with uncorrected vectors, ii) block-wise training schedule to address the vanishing gradient issue, iii) dynamic weight sharing to minimize the number of trainable weights, iv) transfer learning to reduce the required sample count, and v) data augmentation to expedite the sampling process. Leveraging these training strategies, the boosted NMS decoder achieves the state-of-the art performance in reducing the error floor as well as superior waterfall performance. Remarkably, we fulfill the 6G xURLLC requirement for 5G LDPC codes without a severe error floor. Additionally, the boosted NMS decoder, once its weights are trained, can perform decoding without additional modules, making it highly practical for immediate application. The source code is available at https://github.com/ghy1228/LDPC_Error_Floor.</description>

      <title>OTFS-MDMA: An Elastic Multi-Domain Resource Utilization Mechanism for High Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By harnessing the delay-Doppler (DD) resource domain, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) substantially improves the communication performance under high-mobility scenarios by maintaining quasi-time-invariant channel characteristics. However, conventional multiple access (MA) techniques fail to efficiently support OTFS in the face of diverse communication requirements. Recently, multi-dimensional MA (MDMA) has emerged as a flexible channel access technique by elastically exploiting multi-domain resources for tailored service provision. Therefore, we conceive an elastic multi-domain resource utilization mechanism for a novel multi-user OTFS-MDMA system by leveraging user-specific channel characteristics across the DD, power, and spatial resource domains. Specifically, we divide all DD resource bins into separate subregions called DD resource slots (RSs), each of which supports a fraction of users, thus reducing the multi-user interference. Then, the most suitable MA, including orthogonal, non-orthogonal, or spatial division MA (OMA/ NOMA/ SDMA), will be selected with each RS based on the interference levels in the power and spatial domains, thus enhancing the spectrum efficiency. Then, we jointly optimize the user assignment, access scheme selection, and power allocation in all DD RSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate subject to their minimum rate and various practical constraints. Since this results in a non-convex problem, we develop a dynamic programming and monotonic optimization (DPMO) method to find the globally optimal solution in the special case of disregarding rate constraints. Subsequently, we apply a low-complexity algorithm to find sub-optimal solutions in general cases.</description>

Abstract: Massive communication is one of key scenarios of 6G where two magnitude higher connection density would be required to serve diverse services. As a promising direction, unsourced multiple access has been proved to outperform significantly over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or slotted-ALOHA in massive connections. In this paper we describe a design framework of unsourced sparse multiple access (USMA) that consists of two key modules: compressed sensing for preamble generation, and sparse interleaver division multiple access (SIDMA) for main packet transmission. Simulation results of general design of USMA show that the theoretical bound can be approached within 1~1.5 dB by using simple channel codes like convolutional. To illustrate the scalability of USMA, a customized design for ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) is proposed, so that much less memory and computation are required. Simulations results of Rayleigh fading and realistic channel estimation show that USMA based A-IoT solution can deliver nearly 4 times capacity and 6 times efficiency for random access over traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.</description>
