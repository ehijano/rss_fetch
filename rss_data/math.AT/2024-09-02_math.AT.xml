      <title>Cellular homology of compact groups: Split real forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we use the Bruhat and Schubert cells to calculate the cellular homology of the maximal compact subgroup $K$ of a connected semisimple Lie group $G$ whose Lie algebra is a split real form. We lift to the maximal compact subgroup the previously known attaching maps for the maximal flag manifold and use it to characterize algebraically the incidence order between Schubert cells. We also present algebraic formulas to compute the boundary maps which extend to the maximal compact subgroups similar formulas obtained in the case of the maximal flag manifolds. Finally, we apply our results to calculate the cellular homology of $\mbox{SO}(3)$ as the maximal compact subgroup of $\mbox{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$ and the cellular homology of $\mbox{SO}(4)$ as the maximal compact subgroup of the split real form $G_2$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric A actions on $\mathcal{A}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the variety of `symmetric' left actions of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$ on its subalgebra $\mathcal{A}(2)$. These arise as the cohomology of $\text{v}_2$ self maps $\Sigma^7 Z \longrightarrow Z$, as in arXiv:1608.06250 [math.AT]. There are $256$ $\mathbb{F}_2$ points in this variety, arising from $16$ such actions of $Sq^8$ and, for each such, $16$ actions of $Sq^{16}$. We describe in similar fashion the 1600 $\mathcal{A}$ actions on $\mathcal{A}(2)$ found by Roth(1977) and the inclusion of the variety of symmetric actions into the variety of all actions. We also describe two related varieties of $\mathcal{A}$ actions, the maps between these and the behavior of Spanier-Whitehead duality on these varieties. Finally, we note that the actions which have been used in the literature correspond to the simplest choices, in which all the coordinates equal zero.</description>

      <title>Persistent equivariant cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article has two goals. First, we hope to give an accessible introduction to persistent equivariant cohomology. Given a topological group $G$ acting on a filtered space, persistent Borel equivariant cohomology measures not only the shape of the filtration, but also attributes of the group action on the filtration, including in particular its fixed points. Second, we give an explicit description of the persistent equivariant cohomology of the circle action on the Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings of the circle, using the Serre spectral sequence and the Gysin homomorphism. Indeed, if $\frac{2\pi k}{2k+1} \le r &lt; \frac{2\pi(k+1)}{2k+3}$, then $H^*_{S^1}(\mathrm{VR}^\mathrm{m}(S^1;r))\cong \mathbb{Z}[u]/(1\cdot3\cdot5\cdot\ldots \cdot (2k+1)\, u^{k+1})$ where $\mathrm{deg}(u)=2$.</description>

Abstract: We examine configurations of finite subsets of manifolds within the homotopy-theoretic context of $\infty$-categories by way of stratified spaces. Through these higher categorical means, we identify the homotopy types of such configuration spaces in the case of n-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of the category $\mathbf{\Theta}_n$.</description>

      <title>On the bottleneck stability of rank decompositions of multi-parameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant part of modern topological data analysis is concerned with the design and study of algebraic invariants of poset representations -- often referred to as multi-parameter persistence modules. One such invariant is the minimal rank decomposition, which encodes the ranks of all the structure morphisms of the persistence module by a single ordered pair of rectangle-decomposable modules, interpreted as a signed barcode. This signed barcode generalizes the concept of persistence barcode from one-parameter persistence to any number of parameters, raising the question of its bottleneck stability. We show in this paper that the minimal rank decomposition is not stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck matching between signed barcodes. We remedy this by turning our focus to the rank exact decomposition, a related signed barcode induced by the minimal projective resolution of the module relative to the so-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under signed matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of independent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact structure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence modules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable modules. We also give a bound for the size of the rank exact decomposition that is polynomial in the size of the usual minimal projective resolution, we prove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the notion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the global dimension of a different exact structure related to the upsets of the indexing poset. This set of results combines concepts from topological data analysis and from the representation theory of posets, and we believe is relevant to both areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Discrete differential calculus on simplicial complexes and constrained homology, Chin. Ann. Math. Ser. B 44(4), 615-640, 2023], the constrained (co)homology for simplicial complexes and independence hypergraphs is constructed via differential calculus on discrete sets. In this paper, we study the differential calculus for free algebra and subsequently study the homomorphisms of constrained (co)homology induced by inclusions of simplicial complexes and independence hypergraphs. We apply the differential calculus to hypergraphs. We realize simplicial complexes and independence hypergraphs as certain invariant traces of hypergraphs. As an application, we give the constrained persistent (co)homology for filtrations of simplicial complexes and filtrations of independence hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we equate the analytic and the intersection Reidemeister torsions on spaces with a specific type of wedge singularities, which arise by turning the disc cross-sections in the tubular neighborhood of an embedded submanifold of even co-dimension into cones. Our result is related to a similar equation, in a setting disjoint from ours, which was previously obtained by Albin, Rochon and Sher.</description>

      <title>Cell decomposition and dual boundary complexes of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16657v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak geometric P=W conjecture of L. Katzarkov, A. Noll, P. Pandit, and C. Simpson asserts that for any smooth Betti moduli space $\mathcal{M}_B$ of complex dimension $d$ over a punctured Riemann surface, the dual boundary complex $\mathbb{D}\partial\mathcal{M}_B$ is homotopy equivalent to a $(d-1)$-dimensional sphere. Here, we consider $\mathcal{M}_B$ as a generic $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$-character variety defined on a Riemann surface of genus $g$, with local monodromies specified by generic semisimple conjugacy classes at $k$ punctures.
  In this article, we establish the weak geometric P=W conjecture for all \emph{very generic} $\mathcal{M}_B$ in the sense that at least one conjugacy class is regular semisimple. A crucial step is to establish a stronger form of A. Mellit's cell decomposition theorem, i.e. we decompose $\mathcal{M}_B$ (without passing to a vector bundle) into locally closed subvarieties of the form $(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^{d-2b}\times\mathcal{A}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is stably isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^b$. A second ingredient involves a motivic characterization of the integral cohomology of dual boundary complexes developed in a subsequent article [Su24]. Following C. Simpson's strategy, the proof is now an inductive computation of the dual boundary complexes from such a cell decomposition.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and Optimization of Multiparameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-valued functions on geometric data -- such as node attributes on a graph -- can be optimized using descriptors from persistent homology, allowing the user to incorporate topological terms in the loss function. When optimizing a single real-valued function (the one-parameter setting), there is a canonical choice of descriptor for persistent homology: the barcode. The operation mapping a real-valued function to its barcode is differentiable almost everywhere, and the convergence of gradient descent for losses using barcodes is relatively well understood. When optimizing a vector-valued function (the multiparameter setting), there is no unique choice of descriptor for multiparameter persistent homology, and many distinct descriptors have been proposed. This calls for the development of a general framework for differentiability and optimization that applies to a wide range of multiparameter homological descriptors. In this article, we develop such a framework and show that it encompasses well-known descriptors of different flavors, such as signed barcodes and the multiparameter persistence landscape. We complement the theory with numerical experiments supporting the idea that optimizing multiparameter homological descriptors can lead to improved performances compared to optimizing one-parameter descriptors, even when using the simplest and most efficiently computable multiparameter descriptors.</description>
