      <title>Double Slit Experiment from Nano to Femto Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of light theories began with Isaac Newton's corpuscular model, which explained reflection and refraction but could not account for diffraction and interference. In contrast, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory, explaining light's behavior through an ether-based medium, supported by his principle that each point in a wavefront acts as a secondary source. This idea was experimentally supported in the early nineteenth century when Thomas Young's double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, affirming light's wave nature. Later, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism, establishing light as an electromagnetic wave and extending the electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. In the twentieth century, Einstein's photoelectric effect introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, demonstrating that light behaves as discrete photons. Soon after, Louis de Broglie extended the idea of wave-particle duality to matter, a prediction confirmed in 1927 when Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer observed electron diffraction from a crystal and, independently, G.P. Thomson demonstrated electron diffraction through thin films, both proving that electrons also exhibit wave-like properties. This concept was dramatically visualized by Claus Jonsson's 1961 electron double-slit experiment. Recently, the ALICE collaboration observed quantum interference patterns at the femtometer scale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, pushing quantum interference studies to new frontiers.</description>

      <title>SkyNET-scape Room: An Escape Room to Explore Astroparticle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovative science communication is key to engaging the public with complex topics such as astroparticle physics. As part of the Italian PRIN 2022 funding initiative, we are developing SkyNET-scape Room, an interactive escape room designed to introduce participants to the main messengers of the high-energy universe, namely cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos.
  The experience is structured into three interactive stations, each focusing on a specific messenger and its detection method. Small teams of visitors will collaborate to solve puzzles and quizzes related to gamma-ray observations, neutrino detection, and cosmic-ray composition. Using a combination of audio, video, and written materials, participants will engage with real scientific concepts while working together to "escape." The ultimate goal is to spark curiosity, teamwork, and excitement for science, making astroparticle physics more accessible and engaging.
  In this contribution, we will present the design, implementation, and preliminary feedback from test sessions, emphasizing how gamification and interactive storytelling can serve as powerful tools for public engagement.</description>

      <title>Light intensity does not always decay with the inverse of the square of the distance: an open-inquiry laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The square inverse law with distance plays an important role in many fields of physics covering electromagnetism, optics or acoustics. However, as every law in physics has its range of validity. We propose an open-inquiry laboratory where we challenge these concepts by proposing experiments where the intensity of light decays linearly or even remains constant over a range of distances. Using the light sensors built into smartphones, it is possible to measure light curves for different sources: point, linear, planar and even LED ring lights. The analysis of these curves allows us to discuss the limits of the physical theories. This low-cost laboratory, initially proposed in the context of the COVID19 pandemic, has the virtue of challenging intuition and encouraging the critical spirit of the students.</description>
