      <title>Isochronous oscillator with a singular position-dependent mass and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega &gt; 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x &gt; 0$ and $x &lt; 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x &gt; 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral with the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels which is in line with the expectation that classical systems that support isochronous oscillations are associated in their quantized versions with equally-spaced spectra. The spacing between energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator \`a la von Roos.</description>

      <title>Secure Composition of Quantum Key Distribution and Symmetric Key Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows Alice and Bob to share a secret key over an insecure channel with proven information-theoretic security against an adversary whose strategy is bounded only by the laws of physics. Composability-based security proofs of QKD ensure that using the established key with a one-time-pad encryption scheme provides information theoretic secrecy for the message. In this paper, we consider the problem of using the QKD established key with a secure symmetric key-based encryption algorithm and use an approach based on hybrid encryption to provide a proof of security for the composition.
  Hybrid encryption was first proposed as a public key cryptographic algorithm with proven security for messages of unrestricted length. We use an extension of this framework to correlated randomness setting (Sharifian et al. in ISIT 2021) to propose a quantum-enabled Key Encapsulation Mechanism (qKEM) and quantum-enabled hybrid encryption (qHE), and prove a composition theorem for the security of the qHE. We construct a qKEM with proven security using an existing QKD (Portmann et al. in Rev. of Mod. Physics 2022). Using this qKEM with a secure Data Encapsulation Mechanism (DEM), that can be constructed using a one-time symmetric key encryption scheme, results in an efficient encryption system for unrestricted length messages with proved security against an adversary with access to efficient computations on a quantum computer (i.e. post-quantum secure encryption without using any computational assumptions.)</description>

      <title>Modeling Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution for the NASA Quantum Communications Analysis Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most practical, and sought after, applications of quantum mechanics in the field of information science is the use of entanglement distribution to communicate quantum information effectively. Similar to the continued improvements of functional quantum computers over the past decade, advances in demonstrations of entanglement distribution over long distances may enable new applications in aeronautics and space communications. The existing NASA Quantum Communications Analysis Suite (NQCAS) software models such applications, but limited experimental data exists to verify the model's theoretical results. There is, however, a large body of experimental data in the relevant literature for entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD). This paper details a Monte Carlo-based QKD model that uses NQCAS input parameters to generate an estimated QKD link budget for verification of NQCAS. The model generates link budget statistics like key rates, error rates, and S values that can then be compared to the experimental values in the literature. Preliminary comparisons show many similarities between the simulated and experimental data, supporting the model's validity. A verified NQCAS model will inform experimental work conducted in Glenn Research Center's (GRC) NASA Quantum Metrology Laboratory (NQML), supporting the United States Quantum Initiative and potential NASA missions.</description>

      <title>Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to mature, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures. In particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessary support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization are typically not designed for qubit links of wildly varying levels of duration or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a complete and parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum computers, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains up to a 36% increase in circuit fidelity, accompanied by execution time improvements of up to 1.92x. Additionally, owning to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves consistent solve time improvements of 2-4x over a chiplet-aware Qiskit baseline.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quantum mechanics with real-valued Schr\"{o}dinger equation,single-event quantum-path dynamics, Mauprtuis path in parameter space, and branching paths beyond semiclassics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics and the Schr\"{o}dinger function (or the so-called wavefunction) in the following four aspects. (1) The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is reconstructed from scratch in the real field only, without referring to Newtonian mechanics nor optics. Only the very simple conditions such as the space-time translational symmetry and the conservation of flux and energy are imposed on the factorization of the density distribution in configuration space, giving rise to a two-dimensional real vector. On returning to the original Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the imaginary number arises naturally. (2) Like the Langevin equation in a Brownian dynamics, we formulate a single-event path dynamics in quantum mechanics, contrasting with the Schr\"{o}dinger distribution function. The path thus attained is referred to as one-world path, which represents, for instance, a path of a singly launched electron in the double-slit experiment that leaves a spot at the measurement board, while many of accumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern. We start from the Feynman-Kac formula to draw a relation between a stochastic dynamics and the parabolic differential equations, to one of which the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is transformed. (3) To highlight the roles of the flux and energy conservation in the Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics, we build that the quantum Maupertuis-Hamilton principle, which reveals the symplectic structure in the parameter space. (4) We track how the inherent quantum nature like the Huygens-principle-like properties is built. We show that classical trajectory components in semiclassics are demanded to branch into many coherent pieces beyond the semiclassical regime and dissolve into the deep dynamics of genuine full quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental setup for manipulating the spontaneous emission of trapped ions, based on a spatial light modulator. Anticipated novelties include the potential to entangle more than two ions through a single photon detection event and control the visibility for spatially distinguishable emitters. The setup can be adapted to most of the existing ion traps commonly used in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Recurrence in discrete-time quantum stochastic walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplay between quantum interference and classical randomness can enhance performance of various quantum information tasks. In the present paper we analyze recurrence phenomena in the discrete-time quantum stochastic walk on a line, which is a quantum stochastic process that interpolates between quantum and classical walk dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that introducing classical randomness can reduce the recurrence probability -- despite the fact that the classical random walk returns with certainty -- and we identify the conditions under which this intriguing phenomenon occurs. Numerical evaluation of the first-return generating function allows us to investigate the asymptotics of the return probability as the step number approaches infinity. This provides strong evidence that the suppression of recurrence probability is not a transient effect but a robust feature of the underlying quantum-classical interplay in the asymptotic limit. Our results show that for certain tasks discrete-time quantum stochastic walks outperform both classical random walks and unitary quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</description>

      <title>Effect of spontaneous emission on a tanh model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of spontaneous emission on a tanh model. The effect is characterized by introducing an imaginary term and a shift in the model, resulting in its non-Hermitian nature. This leads to the appearance of light beams in the population evolution, primarily influenced by the coupling strength and the shift. We derive the necessary conditions to identify the allowed and forbidden regions in the diagram of the real part of the energy. Additionally, we analyze how sweep velocity and time affect the imaginary part of the energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the similarities between our model and the Rabi and Landau-Zener models. Throughout this work, we confirm that our theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Floquet controlled-phase gates in Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms stand out as a highly promising platform for realizing quantum computation with significant advantages in constructing high-fidelity quantum gates. Floquet frequency modulation (FFM) is a potent approach for achieving resilient quantum gates through the manipulation of modulation parameters, thereby inducing intricate dynamics within quantum systems. This work introduces a method to realize controlled arbitrary phase gates in Rydberg atoms by manipulating system dynamics by the means of FFM. Notably, this method eliminates the need for laser addressing, significantly enhancing the convenience for future practical applications. Furthermore, this approach can be integrated with soft quantum control strategies to enhance the fidelity and robustness of the resultant controlled-phase gates. Finally, this methodology is applied in Grover's quantum search algorithms to prepare quantum states, demonstrating its substantial significance for future quantum information processing applications. This work leveraging Rydberg atoms and Floquet frequency modulation may herald a new era of scalable and reliable quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a quantum variational algorithm for securities transactions settlement optimization, based on a novel mathematical formalization of the problem that includes the most relevant constraints considered in the pan-European securities settlement platform TARGET2-Securities. The proposed algorithm is designed for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices, specifically targeting IBM's superconducting qubit machines. We adopt non-linear activation functions to encode inequality constraints in the objective function of the problem, and design customized noise mitigation techniques to alleviate the effect of readout errors. We consider batches of up to 40 trades obtained from real transactional data to benchmark our algorithm on quantum hardware against classical and quantum-inspired solvers.</description>

      <title>Heat semigroup representation of Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces novel numerical algorithms for computational quantum mechanics, grounded in a representation of the Laplace operator -- frequently used to model kinetic energy in quantum systems -- via the heat semigroup. The key advantage of this approach lies in its computational efficiency, particularly within the framework of multiresolution analysis, where the heat equation can be solved rapidly. This results in an effective and scalable method for evaluating kinetic energy in quantum systems. The proposed multiwavelet-based Laplacian approximation is tested through two fundamental quantum chemistry applications: self-consistent field calculations and the time evolution of Schr\"odinger-type equations.</description>

      <title>Efficient wireless charging of a quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the wireless charging of a quantum battery (QB) via $n$ charging units, whose coupling is mediated by a common bosonic reservoir. We consider the general scenarios in which the charger energy is not maximal and the QB has residual ergotropy initially. It is found that the charging performance improves with the increase of the coupling strength. In the strong coupling regime, the charging time is insensitive to the charger energy, the number of charging units, and the residual ergotropy in the QB, while the ergotropy charged on the QB strongly depends on the charger energy and ergotropy, and the residual ergotropy in the QB does not help to enhance its performance. Moreover, the multiple charging units help to enhance the charging performance in the weak and moderate coupling regimes, while they are less efficient in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of transitions between quantum nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a transition between nonequilibrium steady states, the entropic cost associated with the maintenance of steady-state currents can be distinguished from that arising from the transition itself through the concepts of excess/housekeeping entropy flux and adiabatic/nonadiabatic entropy production. The thermodynamics of this transition is embodied by the Hatano-Sasa relation. In this letter, we show that for a slow transition between quantum nonequilibrium steady states the nonadiabatic entropy production is, to leading order, given by the path action with respect to a Riemannian metric in the parameter space which can be connected to the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov quantum Fisher information. We then demonstrate how to obtain minimally dissipative paths by solving the associated geodesic equation and illustrate the procedure with a simple example of a three-level maser. Furthermore, by identifying the quantum Fisher information with respect to time as a metric in state space, we derive an upper bound on the excess entropy flux that holds for arbitrarily fast processes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements using Time-Frequency Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of fluorescence lifetime became an important tool in biology and medical science. So far, established methods of fluorescence lifetime measurements require the illumination of the investigated probes with pulsed or amplitude-modulated light. In this paper, we examine the limitations of an innovative method of fluorescence lifetime using time-frequency correlated photons generated by a continuous-wave source. For this purpose, we investigate the lifetime of IR-140 to demonstrate the functional principle and its dependencies on different experimental parameters. We also compare this technique with state-of-the-art FLIM and observed an improved figure-of-merit. Finally, we discuss the potential of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Riemannian quantum circuit optimization based on matrix product operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems, with a particular focus on one-dimensional systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoding quantum key distribution in free-space horizontal links during nighttime and daytime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a groundbreaking advancement in secure communication, enabling secure key exchange over vast distances and offering robust encryption for the future quantum internet. However, the compatibility between fiber and free-space infrastructures continues to pose challenges for QKD protocols. Indeed, free-space and fiber-based networks commonly use different wavelengths and qubits encoding schemes. On the one hand, free-space QKD typically exploits visible light for its beneficial beam divergence compared to longer wavelengths, and polarization encoding for its robustness against turbulence. On the other hand, fiber-based QKD employs infrared light, particularly the C-band, because it shows the minimum losses with silica fibers, and time-bin encoding, due to polarization instability in optical fibers. In our study, we demonstrate the viability of a time-bin encoded QKD protocol operating in the C-band through horizontal turbulent free-space channels. We test the setup into a 50 m and a 500 m long links, achieving an average secure key rate of, respectively, 793 kbps and 40 kbps over several hours of measurements. The results encourage further exploration of the interoperability between free-space and fiber-based infrastructures, opening new possibilities for connecting terminal users with satellites in hybrid infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Photon-Number Conserved Universal Quantum Logic Employing Continuous-Time Quantum Walk on Dual-Rail Qubit Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a synergy between dual-rail qubit encoding and continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) to realize universal quantum logic in superconducting circuits. Utilizing the photon-number-conserving dynamics of CTQW on dual-rail transmons, which systematically transform leakage and relaxation into erasure events, our architecture facilitates the suppression of population leakage and the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates. We construct single-, two-, and three-qubit operations that preserve dual-rail encoding, facilitated by tunable coupler strengths compatible with current superconducting qubit platforms. Numerical simulations confirm robust behavior against dephasing, relaxation, and imperfections in coupling, underscoring the erasure-friendly nature of the system. This hardware-efficient scheme thus provides a practical pathway to early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Tunable anharmonicity in cavity optomechanics in the unresolved sideband regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing a controlled and strong anharmonicity in mechanical systems is a present challenge of nanomechanics. In cavity optomechanics a mechanical oscillator may be made anharmonic by ponderomotively coupling its motion to the light field of a laser-driven cavity. In the regime where the mechanical resonating frequency and the single-photon coupling constant are small compared to the decay rate of the cavity field, it turns out that the quantum electromagnetic fluctuations of the laser field drive the oscillator into a high-temperature thermal state. The motional state may however be highly non-Gaussian; we show that a precise tuning of system parameters may even lead to a purely quartic effective potential for the mechanical oscillator. We present a theory that predicts the measurable signatures left by the mechanical anharmonicity. In particular, we obtain analytically and numerically the mechanical displacement spectrum, and explore the imprints of the mechanical anharmonicity on the cavity light field.</description>

      <title>Spectral and temporal properties of type-II parametric down-conversion: The impact of losses during state generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study spectral and temporal properties of pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) generated in lossy waveguides. Our theoretical approach is based on the formalism of Gaussian states and the Langevin equation, which is elaborated for weak parametric down-conversion and photon-number-unresolved click detection. Using the example of frequency-degenerate type-II SPDC generated under pump-idler group-velocity-matching condition, we show how the joint-spectral intensity, mode structure, normalized second-order correlation function, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference pattern depend on internal losses of the SPDC process. In addition, we propose a new method for the experimental determination of internal losses of nonlinear waveguides which is based on the measurement of the normalized second-order correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Experimental distributed quantum sensing in a noisy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision advantages offered by harnessing the quantum states of sensors can be readily compromised by noise. However, when the noise has a different spatial function than the signal of interest, recent theoretical work shows how the advantage can be maintained and even significantly improved. In this work we experimentally demonstrate the associated sensing protocol, using trapped-ion sensors. An entangled state of multi-dimensional sensors is created that isolates and optimally detects a signal, whilst being insensitive to otherwise overwhelming noise fields with different spatial profiles over the sensor locations. The quantum protocol is found to outperform a perfect implementation of the best comparable strategy without sensor entanglement. While our demonstration is carried out for magnetic and electromagnetic fields over a few microns, the technique is readily applicable over arbitrary distances and for arbitrary fields, thus present a promising application for emerging quantum sensor networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous wavefunction collapse models offer a solution to the quantum measurement problem, by modifying the Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinear and stochastic terms. The Continuous Spontaneous Localisation (CSL) model is the most studied among these models, with phenomenological parameters that are constrained by experiments. Here, we exploit the recent analysis of LISA Pathfinder's angular motion data to derive a tighter constraint than previously achieved with translational motion. Moreover, we identify the general conditions for preferring rotational measurement over translational ones for constraining the CSL model.</description>

      <title>Balanced cross-Kerr coupling for superconducting qubit readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersive readout, the standard method for measuring superconducting qubits, is limited by multiphoton qubit-resonator processes arising even at moderate drive powers. These processes degrade performance, causing dispersive readout to lag behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel readout method, termed "junction readout". Junction readout leverages the nonperturbative cross-Kerr interaction resulting from coupling a qubit and a resonator via a Josephson junction. Furthermore, by adding a capacitive coupling in parallel to the junction, Purcell decay can be suppressed without the need for a Purcell filter. We also show that junction readout is more robust against deleterious multiphoton processes, and offers greater flexibility for resonator frequency allocation. Crucially, junction readout achieves superior performance compared to dispersive readout while maintaining similar hardware overhead. Numerical simulations show that junction readout can achieve fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ in under $30$ ns, making it a promising alternative for superconducting qubit readout with current hardware.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive transport in chaotic quantum systems with nodal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08383v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Investigating Parameter-Efficiency of Hybrid QuGANs Based on Geometric Properties of Generated Sea Route Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for artificially generated data for the development, training and testing of new algorithms is omnipresent. Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the properties of superfluid and normal liquid ${}^4$He using ab initio potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of liquid ${}^4$He in both the normal and superfluid phases using path integral Monte Carlo simulations and recently developed ab initio potentials that incorporate pair, three-body, and four-body interactions. By focusing on the energy per particle as a representative observable, we use a perturbative approach to quantify the individual contributions of the many-body potentials and systematically propagate their associated uncertainties. Our findings indicate that the three-body and four-body potentials contribute to the total energy by approximately 4% and 0.4%, respectively. However, the primary limitation in achieving highly accurate first-principles calculations arises from the uncertainty in the four-body potential, which currently dominates the propagated uncertainty. In addition to the energy per particle, we analyze other key observables, including the superfluid fraction, condensed fraction, and pair distribution function, all of which demonstrate excellent agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions is one of the best probes of the QGP formed in these collisions. Resorting to accurate methods to describe the $Q\bar{Q}$ evolution in a QGP is a prerequisite for the precise interpretation of experimental data. Among these methods, the quantum master equations (QME) derived within the formalism of open quantum systems are particularly relevant. We present exact numerical solutions in a 1D setting of previously derived quantum master equations (QME) in their quantum Brownian regime. Distinctive features of the in-medium bottomonia evolution with the QME are presented; some phenomenological consequences are addressed by considering evolutions for a fixed as well as EPOS4 temperature profiles. Next, we investigate the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation (often used to describe charmonium production in URHIC) by benchmarking the corresponding evolutions on the exact solutions derived with the QME for the case of a $c\bar{c}$ pair.</description>

      <title>The parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) hold promise as for the realization of neuromorphic and quantum computation. Yet, their rich bifurcation structure remains largely not understood. Here, we employ secular perturbation theory to map the stability regions of these networks, and identify the regime where the system can be mapped to an Ising model. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how the bifurcations arise from the competition between the global parametric drive and linear coupling between the KPOs. We then extend this framework to larger networks with all-to-all equal coupling, deriving analytical expressions for the full cascade of bifurcation transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that these transitions become uniformly spaced, leading to a highly regular structure. Our results reveal the precise bounds under which KPO networks have an Ising-like solution space, and thus provides crucial guidance for their experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We find that the linear deviation from steady states is memory-less, similar to the closed system. The linear response of observables while ramping the Hamiltonian is still related to the derivative of the retarded Green's function. However, as one ramps the dissipation, the corresponding coefficient is determined by a new high-order correlation function in the steady state. Our work gives a neat result and generalizes the tool of ramping dynamics to study the many-body correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system dictates its dynamics, which can be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. Despite the significant implications of chaotic billiard systems with mixed curvatures, those whose boundaries feature both positive and negative curvature remain relatively under-explored. This study introduces two such billiards: a bean-shaped billiard and a peanut-shaped billiard, the latter being a variant of Cassini ovals. Unlike traditional chaotic billiards, these systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing regions along their boundaries, with no neutral segments. We examine both classical and quantum dynamics of these billiards and observe a strong alignment between the two perspectives. For classical analysis, the billiard flow diagram and billiard map reveal sensitivity to initial conditions, a hallmark of classical chaos. In the quantum domain, we use nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and spectral complexity as statistical measures to characterise chaotic behaviour. Both classical and quantum mechanical analysis are in firm agreement with each other. One of the most striking quantum phenomena we observe is the eigenfunction scarring (both scars and super-scars). Scarring phenomena serve as a rich visual manifestation of quantum and classical correspondence, and highlight quantum suppression chaos at a local level. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chaos, especially in billiard systems with mixed curvature boundaries.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Spectroscopy of Antiprotonic Atoms for Probing Strong-field QED</title>

Abstract: PAX (antiProtonic Atom X-ray spectroscopy) is a new experiment with the aim to test strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects by performing high-precision x-ray spectroscopy of antiprotonic atoms. By utilizing advanced microcalorimeter detection techniques and a low-energy antiproton beam provided by the ELENA ring at CERN, gaseous targets will be used for the creation of antiprotonic atoms, and the measurement of transitions between circular Rydberg states will be conducted with up to two orders of magnitude improved accuracy over previous studies using high-purity germanium detectors. Our approach eliminates the longstanding issue of nuclear uncertainties that have hindered prior studies using highly charged ions, thus enabling direct and purely QED-focused measurements. By precisely probing atomic systems with electric fields up to two orders of magnitude above the Schwinger limit, PAX will test vacuum polarization and second-order QED corrections, opening new frontiers in fundamental physics and uncovering potential pathways to physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Integrated Photonic Programmable Random Matrix Generator with Minimal Active Components</title>

Abstract: Random matrices are fundamental in photonic computing because of their ability to model and enhance complex light interactions and signal processing capabilities. In manipulating classical light, random operations are utilized for random projections and dimensionality reduction, which are important for analog signal processing, computing, and imaging. In quantum information processing, random unitary operations are essential to boson sampling algorithms for multiphoton states in linear photonic circuits. In photonic circuits, random operations are realized through disordered structures resulting in fixed unitary operations or through large meshes of interferometers and reconfigurable phase shifters, which require a large number of phase shifters. In this article, we introduce a compact photonic circuit for generating random matrices by utilizing programmable phase modulation layers interlaced with a fixed mixing operator. We show that using only two random phase layers is sufficient for producing output optical signals with a white-noise profile, even for highly sparse input optical signals. We experimentally demonstrate these results using a silicon photonics circuit with tunable thermal phase shifters and utilize waveguide lattices as mixing layers. The proposed circuit offers a practical method for generating random matrices for photonic information processing and for applications in data encryption.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-Gibbs states in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that equilibrium energy distributions in many-body chaotic systems can be qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions. This effect can appear in systems with finite energy spectra, which support both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum degeneracy, when the eigenstates fill a substantial part of the Hilbert space. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum rings have emerged as a playground for quantum mechanics and topological physics, with promising technological applications. Experimentally realizable quantum rings, albeit at the scale of a few nanometers, are 3D nanostructures. Surprisingly, no theories exist for the topology of the Fermi sea of quantum rings, and a microscopic theory of superconductivity in nanorings is also missing. In this paper, we remedy this situation by developing a mathematical model for the topology of the Fermi sea and Fermi surface, which features non-trivial hole pockets of electronic states forbidden by quantum confinement, as a function of the geometric parameters of the nanoring. The exactly solvable mathematical model features two topological transitions in the Fermi surface upon shrinking the nanoring size either, first, vertically (along its axis of revolution) and, then, in the plane orthogonal to it, or the other way round. These two topological transitions are reflected in a kink and in a characteristic discontinuity, respectively, in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the quantum ring, which is also computed. Also, closed-form expressions for the Fermi energy as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring are provided. These, along with the DOS, are then used to derive BCS equations for the superconducting critical temperature of nanorings as a function of the geometric parameters of the ring. The $T_c$ varies non-monotonically with the dominant confinement size and exhibits a prominent maximum, whereas it is a monotonically increasing function of the other, non-dominant, length scale. For the special case of a perfect square toroid (where the two length-scales coincide), the $T_c$ increases monotonically with increasing the confinement size, and in this case, there is just one topological transition.</description>

Abstract: Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) is a classical numerical method widely known and applied to simulate several physical phenomena. In this paper, we study the translation of LGCA on quantum computers (QC) using computational basis encoding (CBE), developing methods for different purposes. In particular, we clarify and discuss some fundamental limitations and advantages in using CBE and quantum walk as streaming procedure. Using quantum walks affect the possible encoding of classical states in quantum orthogonal states, feature linked to the unitarity of collision and to the possibility of getting a quantum advantage. Then, we give efficient procedures for optimizing collisional quantum circuits, based on the classical features of the model. This is applied specifically to fluid dynamic LGCA. Alongside, a new collision circuit for a 1-dimensional model is proposed. We address the important point of invariants in LGCA providing a method for finding how many invariants appear in their QC formulation. Quantum invariants outnumber the classical expectations, proving the necessity of further research. Lastly, we prove the validity of a method for retrieving any quantity of interest based on quantum phase estimation (QPE).</description>

      <title>Satisfiability problems and algebras of boolean constraint system games</title>

Abstract: Mermin and Peres showed that there are boolean constraint systems (BCSs) which are not satisfiable, but which are satisfiable with quantum observables. This has led to a burgeoning theory of quantum satisfiability for constraint systems, connected to nonlocal games and quantum contextuality. In this theory, different types of quantum satisfying assignments can be understood as representations of the BCS algebra of the system. This theory is closely related to the theory of synchronous games and algebras, and every synchronous algebra is a BCS algebra and vice-versa. The purpose of this paper is to further develop the role of BCS algebras in this theory, and tie up some loose ends: We give a new presentation of BCS algebras in terms of joint spectral projections, and show that it is equivalent to the standard definition. We construct a constraint system which is $C^*$-satisfiable but not tracially satisfiable. We show that certain reductions between constraint systems lead to $*$-homomorphisms between the BCS algebras of the systems, and use this to streamline and strengthen several results of Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini on analogues of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem. In particular, we show that the question of whether or not there is a non-hyperlinear group is linked to dichotomy theorems for $\mathcal{R}^{\mathcal{U}}$-satisfiability.</description>

Abstract: The quantum digital signature protocol offers a replacement for most aspects of public-key digital signatures ubiquitous in today's digital world. A major advantage of a quantum-digital-signatures protocol is that it can have information-theoretic security, whereas public-key cryptography cannot. Here we demonstrate and characterize hardware to implement entanglement-based quantum digital signatures over our campus network. Over 25 hours, we collect measurements on our campus network, where we measure sufficiently low quantum bit error rates (&lt;5% in most cases) which in principle enable quantum digital signatures at over 50 km as shown through rigorous simulation accompanied by a noise model developed specifically for our implementation. These results show quantum digital signatures can be successfully employed over deployed fiber. Moreover, our reported method provides great flexibility in the number of users, but with reduced entanglement rate per user. Finally, while the current implementation of our entanglement-based approach has a low signature rate, feasible upgrades would significantly increase the signature rate.</description>

      <title>Tripartite multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model: Analytical solution and Wigner nonclassicalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a generic tripartite quantum system featuring a single qubit interacting concurrently with two quantized harmonic oscillators via nonlinear multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings (MPJC) interactions. Assuming the qubit is initially prepared in a superposition state and the two oscillators are in arbitrary Fock states, we analytically trace the temporal evolution of this tripartite pure initial state. We identify four broad cases, each further divided into two subcases, and derive exact analytical solutions for most cases. Notably, we obtain perfect transfer of excitations between the oscillators by carefully selecting system parameters. In addition, we extensively examine the manner in which the nonclassicalities of various initial oscillator Fock states, quantified by the volume of negative regions in the associated Wigner functions, evolve under the MPJC Hamiltonian, considering diverse system parameters including environmental effects. Besides producing substantial enhancements in the initial value for higher photon number states, our analysis reveals that driven solely by the initial qubit energy, with both oscillators initialized in the vacuum state, the nonlinear MPJC interaction yields a significant amount of nontrivial Wigner negativity in the oscillators. The additional nonlinearity introduced by the multiphoton process plays a pivotal role in surpassing the initial nonclassicalities of the photon number states.</description>

      <title>Error Crafting in Mixed Quantum Gate Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, errors in unitary gate synthesis is comparable with noise inherent in the gates themselves. While mixed synthesis can suppress such coherent errors quadratically, there is no clear understanding on its remnant error, which hinders us from designing a holistic and practical error countermeasure. In this work, we propose that the classical characterizability of synthesis error can be exploited; remnant errors can be crafted to satisfy desirable properties. We prove that we can craft the remnant error of arbitrary single-qubit unitaries to be Pauli and depolarizing errors, while the conventional twirling cannot be applied in general. For Pauli rotation gates, in particular, the crafting enables us to suppress the remnant error up to cubic order, which results in synthesis with a T-count of $\log_2(1/\varepsilon)$ up to accuracy of $\varepsilon=10^{-9}$. Our work opens a novel avenue in quantum circuit design and architecture that orchestrates error countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schr\"odinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computation needs rapid quantum communication to network qubits fabricated on different chips and long-range couplers to implement efficient quantum error-correction codes. Quantum channels used for these purposes are best modeled by multimode resonators, which lie between single-mode cavities and waveguides with a continuum of modes. In this Letter, we propose a non-Markovian formalism for quantum state transfer using coupling strengths comparable to the channel's free spectral range ($g{\sim}\fsr$). Our scheme merges features of both the STIRAP-based methods for single-mode cavities and the pitch-and-catch protocol for long waveguides, integrating their advantage of low loss and high speed. It is immune to thermal channel occupations if using harmonic resonators for the sender and receiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) with discrete modulation combines advantages of CVQKD, such as the implementability using readily available technologies, with advantages of discrete variable quantum key distribution, such as easier error correction procedures. We consider a prepare-and-measure CVQKD protocol, where Alice chooses from a set of four coherent states and Bob performs a heterodyne measurement, the result of which is discretised in both key and test rounds. We provide a security proof against coherent attacks in the finite-size regime, and compute the achievable key rate. To this end, we employ the generalised entropy accumulation theorem, as well as recent advances in conic optimisation, yielding improved key rates compared to previous works. At metropolitan distances, our method can provide positive key rates for the order of $10^8$ rounds.</description>

Abstract: In some quantum secret sharing schemes, it is known that some shares can be distributed to participants before a secret is given to the dealer. However, it is unclear whether some shares can be distributed before a secret is given in the ramp quantum secret sharing schemes with the highest coding rate. In this paper, we propose procedures to distribute some shares before a secret is given in those schemes. The new procedures enhances applicability of the secret sharing schemes to wider scenarios as some participants can be unavailable when the dealer obtains the quantum secret. Then we prove that our new encoding procedures retain the correspondences between quantum secrets and quantum shares in the original schemes, which ensures the highest coding rates of the original schemes are also retained.</description>

Abstract: The twin-field class quantum key distribution (TF-class QKD) has experimentally demonstrated the ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit without requiring a quantum repeater, as a revolutional milestone. In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Moreover, we have shown that with well calibration of the modulators, the attack can be eliminated. Through this study, we highlight the importance of system calibration in the practical security in TF-class QKD implementation.</description>

      <title>Prethermal Floquet time crystals in chiral multiferroic chains and applications as quantum sensors of AC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of prethermal Floquet Time Crystal (pFTC) in disordered chiral multiferroic chains. The model is an extension of the usual periodically driven nearest-neighbor disordered Heisenberg chain, with additional next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings and DMI interactions due to external magnetic and electric couplings. We derive the phase diagram of the model, characterizing the magnetization, entanglement, and coherence dynamics of the system along the extended interactions. In addition, we explore the application of the pFTC as quantum sensors of AC fields. The sensor performance to estimate small AC fields is quantified through the quantum Fisher information (QFI) measure. The sensor offers several advantages as compared to those composed of non-interacting spins due to its intrinsic robustness, long coherent interrogation time, and many-body correlations. Specifically, the sensor can overcome the standard quantum limit ($\rm{SQL} \sim N t^2$) during the prethermal regime, reaching an optimum performance at the pFTC lifetime $t^*$, where the $\rm{QFI}/Nt^{*^2} \sim N^\alpha$ with $\alpha &gt; 0$, scaling superlinarly with the number of spins. Different from \text{full} FTCs, the prethermal lifetime does not diverge in the thermodynamic limit, nevertheless it can be increasingly long with tuning system parameters.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generic problem of state preparation for open quantum systems. As is well known, open quantum systems can be simulated by quantum trajectories described by a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. In this context, the state preparation problem becomes a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem. The SOC problem requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is generally challenging to solve. A notable exception are the so-called path integral (PI) control problems for which one can estimate the optimal control solution by sampling. We derive a class of quantum state preparation problems that can be solved with PI control. We name the resulting algorithm Quantum Diffusion Control (QDC). By only requiring the propagation of state vectors $\psi$, QDC presents a quadratic advantage over density-centered approaches, such as PMP-based methods. Unlike most conventional quantum control algorithms, it does not require computing gradients of the cost function to determine the optimal control. Instead, it is computed by iterative importance sampling. The SOC setting allows in principle for a state feedback control solution, whereas Lindblad-based methods are restricted to open-loop control. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through some examples of open loop control for single- and multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex numbers are widely used in quantum physics and are indispensable components for describing quantum systems and their dynamical behavior. The resource theory of imaginarity has been built recently, enabling a systematic research of complex numbers in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop two theoretical methods for quantifying imaginarity, motivated by recent progress within resource theories of entanglement and coherence. We provide quantifiers of imaginarity by the convex roof construction and quantifiers of the imaginarity by the least imaginarity of the input pure states under real operations. We also apply these tools to study the state conversion problem in resource theory of imaginarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality.
  Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient estimation of nonlinear functions of quantum states is crucial for various key tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, fidelity estimation, and feature analysis of quantum data. Conventional methods using state tomography and estimating numerous terms of the series expansion are computationally expensive, while alternative approaches based on a purified query oracle impose practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce the quantum state function (QSF) framework by extending the SWAP test via linear combination of unitaries and parameterized quantum circuits. Our framework enables the implementation of arbitrary degree-$n$ polynomial functions of quantum states with precision $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. We further apply QSF for developing quantum algorithms of fundamental tasks, achieving a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/(\varepsilon^2\kappa))$ for both von Neumann entropy estimation and quantum state fidelity calculations, where $\kappa$ represents the minimal nonzero eigenvalue. Our work establishes a concise and unified paradigm for estimating and realizing nonlinear functions of quantum states, paving the way for the practical processing and analysis of quantum data.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection Method on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has gained attention for its potential to address computational challenges. However, whether those algorithms can effectively solve practical problems and outperform their classical counterparts, especially on current quantum hardware, remains a critical question. In this work, we propose a novel quantum machine learning method, called Quantum Support Vector Data Description (QSVDD), for practical image anomaly detection, which aims to achieve both parameter efficiency and superior accuracy compared to classical models. Emulation results indicate that QSVDD demonstrates favourable recognition capabilities compared to classical baselines, achieving an average accuracy of over 90% on benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that QSVDD has a comparable expressivity to classical counterparts while requiring only a fraction of the parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first implementation of a quantum anomaly detection method for general image datasets on a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of over 80% with only 16 parameters on the device, providing initial evidence of QSVDD's practical viability in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and highlighting its significant reduction in parameter requirements.</description>

Abstract: We formalize a rigorous connection between barren plateaus (BP) in variational quantum algorithms and exponential concentration of quantum kernels for machine learning. Our results imply that recently proposed strategies to build BP-free quantum circuits can be utilized to construct useful quantum kernels for machine learning. This is illustrated by a numerical example employing a provably BP-free quantum neural network to construct kernel matrices for classification datasets of increasing dimensionality without exponential concentration.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing offers unparalleled processing power but raises significant data privacy challenges. Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) leverages inherent quantum noise to safeguard privacy, surpassing traditional DP. This paper develops comprehensive noise profiles, identifies noise types beneficial for QDP, and highlights teh need for practical implementations beyond theoretical models. Existing QDP mechanisms, limited to single noise sources, fail to reflect teh multi-source noise reality of quantum systems. We propose a resilient hybrid QDP mechanism utilizing channel and measurement noise, optimizing privacy budgets to balance privacy and utility. Additionally, we introduce Lifted Quantum Differential Privacy, offering enhanced randomness for improved privacy audits and quantum algorithm evaluation.</description>

      <title>Optical information encryption using general temporal ghost imaging with practical experimental condition</title>

Abstract: Temporal Ghost Imaging (TGI), which reconstructs fast temporal signals using a slow detector, holds significant potential in optical communication, high-speed imaging, and quantum information processing. However, achieving high-quality information reconstruction has been a major challenge for the practical application of TGI. A theoretical model [\emph{ Applied Optics}, 62(5): 1175-1182 (2023)] was proposed to investigate the influence of experimental parameters of the slow detector on image quality; however, its experimental verification was hitherto lacking. In this study, we implemented a multi-bit information transmission scheme based on both quantum and classical TGI methods. Experimental validation confirmed the accuracy of the theoretical model and demonstrated its application in encrypting noisy multi-bit information. The experimental results demonstrate that as the information coding density increases, the decoding accuracy becomes highly sensitive to the detection accuracy and threshold of the slow detector. When these parameters degrade, the decoding quality deteriorates significantly. Additionally, our system shows notable robustness against detection noise, but loses the ability to accurately decode when the noise amplitude becomes too high. Our work endows TGI with optical information encryption capabilities in practical systems and furnishes comprehensive guidelines for the further application of TGI.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. We also present the first demonstration of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of Nb SRF cavities. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Periodically-Driven Dissipative Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), featured by the collapse of bulk-band eigenstates into the localized boundary modes of the systems, is one of most striking properties in the fields of non-Hermitian physics. Unique physical phenomena related to the NHSE have attracted a lot of interest, however, their experimental realizations usually require nonreciprocal hopping, which faces a great challenge in ultracold-atom systems. In this work, we propose to realize the NHSE in a 1D optical lattice by periodically-driven ultracold atoms in the presence of staggered atomic loss. By studying the effective Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation, we reveal the underlying mechanism for the periodic-driving-induced the NHSE. We found that the robust NHSE can be tuned by driving phase, which is manifested by the dynamical localization. Most remarkably, we uncover the periodic-driving-induced critical skin effect for two coupled chains with different driving phases, accompanied by the appearance of size-dependent topological in-gap modes. Our studies provide a feasible way for observing the NHSE and exploring corresponding unique physical phenomena due to the interplay of non-Hermiticity and many-body statistics in ultracold-atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate continuous Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) nondestructive monitoring of the electron spin polarization of an atomic vapor in a microfabricated vapor cell within an optical resonator. The two-chamber silicon and glass cell contains $^{87}$Rb and 1.3 amagat of N$_{2}$ buffer gas, and is placed within a planar optical resonator formed by two mirrors with dichroic dielectric coatings to resonantly enhance the coupling to phase-modulated probe light near the D$_2$ line at 780 nm. We describe the theory of signal generation in this system, including the spin-dependent complex refractive index, cavity optical transfer functions, and PDH signal response to spin polarization. We observe cavity transmission and PDH signals across $\approx 200$ GHz of detuning around the atomic resonance line. By resonant optical pumping on the 795 nm D$_1$ line, we observe spin-dependent cavity line shifts, in good agreement with theory. We use the saturation of the line shift vs. optical pumping power to calibrate the number density and efficiency of the optical pumping. In the unresolved sideband regime, we observe quantum-noise-limited PDH readout of the spin polarization density, with a flat noise floor of $9 \times 10^9$ spins cm$^{-3}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for frequencies above 700 Hz. We note possible extensions of the technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using linear response, an exact path integral technique and symmetry considerations. All three approaches independently lead to conclude that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from assuming it would not. We also explain why the RSJ physics differs from that of 1D quantum impurity problems. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources $X,Y$ with joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot, \cdot)$. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. Alice communicates $m$-length blocks $(m \geq 1)$ with Bob over error-free channels: classical or quantum. In the classical setting, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance ``confusion graph'' $G^{(m)}$. In the quantum setting, it depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of $G^{(m)}$. The behavior of the quantum advantage (ratio of classical and quantum rates) depends critically on $G^{(m)}$ which is shown to be sandwiched between $G^{\boxtimes m}$ ($m$-times strong product) and $G^{\lor m}$ ($m$-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$ and joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot,\cdot)$ such that $G^{(m)}$ equals either $G^{\boxtimes m}$ or $G^{\lor m}$. We study the behavior of the quantum advantage in the single-instance case and the asymptotic (in $m$) case for several classes of confusion graphs and demonstrate, e.g., that there exist problems where there is a quantum advantage in the single-instance rate but no quantum advantage in the asymptotic rate.</description>

      <title>Direct sum theorems beyond query complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in computer science is: Is it harder to solve $n$ instances independently than to solve them simultaneously? This question, known as the direct sum question or direct sum theorem, has been paid much attention in several research fields. Despite its importance, however, little has been discovered in many other research fields.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that extends to classical/quantum query complexity, PAC-learning for machine learning, statistical estimation theory, and more. Within this framework, we establish several fundamental direct sum theorems. The main contributions of this paper include: (i) establishing a complete characterization of the amortized query/oracle complexities, and (ii) proving tight direct sum theorems when the error is small. Note that in our framework, every oracle access needs to be performed \emph{classically} even in the quantum setting. This can be thought of one limitation of this work.
  As a direct consequence of our results, we obtain the following: (A) The first known asymptotic separation of the randomized query complexity. Specifically, we show that there is a function $f: \{0, 1\}^k \to \{0, 1\}$ and small error $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that solving $n$ instances simultaneously requires the query complexity $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{k})$ but solving one instance with the same error has the complexity $\tilde{\Omega}(k)$. In communication complexity this type of separation was previously given in~Feder, Kushilevitz, Naor and Nisan (1995). (B) The query complexity counterpart of the ``information = amortized communication" relation, one of the most influential results in communication complexity shown by Braverman and Rao (2011) and further investigated by Braverman (2015).
  We hope that our results will provide further interesting applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Spectral function of a bipolaron coupled to dispersive optical phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an efficient variational exact diagonalization method, we computed the electron removal spectral function within the framework of the Holstein-Hubbard model containing two electrons with opposite spins coupled to dispersive quantum optical phonons. Our primary focus was examining the interplay between phonon dispersion and Coulomb repulsion and their effects on the single-electron removal spectral function, relevant for the analysis of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Tuning the strengths of the electron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard interaction allows us to examine the evolution of the spectral properties of the system as it crosses over from a bound bipolaron to separate polarons. With increasing Hubbard repulsion, the decrease of the bipolaron binding energy results in the gradual downward shift of the polaron band - a low-frequency feature in the spectral function. Simultaneously, the intensity of the polaron band away from the center of the Brillouin zone diminishes until it remains non-zero only in its center as the bipolaron unbinds into two separate polarons. The spectral function is significantly influenced by phonon dispersion, particularly in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling. The sign of the curvature of the phonon band plays a crucial role in the distribution of spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Megastable quantization in generalized pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical particle in a harmonic potential gives rise to a continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite quantized energy levels. In recent years, classical non-Markovian wave-particle entities that materialize as walking droplets have been shown to exhibit various hydrodynamic quantum analogs, including quantization in a harmonic potential by displaying few coexisting limit cycle orbits. By considering a truncated-memory stroboscopic pilot-wave model of the system in the low dissipation regime, we obtain a classical harmonic oscillator perturbed by oscillatory non-conservative forces that displays countably infinite coexisting limit-cycle states, also known as \emph{megastability}. Using averaging techniques in the low-memory regime, we derive analytical approximations of the orbital radii, orbital frequency and Lyapunov energy function of this megastable spectrum, and further show average energy conservation along these quantized states. Our formalism extends to a general class of self-excited oscillators and can be used to construct megastable spectrum with different energy-frequency relations.</description>

      <title>Planon-modular fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary manifestation of near electrostatic field caused by macroscopic quantum shell effects in submicron hemispherical clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.</description>
