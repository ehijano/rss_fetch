      <title>PAS-Net: Physics-informed Adaptive Scale Deep Operator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear physical phenomena often show complex multiscale interactions; motivated by the principles of multiscale modeling in scientific computing, we propose PAS-Net, a physics-informed Adaptive-Scale Deep Operator Network for learning solution operators of nonlinear and singularly perturbed evolution PDEs with small parameters and localized features. Specifically, PAS-Net augments the trunk input in the physics informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) with a prescribed (or learnable) locally rescaled coordinate transformation centered at reference points. This addition introduces a multiscale feature embedding that acts as an architecture-independent preconditioner which improves the representation of localized, stiff, and multiscale dynamics. From an optimization perspective, the adaptive-scale embedding in PAS-Net modifies the geometry of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the neural network by increasing its smallest eigenvalue, which in turn improves spectral conditioning and accelerates gradient-based convergence. We further show that this adaptive-scale mechanism explicitly accelerates neural network training in approximating functions with steep transitions and strong asymptotic behavior, and we provide a rigorous proof of this function-approximation result within the finite-dimensional NTK matrix framework. We test the proposed PAS-Net on three different problems: (i) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, (ii) a nonlinear diffusion-reaction system with sharp spatial gradients, and (iii) a two-dimensional eikonal equation. The numerical results show that PAS-Net consistently achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than the standard DeepONet and PI-DeepONet models under a similar training cost.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of three-dimensional shapes of normal and disease-related erythrocytes from partial observations using multi-fidelity neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.</description>

      <title>jaxFMM: An Adaptive, GPU-Parallel Implementation of the Fast Multipole Method in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce jaxFMM, an open-source, adaptive, highly parallel point-charge Fast Multipole Method implementation for the Laplace kernel written in JAX. It is based on a non-uniform refinement strategy, which results in extremely concise and simple code. Benchmarks show that the algorithm performs well even for highly non-uniform charge distributions. JaxFMM already massively speeds up stray-field computations in micromagnetics and with JAX features like autodiff, novel applications such as inverse-design problems and machine-learning tasks can be tackled with ease in the future.</description>

      <title>A Full-Induction Magnetohydrodynamics Solver for Liquid Metal Fusion Blankets in Vertex-CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphysics modeling of liquid metal fusion blankets, which produce tritium and convert energy of neutrons created via fusion reactions into heat, is crucial for predicting performance, ensuring structural integrity, and optimizing energy production. While traditional blanket modeling of liquid metal flows during normal steady operating conditions commonly employs the inductionless approximation of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, transient scenarios, when the plasma-confining magnetic field varies on millisecond time scales, require a full-induction MHD approach that dynamically evolves the magnetic field via the time-dependent induction equation. This paper presents the formulation, implementation, and initial verification of a full-induction MHD solver integrated within the open-source Vertex-CFD framework, which aims to achieve tight multiphysics coupling, a flexible software design enabling easy extension and addition of physics models, and performance portability across computing platforms. The solver utilizes finite element spatial discretization, implicit Runge--Kutta time integration, and an inexact Newton method to solve the resulting discrete nonlinear system, leveraging Trilinos packages for efficient computation. Verification against selected benchmark problems demonstrates accuracy and robustness of the solver. Furthermore, when the solver is applied to an idealized blanket model in 2.5D and full 3D, results obtained with Vertex-CFD are in good agreement with recently published quasi-2D simulations. These findings establish a computational foundation for future simulations of transient MHD phenomena in liquid metal blankets with Vertex-CFD, and open avenues for future extensions and performance optimizations.</description>

      <title>Addressing the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field remains a demanding benchmark for numerical methods in numerical relativity, as it exhibits critical behavior at the boundary between dispersion and black hole formation. In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network approach to quantum optical state evolution beyond the Fock basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Constrained bilinear optimal control of reactive evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constrained bilinear optimal control of second-order linear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reaction term on the half line, where control arises as a time-dependent reaction coefficient and constraints are imposed on the state and control variables. These PDEs represent a wide range of physical phenomena in fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer. Existing computational methods for this type of control problems only consider constraints on the control variable and lack global convergence guarantee. In this paper, we propose a novel optimize-then-discretize framework for computing constrained bilinear optimal control with both state and control constraints. Unlike existing methods that derive optimality conditions directly from the PDE constraint, this framework first replaces the PDE constraint with an equivalent integral representation of the PDE solution and then derives optimality conditions for the reformulated problem. The integral representation, derived from the unified transform method, does not involve differential operators, and thus explicit expressions for necessary conditions of optimality can be derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for infinite-dimensional optimization. Discretizing the optimality conditions results in a system of finite-dimensional smooth nonlinear equations, which can be efficiently solved using existing algorithms with guaranteed global convergence at a quadratic rate. This is in contrast with discretize-then-optimize methods that discretize the PDE first and then solve the optimality conditions of the approximated finite-dimensional problem. Computational results for two applications, namely nuclear reactivity control and water quality treatment in a reactor, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Informed Method of Lines for Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid solver that fuses the dimensionality-reduction strengths of the Method of Lines (MOL) with the flexibility of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Instead of approximating spatial derivatives with fixed finite-difference stencils - whose truncation errors force extremely fine meshes - our method trains a neural network to represent the initial spatial profile and then employs automatic differentiation to obtain spectrally accurate gradients at arbitrary nodes. These high-fidelity derivatives define the right-hand side of the MOL-generated ordinary-differential system, and time integration is replaced with a secondary temporal PINN while spatial accuracy is retained without mesh refinement. The resulting "boundary-informed MOL-PINN" matches or surpasses conventional MOL in accuracy using an order of magnitude fewer collocation points, thereby shrinking memory footprints, lessening dependence on large data sets, and increasing complexity robustness. Because it relies only on automatic differentiation and standard optimizers, the framework extends naturally to linear and nonlinear PDEs in any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the collision operator in the lattice Boltzmann method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In transport theory, physical phenomena are well described using the Boltzmann equation, which is efficiently simulated and discretized with the lattice Boltzmann method. The collision step defines the microscopic molecules behavior, and thus the simulated physical phenomena. For complex phenomena, the collision step becomes complex as well. In this paper, we propose a framework to systematically decompose the collision step into individual collision rules. Each collision rule is easier to understand, thus a faster understanding of the whole is achieved. By inverting the process, i.e. composing multiple collision rules together, one can create novel collision steps, which can better describe the underlying complex phenomena. This framework's applications are manyfold, from both a theoretical and an application standpoint. Shown here is the decomposition of Robin boundary condition into Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, extending it to a partial Robin boundary condition, and semi-permeable reactive membranes.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</description>

      <title>Extending targeted phonon excitation to modulate bulk systems : a study on thermal conductivity of Boron Arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional thermal conductivity modulation approaches typically rely on nano-structural modifications and can only achieve irreversible alternation. Despite being a pioneering quantum strategy for dynamical and reversible thermal conductivity modulation, targeted phonon excitation has been confined to two-dimensional systems, and its effectiveness in three-dimensional systems remains unknown. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted phonon excitation for modulating the thermal conductivity in three-dimensional system by taking bulk boron arsenide (BAs) as a representative material. By combining first-principles calculations with the Boltzmann transport equation, an enhancement up to 2% and a suppression up to 35% relative to the intrinsic thermal conductivity were achieved through targeted phonon excitation. Notably, the modulation effect also exhibited an obvious dependence on excitation intensity, and an opposite modulation effect was observed for specific phonon frequency range. Computational analysis reveals that the non-monotonic modulation tendency under different excitation intensities stems from the competition between the increase in phonon population and the enhancement of phonon scattering, particularly through the reconfiguration of splitting (emission) processes in three-phonon scattering. This work extends the applicability of targeted phonon excitation to 3D systems, provides insights into phonon engineering mechanisms, and lays the foundation for dynamic thermal management and phonon devices.</description>

      <title>The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack growth but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker-Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics-the Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Performance of Tritium Process Monitors from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionization chamber-based, in-line tritium process monitors play an important part in determining the behavior of a tritium system. The one-liter detection volume monitor has been characterized well through experiment and to respond linearly to tritium concentrations for the range of $1 {\mu}Ci/m^3$ to $1 Ci/m^3$. Additionally, it has been shown to behave nonlinearly for low voltage on the central anode and low pressure of the carrier gas. A computational model was developed from first principles that successfully describes the behavior of the one-liter monitor for each of these regimes. Predictions from the model are compared to previously-collected experimental data in order to determine validity and tune the model. The model will be expanded to incorporate additional detector geometries and designs in the future.</description>

      <title>Effect of Misfit and Threading Dislocations on Surface Energies of PbTe-PbSe Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work quantifies the effect of misfit and threading dislocations on the surface (interfacial) energies of PbTe-PbSe interfaces, with the defect structures of the interfaces being obtained from atomistic and multiscale simulations of their manufacturing processes. Simulation results show that direct bonding produces semi-coherent interfaces with two-dimensional misfit dislocation networks, while heteroepitaxial processes produce complex three-dimensional dislocation structures with both misfit and threading dislocations. Surface energies at these interfaces were determined by computing the interaction energies across these interfaces. Compared with coherent interfaces, directly bonded interfaces exhibit up to ~23% lower surface energy, while the surface energies of epitaxially grown interfaces can be nearly 50% lower. The results demonstrate the significant effects of dislocations, which are unavoidable during the manufacturing processes of lattice mismatched heterostructures, on surface (interfacial) energy.</description>
