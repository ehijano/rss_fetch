      <title>Stellar Mergers or Truly Young? Intermediate-Age Stars on Highly-Radial Orbits in the Milky Way's Stellar Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the mass assembly history of the Milky Way relies on obtaining detailed measurements of the properties of many stars in the Galaxy, especially in the stellar halo. One of the most constraining quantities is stellar age, as it can shed light on the accretion time and quenching of star formation in merging satellites. However, obtaining reliable age estimates for large samples of halo stars is difficult. We report published ages of 120 subgiant halo stars with highly-radial orbits that likely belong to the debris of the $Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage$ (GES) galaxy. The majority of these halo stars are old, with an age distribution characterized by a median of 11.6~Gyr and 16$^{\rm th}$(84$^{\rm th}$) percentile of 10.5~(12.7)~Gyr. However, the distribution is skewed, with a tail of younger stars that span ages down to $\sim6$-$9$ Gyr. All highly-radial halo stars have chemical and kinematic/orbital quantities that associate them with the GES debris. Initial results suggest that these intermediate-age stars are not a product of mass transfer and/or stellar mergers, which can bias their age determination low. If this conclusion is upheld by upcoming spectro-photometric studies, then the presence of these stars will pose an important challenge for constraining the properties of the GES merger and the accretion history of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Formation of Large Circumstellar Discs in Multi-scale, ideal-MHD Simulations of Magnetically Critical Pre-stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of circumstellar discs is a critical step in the formation of stars and planets. Magnetic fields can strongly affect the evolution of angular momentum during prestellar core collapse, potentially leading to the failure of protostellar disc formation. This phenomenon, known as the magnetic braking catastrophe, has been observed in ideal-MHD simulations. In this work, we present results from ideal-MHD simulations of circumstellar disc formation from realistic initial conditions of strongly magnetised, massive cores with masses between $30 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and $300 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ resolved by zooming into Giant Molecular Clouds with masses $\sim 10^4 \ {\rm M}_\odot$ and initial mass-to-flux ratios $0.6 \le \mu_0 \le 3$. Due to the large turbulence caused by the non-axisymmetric gravitational collapse of the gas, the dominant vertical support of discs is turbulent motion, while magnetic and turbulent pressures contribute equally in the outer toroid. The magnetic field topology is extremely turbulent and incoherent, reducing the effect of magnetic braking by roughly one order of magnitude and leading to the formation of large Keplerian discs even in magnetically critical or near-critical cores. Only cores in GMCs with $\mu_0 &lt; 1$ fail to form discs. Instead, they collapse into a sheet-like structure and produce numerous low-mass stars. We also discuss a universal $B-\rho$ relation valid over a large range of scales from the GMC to massive cores, irrespective of the GMC magnetisation. This study differs from the vast literature on this topic which typically focus on smaller mass discs with idealised initial and boundary conditions, therefore providing insights into the initial conditions of massive prestellar core collapse and disc formation.</description>

      <title>The galaxy group merger origin of the Cloverleaf odd radio circle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORC) are a newly discovered class of extended faint radio sources of unknown origin. We report the first detection of diffuse X-ray gas at the location of a low-redshift ORC (z=0.046), known as Cloverleaf ORC. This observation was performed with the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. The physical extent of the diffuse X-ray emission corresponds to approximately a 230 kpc by 160 kpc region, lying perpendicular to the radio emission detected by ASKAP. The X-ray spectrum shows characteristics of thermal multi-phase gas with temperatures of $1.10\pm0.08$ keV and $0.22\pm0.01$ keV and a central density of $(4.9\pm0.6)\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that the Cloverleaf ORC resides in a low-mass galaxy group. Using velocity dispersion measurements in the optical, the halo mass of the galaxy group has been reported as $\sim1.6\times10^{13}$ M$_{sun}$. The presence of a high-velocity subgroup identified in optical data, the orientation of the BCG, the disturbed morphologies of galaxies towards the east of the Cloverleaf ORC, and the irregular morphology of the X-ray emission suggest that this system is undergoing a galaxy group merger. The radio power of the ORC could be explained by the shock reacceleration of fossil cosmic rays generated by a previous episode of black hole activity in the central active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>BANG-MaNGA: A census of kinematic discs and bulges across mass and star formation in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relevance of kinematically identified bulges, discs and their role relative to galaxy quenching. We utilize an analysis of the SDSS-MaNGA survey conducted with the GPU-based code BANG which simultaneously models galaxy photometry and kinematics to decompose galaxies into their structural components. Below M~1011 Msun, galaxies exhibit a wide range of dynamical properties, determined by the relative prominence of a dispersion-supported inner region and a rotationally-supported disc. Our analysis reveals a natural separation between these classes, with only a minor fraction of stellar mass retained by structures exhibiting intermediate dynamical support. When examining galaxies in terms of their star formation activity, an apparent decrease in rotational support is observed as they move below the star-forming main sequence. This behaviour is evident with luminosity-weighted tracers of kinematics, while it almost vanishes with mass-weighted tracers. Luminosity-weighted quantities not only capture differences in kinematics but also in the stellar population, potentially leading to biased interpretations of galaxy dynamical properties and quenching. Our findings suggest that quenching does not imply almost any structural transformation in galaxies below M~10^11 Msun. Processes as disc fading more likely account for observed differences in mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted galaxy properties; when the galactic disc ceases star formation, its mass-to-light ratio grows without any significant morphological transformation. The picture is remarkably different above M~10^11 Msun. Regardless of the tracer used, a substantial increase in galaxy dispersion support is observed along with a significant structural change. A different quenching mechanism, most likely associated with mergers, dominates. Notably, this mechanism is confined to a very limited range of high masses.</description>

      <title>Galactic disc heating by density granulation in fuzzy dark matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM), an attractive dark matter candidate comprising ultralight bosons (axions) with a particle mass $m_a\sim10^{-22}$ eV, is motivated by the small-scale challenges of cold dark matter and features a kpc-size de Broglie wavelength. Quantum wave interference inside an FDM halo gives rise to stochastically fluctuating density granulation; the resulting gravitational perturbations could drive significant disc thickening, providing a natural explanation for galactic thick discs. Here we present the first self-consistent simulations of FDM haloes and stellar discs, exploring $m_a=0.2-1.2\times10^{-22}$ eV and halo masses $M_\text{h} = 0.7-2.8\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Disc thickening is observed in all simulated systems. The disc heating rates are approximately constant in time and increase substantially with decreasing $m_a$, reaching $dh/dt \simeq 0.04$ ($0.4$) kpc Gyr$^{-1}$ and $d\sigma_z^2/dt \simeq4$ ($150$) km$^2$s$^{-2}$Gyr$^{-1}$ for $m_a=1.2$ ($0.2$) $\times10^{-22}$ eV and $M_\text{h} =7\times10^{10} \text{M}_\odot$, where $h$ is the disc scale height and $\sigma_z$ is the vertical velocity dispersion. These simulated heating rates agree within a factor of two with the theoretical estimates of Chiang et al., confirming that the rough estimate of Church et al. overpredicts the granulation-driven disc heating rate by two orders of magnitude. However, the simulation-inferred heating rates scale less steeply than the theoretically predicted relation $d\sigma^2_z/dt \propto m_a^{-3}$. Finally, we examine the applicability of the Fokker-Planck approximation in FDM granulation modelling and the robustness of the $m_a$ exclusion bound derived from the Galactic disc kinematics.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XXVII.The Size and Structure of Globular Cluster Systems and their Connection to Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the size and structure of globular clusters (GC) systems of 118 early-type galaxies from the NGVS, MATLAS, and ACSVCS surveys. Fitting S\'ersic profiles, we investigate the relationship between effective radii of GC systems ($R_{e, \rm gc}$) and galaxy properties. GC systems are 2--4 times more extended than host galaxies across the entire stellar mass range of our sample ($10^{8.3} &lt; M_* &lt; 10^{11.6}~M_{\odot}$). The relationship between $R_{e, \rm gc}$ and galaxy stellar mass exhibits a characteristic "knee" at a stellar mass of $M_p \simeq 10^{10.8}$, similar to galaxy $R_e$--stellar mass relationship. We present a new characterization of the traditional blue and red GC color sub-populations, describing them with respect to host galaxy $(g'-i')$ color ($\Delta_{gi}$): GCs with similar colors to their hosts have a "red" $\Delta_{gi}$, and those significantly bluer GCs have a "blue" $\Delta_{gi}$. The GC populations with red $\Delta_{gi}$, even in dwarf galaxies, are twice as extended as the stars, suggesting that formation or survival mechanisms favor the outer regions. We find a tight correlation between $R_{e, \rm gc}$ and the total number of GCs, with intrinsic scatter $\lesssim 0.1$ dex spanning two and three orders of magnitude in size and number, respectively. This holds for both red and blue subpopulations, albeit with different slopes. Assuming that $N_{GC, Total}$ correlates with $M_{200}$, we find that the red GC systems have effective radii of roughly 1-5\% $R_{\rm 200}$, while the blue GC systems in massive galaxies can have sizes as large as $\sim$10\% $R_{\rm 200}$. Environmental dependence on $R_{e, \rm gc}$ is also found, with lower density environments exhibiting more extended GC systems at fixed mass.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Scaling Relations between the Dark Matter Halo Mass and Observables from Generalised Profiles II: Intracluster Gas Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between a cluster's structural configuration and observable measures of its gas emission that can be obtained in X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) surveys. We present an analytic model for the intracluster gas density profile: parameterised by the dark matter halo's inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, the concentration, $c$, the gas profile's inner logarithmic density slope, $\varepsilon$, the dilution, $d$, and the gas fraction, $\eta$, normalised to cosmological content. We predict four probes of the gas emission: the emission-weighted, $T_\mathrm{X}$, and mean gas mass-weighted, $T_\mathrm{m_g}$, temperatures, and the spherically, $Y_\mathrm{sph}$, and cylindrically, $Y_\mathrm{cyl}$, integrated Compton parameters. Over a parameter space of clusters, we constrain the X-ray temperature scaling relations, $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{X}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{X}$, within $57.3\%$ and $41.6\%$, and $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{m_g}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{m_g}$, within $25.7\%$ and $7.0\%$, all respectively. When excising the cluster's core, the $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{X}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{X}$ relations are further constrained, to within $31.3\%$ and $17.1\%$, respectively. Similarly, we constrain the SZ scaling relations, $M_{200} - Y_\mathrm{sph}$ and $M_{500} - Y_\mathrm{sph}$, within $31.1\%$ and $17.7\%$, and $M_{200} - Y_\mathrm{cyl}$ and $M_{500} - Y_\mathrm{cyl}$, within $25.2\%$ and $22.0\%$, all respectively. The temperature observable $T_\mathrm{m_g}$ places the strongest constraint on the halo mass, whilst $T_\mathrm{X}$ is more sensitive to the parameter space. The SZ constraints are sensitive to the gas fraction, whilst insensitive to the form of the gas profile itself. In all cases, the halo mass is recovered with an uncertainty that suggests the cluster's structural profiles only contribute a minor uncertainty in its scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Star Formation in Galaxy Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs based on the isolated galaxy pair sample derived from the SDSS survey. By comparing the star formation rate between late-type galaxies in galaxy pairs and those in the isolated environment, we detect the signal of star formation suppression in galaxy pairs at $d_p &lt; 100$kpc and $200$kpc$ &lt; d_p &lt; 350$kpc. The occurrence of star formation suppression in these late-type galaxies requires their companion galaxies to have an early-type morphology ($n_s &gt; 2.5$). Star formation suppression in wide galaxy pairs with $200$kpc$ &lt; d_p &lt; 350$kpc mainly occurs in massive late-type galaxies, while in close galaxy pairs with $d_p &lt; 100$kpc, it only appears in late-type galaxies with a massive companion ( $\log M_\star &gt; 11.0$), nearly independent of their own stellar mass. Based on these findings, we infer that star formation suppression in wide galaxy pairs is actually a result of galaxy conformity, while in close galaxy pairs, it stems from the influence of hot circum-galactic medium surrounding companion galaxies.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of luminosity function from flux-limited samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and of their environment are encoded in their luminosity function and cosmic formation rate. They are usually recovered from a flux-limited sample based on Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method. However, this method is based on the assumption that the luminosity is independent of the redshift. Observationally, if correlated, people use nonparametric $\tau$ statistical method to remove this correlation through the transformation, $L^{\prime}=L/g(z)$, where $z$ is the burst redshift, and $g(z)=(1+z)^{k}$ parameterizes the underlying luminosity evolution. However, the application of this method to different observations could result in very different luminosity functions. By the means of Monte Carlo simulation, in this paper, we demonstrate that the origin of an observed correlation, measured by the $\tau$ statistical method, is a complex combination of multiple factors when the underlying data are correlated. Thus, in this case, it is difficult to unbiasedly reconstruct the underlying population distribution from a truncated sample, unless the detailed information of the intrinsic correlation is accurately known in advance. In addition, we argue that an intrinsic correlation between luminosity function and formation rate is unlikely eliminated by a misconfigured transformation, and the $g(z)$, derived from a truncated sample with the $\tau$ statistical method, does not necessarily represent its underlying luminosity evolution.</description>

      <title>E-XQR-30: The evolution of MgII, CII and OI across 2&lt;z&lt;6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intervening metal absorbers in quasar spectra at $z &gt; 6$ can be used as probes to study the chemical enrichment of the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This work presents the comoving line densities ($dn/dX$) of low ionisation absorbers, namely, Mg II (2796\r{A}), C II (1334\r{A}) and O I (1302\r{A}) across $2 &lt;z &lt; 6$ using the E-XQR-30 metal absorber catalog prepared from 42 XSHOOTER quasar spectra at $5.8 &lt; z &lt; 6.6$. Here, we analyse 280 Mg II ($1.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.4$), 22 C II ($5.2 &lt; z &lt; 6.4$) and 10 O I ($5.3 &lt; z &lt; 6.4$) intervening absorbers, thereby building up on previous studies with improved sensitivity of 50% completeness at an equivalent width of $W &gt; 0.03$\r{A}. For the first time, we present the comoving line densities of 131 weak ($W &lt; 0.3$\r{A}) intervening Mg II absorbers at $1.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.4$ which exhibit constant evolution with redshift similar to medium ($0.3 &lt; W &lt; 1.0$\r{A}) absorbers. However, the cosmic mass density of Mg II - dominated by strong Mg II systems - traces the evolution of global star formation history from redshift 1.9 to 5.5. E-XQR-30 also increases the absorption path length by a factor of 50% for C II and O I whose line densities show a rising trend towards $z &gt; 5$, in agreement with previous works. In the context of a decline in metal enrichment of the Universe at $z &gt; 5$, the overall evolution in the incidence rates of absorption systems can be explained by a weak - possibly soft fluctuating - UV background. Our results, thereby, provide evidence for a late reionization continuing to occur in metal-enriched and therefore, biased regions in the Universe.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$ Time Delays of AGNs from the Zwicky Transcient Facility Broadband Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work on broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), we proposed the ICCF-Cut process to obtain the time lags of H$\alpha$ emission line from two broadband lightcurves via subtracting the continuum emission from the line band. Extending the work, we enlarge our sample to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database. We adopt two criteria to select 123 type 1 AGNs with sufficient variability and smooth lightcurves from 3537 AGNs at $z&lt;0.09$ with more than 100 epoch observations in the $g$ and $r$ bands from the ZTF database. We calculate the H$\alpha$ time lags for 23 of them which have previous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) results using ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN and $\chi ^2$ methods. Our obtained H$\alpha$ time lags are slightly larger than the H$\beta$ time lags, which is consistent with the previous SRM results and the theoretical model of the AGN broad line region. The comparisons between SRM and PRM lag distributions and between the subtracted emission line lightcurves indicate that after selecting AGNs with the two criteria, combining the ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN and $\chi^2$ methods provides an efficient way to get the reliable H$\alpha$ lags from the broadband PRM. Such techniques can be used to estimate the black hole masses of a large sample of AGNs in the large multi-epoch photometric sky surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the survey from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) in the near future.</description>

      <title>Virial Black Hole Masses for AGNs behind the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the spectroscopic data collected by the Magellanic Quasars Survey (MQS) as well as the photometric V- and I-band data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to measure the physical parameters for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) located behind the Magellanic Clouds. The flux-uncalibrated MQS spectra were obtained with the 4-m Anglo-Australian Telescope and the AAOmega spectroscope (R=1300) in a typical ~1.5-hour visit. They span a spectral range of 3700-8500 Angstroms and have S/N ratios in a range of 3-300. We report the discovery and observational properties of 161 AGNs in this footprint, which expands the total number of spectroscopically confirmed AGNs by MQS to 919. After converting the OGLE mean magnitudes to the monochromatic luminosities at 5100 Angstroms, 3000 Angstroms, and 1350 Angstroms, we reliably measured the black hole masses for 165 out of 919 AGNs. The remaining physical parameters we provide are the bolometric luminosities and the Eddington ratios. A fraction of these AGNs have been observed by the OGLE survey since 1997 (all of them since 2001), enabling studies of correlations between their variability and physical parameters.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec Spectroscopy of the Remarkable Bright Galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at Redshift 12.34</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We spectroscopically confirm the $M_{\rm UV} = -20.5$ mag galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 to be at redshift $z=12.34$. The source was selected via NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data, providing the first evidence of a surprising abundance of bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. The NIRSpec PRISM spectrum is remarkable and unlike any local analog. It shows significant detections of N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III lines, and the first detection in a high-redshift object of the O III Bowen fluorescence line at 3133 {\AA} rest-frame. The prominent C IV line with rest-frame equivalent width (EW) $\sim 46$ {\AA} puts GHZ2 in the category of extreme C IV emitters characterised by hard radiation fields. GHZ2 displays UV lines with EWs that are only found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or composite objects at low/intermediate redshifts, and UV line-intensity ratios that are compatible both with AGNs and star formation in a low-metallicity environment. The nondetection of the very high-ionization lines [Ne IV] and [Ne V], and the remarkable similarity between GHZ2 and other known C IV emitters, favors a scenario in which the high ionizing output is due to very low metallicity, massive stars forming in a dense environment. We estimate a metallicity $\lesssim 0.1 Z/{\rm Z}_{\odot}$, a high ionization parameter logU $&gt;$ -2, a N/O abundance 4--5 times the solar value, and a subsolar C/O ratio similar to the recently discovered class of nitrogen-enhanced objects at high redshift. Considering its abundance patterns and the high stellar mass density ($10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$), GHZ2 is an ideal formation site for the progenitors of today's globular clusters. The remarkable brightness of GHZ2 makes it a "Rosetta stone" for understanding the physics of galaxy formation within just 360 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Detection of ionized hydrogen and oxygen from a very luminous and young galaxy 13.4 billion years ago</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early universe (&lt; 500 Myrs after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy formation models and whose physical properties remain to be fully understood. Insight into the internal physics of galaxies is captured best via observations of excited-state atomic transitions of ionized gas, but beyond z~7-9, the brightest spectral signatures are redshifted into the mid-infrared regime, where observations are increasingly more difficult. Here, we present the first detection of a hydrogen recombination line (H{\alpha}) and doubly-ionized oxygen ([OIII]4959,5007{\AA}) at z&gt;10 using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument, MIRI. These detections place the bright galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at z=12.33+/-0.02, making it the most distant astronomical object with direct spectroscopic detection of these lines and the brightest confirmed object at this epoch. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primeval galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe and likely driven by compact, young (&lt;30 Myr) star formation. Its oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. This study confirms the unique conditions of the brightest and most distant galaxies recently discovered by JWST and the huge potential of mid-IR observations to characterize these systems, opening a range of new possibilities in the study of the very early Universe.</description>

      <title>First evidence of a connection between cluster-scale diffuse radio emission in cool-core galaxy clusters and sloshing features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio observations of a few cool-core galaxy clusters have revealed the presence of diffuse emission on cluster scales, similar to what was found in merging clusters in the form of radio halos. These sources might suggest that a minor merger, while not sufficiently energetic to disrupt the cool core, could still trigger particle acceleration in the intracluster medium on scales of hundreds of kpc. We observed with LOFAR at 144 MHz a sample of twelve cool-core galaxy clusters presenting some level of dynamical disturbances, according to X-ray data. We also performed a systematic search of cold fronts in these clusters, re-analysing archival Chandra data. The clusters PSZ1G139.61+24, A1068 (new detection), MS 1455.0+2232, and RX J1720.1+2638 present diffuse radio emission on a cluster scale. This emission is characterised by a double component: a central mini-halo confined by cold fronts and diffuse emission on larger scales, whose radio power at 144 MHz is comparable to that of radio halos detected in merging systems. The cold fronts in A1068 are a new detection. We also found a candidate plasma depletion layer in this cluster. No sloshing features are found in the other eight clusters. Two of them present a mini-halo, with diffuse radio emission confined to the cluster core. We also found a new candidate mini-halo. Whereas, for the remaining five clusters, we did not detect halo-like emission. For clusters without cluster-scale halos, we derived upper limits to the radio halo power. We found that cluster-scale diffuse radio emission is not present in all cool-core clusters when observed at a low frequency, but it is correlated to the presence of cold fronts. This morphology requires a specific configuration of the merger and so it puts some constraints on the turbulence, which deserves to be investigated in the future with theoretical works.</description>

      <title>The Fermi/eROSITA Bubbles: A look into the nuclear outflow from the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic outflows are ubiquitous in galaxies containing active star formation or supermassive black hole activity. The presence of a large-scale outflow from the center of our own Galaxy was confirmed after the discovery of two large ($\sim 8-10$ kpc) \gamma-ray bubbles using the \textit{Fermi-LAT} telescope. These bubbles, known as the Fermi Bubbles, are highly symmetric about the Galactic disk as well as around the Galactic rotation axis and appear to emanate from the center of our Galaxy. The sharp edges of these bubbles suggest that they are related to the Galactic outflow. These bubbles are surrounded by two even bigger ($\sim 12-14$ kpc) X-ray structures, known as the eROSITA bubbles. Together, they represent the characteristics of an outflow from the Galaxy into the circumgalactic medium. Multi-wavelength observations such as in radio, microwave, and UV toward the Fermi Bubbles have provided us with much information in the last decade. However, the origin and the nature of these bubbles remain elusive. In this review, I summarize the observations related to the Fermi/eROSITA Bubbles at different scales and wavelengths, and give a brief overview of our current understanding of them.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from Main Sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties; namely, the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red giant branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with ages derived from other techniques for a sample of open clusters and main-sequence stars with asteroseismic age measurements. We also compare dynamical age estimates for stellar samples from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass-independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Consistent extinction model for type Ia supernovae in Cepheid-based calibration galaxies and its impact on $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most recent SH0ES measurement of the Hubble constant, based on type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ compilation, employs corrections of supernova peak magnitudes which effectively accounts for extinction in the supernova host galaxies. These corrections are estimated using a probabilistic model which is trained on Hubble flow (z&gt;0.03) supernovae and extrapolated to the calibration galaxies (those with observed Cepheid distances). By comparing the corrected peak magnitudes to distance moduli from Cepheids, we show that this standard approach underestimates the brightness of reddened supernovae in the high stellar-mass ($M_{\star}&gt;10^{10}M_{\odot}$) calibration galaxies. This can be traced back to the fact that for these galaxies, a low total-to-selective extinction coefficient (R_B~3) is assumed, while for the low stellar-mass analogues a more standard R_B~4 is assumed. We propose a minimalistic modification of the Pantheon+ extinction model in order to alleviate this systematic effect. The modification is twofold and it involves: (i) the same, Milky Way-like distribution of R_B in all calibration galaxies (with mean R_B of 4.3 -- consistent with the extinction curve used for colour corrections of the Cepheids -- and scatter 0.4) and (ii) a modified shape of the E(B-V) reddening distribution while keeping the same effective slope of the supernova peak magnitude-colour relation and the same mean E(B-V) reddening as measured for supernovae in the Hubble flow. We show that this new approach yields a significantly better fit ($\Delta$BIC=-11) to the calibration data and results in a lower value of the derived Hubble constant through a stronger extinction correction of supernovae in the calibration galaxies. Our result is $H_{0}=70.5\pm1$ km/s/Mpc implying a reduction of the tension with the Planck $H_{0}$ measurement assuming a flat LCDM cosmology from $5.2\sigma$ to $2.8\sigma$.</description>

Abstract: Powerful winds at accretion-disk scales have been observed in the past 20 years in many AGN. These are the so-called ultrafast outflows (UFOs). Outflows are intimately related to mass accretion through the conservation of angular momentum, and they are therefore a key ingredient of most accretion disk models around black holes (BHs). Nuclear winds and outflows can also provide the feedback that regulates the joint BH and galaxy growth. We reconsidered UFO observations in the framework of disk-wind scenarios, both magnetohydrodynamic disk winds and radiatively driven winds. We studied the statistical properties of observed UFOs from the literature and derived the distribution functions of the ratio $\bar \omega$ of the mass-outflow and -inflow rates and the ratio $\lambda_w$ of the mass-outflow and the Eddington accretion rates. We studied the links between $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ and $\lambda={L_{bol}}/{L_{Edd}}$. We derived the typical wind-activity history in our sources by assuming that it can be statistically described by population functions. We find that the distribution functions of $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ can be described as power laws above some thresholds, suggesting that there may be many wind subevents for each major wind event in each AGN activity cycle, which is a fractal behavior. We then introduced a cellular automaton to investigate how the dynamical properties of an idealized disk-wind system change following the introduction of feedback rules. We find that without feedback, the system is overcritical. Conversely, when feedback is present, regardless of whether it is magnetic or radiation driven, the system can be driven toward a self-organized critical state.Our results corroborate the hypothesis that AGN feedback is a necessary key ingredient in disk-wind systems, and following this, in shaping the coevolution of galaxies and supermassive BHs.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we compare the structural parameters of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) to those of other dwarf galaxies and investigate whether UDGs form a distinct population. We observed deep $u'$-, $g'$-, and $r'$-band images (maximum limiting surface brightness [3$\sigma$, $10"\times10"$] $u'$ and $g'$: $\mathrm{\approx 30\,mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$; $r'$: $\mathrm{\approx 29\,mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$) of A1656 (Coma cluster) and A262 with the Wendelstein Wide Field Imager at the 2.1 m-Fraunhofer Wendelstein Telescope on the Wendelstein Observatory. We measure $u'-g'$ and $g'-r'$ colors and structural parameters using parametric fitting of tens of thousands of potential UDGs and other dwarf galaxies. Cluster members are identified and separated from diffuse background galaxies based on red sequence membership and location in the $u'-g'$ vs. $g'-r'$ color-color diagram. We find 11 UDGs in A262 and 48 UDGs in A1656. The latter is six times more than van Dokkum et al. found in the overlapping region. By comparing the structural parameters of UDGs to non-UDGs in our sample and to spheroidals from the literature, we do not find any separation in all tested parameter spaces. Instead, UDGs form the diffuse end of the already well-known spheroidal population and slightly extend it. Furthermore, we find that the UDG definition used by Koda et al. and Yagi et al. mainly extends the definition by van Dokkum et al. toward ordinary spheroidals.</description>

      <title>Outflows Driven from a Magnetic Pseudodisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least thousands of au) is a contrast to typical disk sizes ($\sim 10-100$ au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.</description>

      <title>Massive Debris Disks May Hinder Secular Stirring by Planetary Companions: An Analytic Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debris disks or exo-Kuiper belts, detected through their thermal or scattered emission from their dusty components, are ubiquitous around main-sequence stars. Since dust grains are short-lived, their sustained presence is thought to require dynamical excitation, i.e., "stirring", of a massive reservoir of large planetesimals, such that mutual collisions are violent enough to continually supply fresh dust. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain debris disk stirring, with the commonly accepted being long-term, secular planet-debris disk interactions. However, while effective, existing planet-stirring models are rudimentary; namely, they ignore the (self-)gravity of the disk, treating it as a massless reservoir of planetesimals. Here, using a simple analytical model, we investigate the secular interactions between eccentric planets and massive, external debris disks. We demonstrate that the disk gravity drives fast apsidal precession of both planetesimal and planetary orbits, which, depending on the system parameters, may well exceed the planet-induced precession rate of planetesimals. This results in strong suppression of planetesimal eccentricities and thus relative collisional velocities throughout the disk, often by more than an order of magnitude when compared to massless disk models. We thus show that massive debris disks may hinder secular stirring by eccentric planets orbiting near, e.g., the disk's inner edge, provided the disk is more massive than the planet. We provide simple analytic formulae to describe these effects. Finally, we show that these findings have important implications for planet inferences in debris-bearing systems, as well as for constraining the total masses of debris disks (as done for $\beta$ Pic).</description>
