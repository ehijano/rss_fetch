      <title>OrCAS: Origins, Compositions, and Atmospheres of Sub-neptunes. I. Survey Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes - volatile-rich exoplanets smaller than Neptune - are intrinsically the most common type of planet known. However, the formation and nature of these objects, as well as the distinctions between sub-classes (if any), remain unclear. Two powerful tools to tease out the secrets of these worlds are measurements of (i) atmospheric composition and structure revealed by transit and/or eclipse spectroscopy, and (ii) mass, radius, and density revealed by transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy. Here we present OrCAS, a survey to better elucidate the origins, compositions, and atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. This radial velocity survey uses a repeatable, quantifiable metric to select targets suitable for subsequent transmission spectroscopy and address key science themes about the atmospheric &amp; internal compositions and architectures of these systems. Our survey targets 26 systems with transiting sub-Neptune planet candidates, with the overarching goal of increasing the sample of such planets suitable for subsequent atmospheric characterization. This paper lays out our survey's science goals, defines our target prioritization metric, and performs light-curve fits and statistical validation using existing TESS photometry and ground-based follow-up observations. Our survey serves to continue expanding the sample of small exoplanets with well-measured properties orbiting nearby bright stars, ensuring fruitful studies of these systems for many years to come.</description>

      <title>Water-rich sub-Neptunes and rocky super Earths around different Stars: Radii shaped by Volatile Partitioning, Formation, and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii has been compiled. It can be used to test the prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes by planet formation theory. We want to find out whether this water reservoir is included in photoevaporative winds and how much of it can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or complete segregation. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is best matched under the mixed assumption without water sequestration to the interior. We quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass. Fractionation is not found to significantly alter the composition of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. In contrast, water sequestration has a profound effect on the radius evolution and compositional budget of the planets. The model predicts the preservation of large quantities of water even if the gaseous envelope is lost. Planets with corresponding bulk densities are not observed in comparably large numbers. By combining formation and evolution model, we probe a parameter space favored by core accretion theory. We conclude that the dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps for comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction.

      <title>A possible misaligned orbit for the young planet AU Mic c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AU Microscopii planetary system is only 24 Myr old, and its geometry may provide clues about the early dynamical history of planetary systems. Here, we present the first measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the warm sub-Neptune AU\,Mic\,c, using two transits observed simultaneously with VLT/ESPRESSO, CHEOPS, and NGTS. After correcting for flares and for the magnetic activity of the host star, and accounting for transit-timing variations, we find the sky-projected spin-orbit angle of planet c to be in the range $\lambda_c=67.8_{-49.0}^{+31.7}$ degrees (1-$\sigma$). We examine the possibility that planet c is misaligned with respect to the orbit of the inner planet b ($\lambda_b=-2.96_{-10.30}^{+10.44}$ degrees), and the equatorial plane of the host star, and discuss scenarios that could explain both this and the planet's high density, including secular interactions with other bodies in the system or a giant impact. We note that a significantly misaligned orbit for planet c is in some degree of tension with the dynamical stability of the system, and with the fact that we see both planets in transit, though these arguments alone do not preclude such an orbit. Further observations would be highly desirable to constrain the spin-orbit angle of planet c more precisely.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the conundrum of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert. A new approach that incorporates stellar properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exoplanets has led to the identification of intriguing patterns in their distributions, one of which is the so-called sub-Jovian and Neptune desert. The occurrence rate of Neptunian exoplanets with an orbital period $P\lesssim 4$ days sharply decreases in this region in period-radius and period-mass space. We present a novel approach to delineating the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert by considering the incident stellar flux $F$ on the planetary surface as a key parameter instead of the traditional orbital period of the planets. Through this change of perspective, we demonstrate that the incident flux still exhibits a paucity of highly irradiated Neptunes, but also captures the proximity to the host star and the intensity of stellar radiation. Leveraging a dataset of confirmed exoplanets, we performed a systematic analysis to map the boundaries of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert in the $(F,R_p)$ and $(F,M_p)$ diagrams, with $R_p$ and $M_p$ corresponding to the planetary radius and mass, respectively. By using statistical techniques and fitting procedures, we derived analytical expressions for these boundaries that offer valuable insights into the underlying physical mechanisms governing the dearth of Neptunian planets in close proximity to their host stars. We find that the upper and lower bounds of the desert are well described by a power-law model in the $(F,R_p)$ and $(F,M_p)$ planes. We also obtain the planetary mass-radius relations for each boundary by combining the retrieved analytic expressions in the two planes. This work contributes to advancing our knowledge of exoplanet demographics and to refining theoretical models of planetary formation and evolution within the context of the sub-Jovian and Neptune desert.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Did the terrestrial planets of the Solar System form by pebble accretion?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17043v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morbidelli, Kleine &amp; Nimmo (2024) (MKN) recently published a critical analysis on whether the terrestrial planets in the Solar System formed by rapid pebble accretion or by the classical route of multiple giant impacts between planetary embryos after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. They arrive at the conclusion that the terrestrial planets did not form by pebble accretion. Although we welcome debate on this topic, we want to emphasize here several points that we disagree on. We will not address in detail every claim made in MKN, but rather stick to four main points. Our conclusion is that pebble accretion remains a viable mechanism to drive significant growth of protoplanets in the protoplanetary disc, with as much as 70% of Earth formed by pebble accretion. This rapid growth phase must nevertheless have been followed by an extended period of collisional growth after the end of the protoplanetary disc phase, likely culminating with the moon-forming giant impact. We emphasize here an important recent result from Olson &amp; Sharp (2023), namely that significant growth by pebble accretion can be reconciled with the Hf-W decay system even for a canonical moon-forming giant impact with a Mars-mass protoplanet and a low equilibration efficiency - a more massive impactor, as proposed in Johansen et al. (2023), is not necessary. Given that terrestrial planet formation naturally involves both pebble accretion and a combination of small and large impactors, this challenges the very notion of making an either/or distinction between the classical collision model and the pebble accretion model.</description>

      <title>Boulder migration in the Khonsu region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: European Space Agency's Rosetta mission is the only space mission that performed long-term monitoring of comet at close distances. Its over two years' rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko revealed diverse evolutionary processes of the cometary nucleus. One of the most striking events is the migration of a 30-m boulder in the southern hemisphere region of Khonsu. Previous works found the boulder's 140-m displacement occurred during the three months from August to October 2015, and several triggering mechanisms were proposed, including outburst at the boulder site, seismic vibrations from nearby activities, or surface erosion of the slope beneath the boulder. In this work, we further analyze this impressive event by analysing imaging data from Rosetta's OSIRIS camera. We constrained the boulder's migration time to within 14 hours and derived a detailed timeline of the boulder migration event and local dust activities. High-resolution thermophysical modelling shows significant dichotomy in the thermal history of the boulder's southern and northern sides, which could have triggered or facilitated its migration via its own volatile activity.</description>

      <title>Secret of Longevity: Protoplanetary Disks as a Source of Gas in Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are generally thought to dissipate within several Myr, recent observations have revealed gas in debris disks. The origin of this gas remains uncertain, with one possibility being the unexpectedly long survival of PPDs (the primordial-origin scenario). To explore the plausibility of this scenario, we conduct 1D disk evolution simulations, varying parameters like stellar mass, disk mass, turbulent stress, and magnetohydrodynamic winds, while incorporating stellar evolution to account for time-varying photoevaporation rates. Our focus is on disks where small grains are depleted, as these are potentially long-lived due to reduced far-ultraviolet photoevaporation. Our results show that gas in these disks can survive beyond 10 Myr regardless of the stellar mass, provided they are initially massive ($M_{\mathrm{disk}}\approx 0.1M_*$) with relatively weak turbulent stress ($\alpha \ll 10^{-2}$). The longest lifetimes are consistently found for $M_* = 2 M_{\odot}$ across a wide parameter space, with gas typically persisting at $\sim 10$--$10^3 \mathrm{au}$. Roughly estimated CO masses for these disks fall within the observed range for the most massive gas-rich debris disks around early A stars. These alignments support the plausibility of the primordial-origin scenario. Additionally, our model predicts that accretion persists for as long as the disk survives, which could explain the accretion signatures detected in old disks hosted by low-mass stars, including Peter Pan disks. Our finding also suggests that ongoing accretion may exist in gas-rich debris disks. Thus, searching for accretion signatures could be a key factor to identifying the origin of gas in debris disks.</description>

      <title>A link between rocky exoplanet composition and stellar age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interior compositions are key for our understanding of Earth-like exoplanets. The composition of the core can influence the presence of a magnetic dynamo and the strength of gravity on the planetary surface, both of which heavily impact thermal and possible biological processes and thus the habitability for life and its evolution on the planet. However, detailed measurements of the planetary interiors are extremely challenging for small exoplanets, and existing data suggest a wide diversity in planet compositions. Hitherto, only certain photospheric chemical abundances of the host stars have been considered as tracers to explain the diversity of exoplanet compositions. Here we present a homogeneous analysis of stars hosting rocky exoplanets, with ages between 2 and 14 Gyr, revealing a correlation between rocky exoplanet compositions and the ages of the planetary systems. Denser rocky planets are found around younger stars. This suggests that the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets can be linked to the ages of their host stars. We interpret this to be a result of chemical evolution of stars in the Milky Way, which modifies the material out of which stars and planets form. The results imply that rocky planets which form today, at similar galactocentric radii, may have different formation conditions, and thus different properties than planets which formed several billion years ago, such as the Earth.</description>

      <title>Gas dynamics around a Jupiter mass planet: II. Chemical evolution of circumplanetary material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an ongoing effort to understand planet formation the link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of resulting planets have long been a subject of interest. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-massed planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small, co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $\sim 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulfur carrying ices: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and H$_2$S are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species like CS, SO, and SO$_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, CS, and H$_2$CS in our model and find that their values are consistent with previous observational studies.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Field Theory Applied to Planetesimal Formation I: Freely Streaming Dust Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation in the solar system was started when the first planetesimals were formed from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. Numerical simulations of this process, especially in the framework of streaming instability, produce various power laws for the initial mass function for planetesimals. While recent advances have shed light on turbulence and its role in particle clustering, a comprehensive theoretical framework linking turbulence characteristics to particle cluster properties and planetesimal mass function remains incomplete. Recently, a kinetic field theory for ensembles of point-like classical particles in or out of equilibrium has been applied to cosmic structure formation. This theory encodes the dynamics of a classical particle ensemble by a generating functional specified by the initial probability distribution of particles in phase space and their equations of motion. Here, we apply kinetic field theory to planetesimal formation. A model for the initial probability distribution of dust particles in phase space is obtained from a quasi-initial state for a three-dimensional streaming-instability simulation that is a particle distribution with velocities for gas and particles from the Nakagawa relations. The equations of motion are chosen for the simplest case of freely streaming particles. We calculate the non-linearly evolved density power spectrum of dust particles and find that it develops a universal $k^{-3}$ tail at small scales, suggesting scale-invariant structure formation below a characteristic and time-dependent length scale. Thus, the KFT analysis indicates that the initial state for streaming instability simulations does not impose a constraint on structure evolution during planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>Validating the Orbital Periods of the Coolest TESS Exoplanet Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the resulting eclipse causes an observable decrease in stellar flux, and when multiple such transits are detected, the orbital period of the exoplanet can be determined. Over the past six years, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered thousands of potential planets by this method, mostly with short orbital periods, although some have longer reported values over one hundred days. These long orbital periods, however, are note easy to confirm due to frequent lengthy data gaps. Here we show that while the majority of these long period candidates likely have periods much shorter than reported, there are a sizable number of TESS candidates with true long periods. These candidates generally only have two reported transits, but the periods of duo-transits like this, and even candidates with three or more transits, can be confirmed if the data rules out all possible shorter period aliases. Using TESS data, we confirm long orbital periods for nine candidate planets, and present five others that are likely long period. Due to their long periods, these planets will have relatively cool equilibrium temperatures, and may be more likely to host exomoons or rings. We present these TOIs, along with a variety of small corrections to other TESS orbital periods and three planet candidates with possible transit timing variations, with the goal of refining the TESS data set and enabling future research with respect to cool transiting planets.</description>

      <title>Tungsten isotope evolution during Earth's formation and new constraints on the viability of accretion simulations</title>

Abstract: The Hf-W isotopic system is the reference chronometer for determining the chronology of Earth's accretion and differentiation. However, its results depend strongly on uncertain parameters, including the extent of metal-silicate equilibration and the siderophility of tungsten. Here we show that a multistage core-formation model based on N-body accretion simulations, element mass balance and metal-silicate partitioning, largely eliminates these uncertainties. We modified the original model of Rubie et al. (2015) by including (1) smoothed particle hydrodynamics estimates of the depth of melting caused by giant impacts and (2) the isotopic evolution of 182W. We applied two metal-silicate fractionation mechanisms: one when the metal delivered by the cores of large impactors equilibrates with only a small fraction of the impact-induced magma pond and the other when metal delivered by small impactors emulsifies in global magma oceans before undergoing progressive segregation. The latter is crucial for fitting the W abundance and 182W anomaly of Earth's mantle. In addition, we show, for the first time, that the duration of magma ocean solidification has a major effect on Earth's tungsten isotope anomaly. We re-evaluate the six Grand Tack N-body simulations of Rubie et al. (2015). Only one reproduces epsilon182W=1.9+/-0.1 of Earth's mantle, otherwise accretion is either too fast or too slow. Depending on the characteristics of the giant impacts, results predict that the Moon formed either 143-183 Myr or 53-62 Myr after the start of the solar system. Thus, independent evaluations of the Moon's age provide an additional constraint on the validity of accretion simulations.</description>

      <title>Searching for star-planet interactions in GJ 486 at radio wavelengths with the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17689v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for radio emission from star-planet interactions in the M-dwarf system GJ~486, which hosts an Earth-like planet. We observed the GJ~486 system with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) from 550 to 750 MHz in nine different epochs, between October 2021 and February 2022, covering almost all orbital phases of GJ~486 b from different orbital cycles. We obtained radio images and dynamic spectra of the total and circularly polarized intensity for each individual epoch We do not detect any quiescent radio emission in any epoch above 3$\sigma$. Similarly, we do not detect any bursty emission in our dynamic spectra.
  While we cannot completely rule out that the absence of a radio detection is due to time variability of the radio emission, or to the maximum electron-cyclotron maser emission being below our observing range, this seems unlikely. We discuss two possible scenarios: an intrinsic dim radio signal, or alternatively, that the anisotropic beamed emission pointed away from the observer. If the non-detection of radio emission from star-planet interaction in GJ~486 is due to an intrinsically dim signal, this implies that, independently of whether the planet is magnetized or not, the mass-loss rate is small (\dot{M}_\star $\lesssim$ 0.3 \dot{M}_\sun) and that, concomitantly, the efficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into radio emission must be low ($\beta \lesssim 10^{-3}$). Free-free absorption effects are negligible, given the high value of the coronal temperature. Finally, if the anisotropic beaming pointed away from us, this would imply that GJ~486 has very low values of its magnetic obliquity and inclination.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength high-resolution polarimetric imaging of second-generation disc around post-AGB binary IRAS 08544-4431 with SPHERE</title>

Abstract: Exploring the formation and evolution of second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) and post-Red Giant Branch (post-RGB) binaries, provides valuable insights into the complex binary interaction process that concludes the red-giant phase of evolution in these systems. Additionally, it offers a novel opportunity to investigate the formation of second-generation planets within dusty discs surrounding evolved stars. We present a pilot multi-wavelength polarimetric imaging study of the post-AGB binary system IRAS 08544-4431 using the European Southern Observatory-Very Large Telescope/SPHERE instrument. This study is focused on optical V- and I'-band ZIMPOL data to complement near-infrared H-band IRDIS data presented previously. The study aims to investigate the dust scattering properties and surface morphology of the post-AGB circumbinary disc as a function of wavelength. We successfully resolved the extended disc structure of IRAS\,08544-4431, revealing a complex disc morphology, high polarimetric disc brightness (up to ~1.5%), and significant forward scattering at optical wavelengths. Additionally, we found that the disc shows a grey polarimetric colour in both optical and near-infrared. The findings highlight similarities between post-AGB circumbinary discs and protoplanetary discs, suggesting submicron-size porous aggregates as the dominant surface dust composition, and indicating potential warping within the disc. However, further expansion of the multi-wavelength analysis to a larger sample of post-AGB binary systems, as well as high-resolution observations of dust continuum and gas emission, is necessary to fully explore the underlying structure of post-AGB circumbinary discs and associated physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07097</link>

Abstract: In ecological systems, be it a petri dish or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. We show that the occupation fraction versus birth-to-death rate ratio is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.</description>
