      <title>DYNA: Disease-Specific Language Model for Variant Pathogenicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical variant classification of pathogenic versus benign genetic variants remains a challenge in clinical genetics. Recently, the proposition of genomic foundation models has improved the generic variant effect prediction (VEP) accuracy via weakly-supervised or unsupervised training. However, these VEPs are not disease-specific, limiting their adaptation at the point of care. To address this problem, we propose DYNA: Disease-specificity fine-tuning via a Siamese neural network broadly applicable to all genomic foundation models for more effective variant effect predictions in disease-specific contexts. We evaluate DYNA in two distinct disease-relevant tasks. For coding VEPs, we focus on various cardiovascular diseases, where gene-disease relationships of loss-of-function vs. gain-of-function dictate disease-specific VEP. For non-coding VEPs, we apply DYNA to an essential post-transcriptional regulatory axis of RNA splicing, the most common non-coding pathogenic mechanism in established clinical VEP guidelines. In both cases, DYNA fine-tunes various pre-trained genomic foundation models on small, rare variant sets. The DYNA fine-tuned models show superior performance in the held-out rare variant testing set and are further replicated in large, clinically-relevant variant annotations in ClinVAR. Thus, DYNA offers a potent disease-specific variant effect prediction method, excelling in intra-gene generalization and generalization to unseen genetic variants, making it particularly valuable for disease associations and clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>VQDNA: Unleashing the Power of Vector Quantization for Multi-Species Genomic Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to natural language models, pre-trained genome language models are proposed to capture the underlying intricacies within genomes with unsupervised sequence modeling. They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners in biology. However, the hand-crafted tokenization policies used in these models may not encode the most discriminative patterns from the limited vocabulary of genomic data. In this paper, we introduce VQDNA, a general-purpose framework that renovates genome tokenization from the perspective of genome vocabulary learning. By leveraging vector-quantized codebooks as learnable vocabulary, VQDNA can adaptively tokenize genomes into pattern-aware embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To further push its limits, we propose Hierarchical Residual Quantization (HRQ), where varying scales of codebooks are designed in a hierarchy to enrich the genome vocabulary in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on 32 genome datasets demonstrate VQDNA's superiority and favorable parameter efficiency compared to existing genome language models. Notably, empirical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations reveals the fine-grained pattern awareness and biological significance of learned HRQ vocabulary, highlighting its untapped potential for broader applications in genomics.</description>

      <title>grenedalf: population genetic statistics for the next generation of pool sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pool sequencing is an efficient method for capturing genome-wide allele frequencies from multiple individuals, with broad applications such as studying adaptation in Evolve-and-Resequence experiments, monitoring of genetic diversity in wild populations, and genotype-to-phenotype mapping. Here, we present grenedalf, a command line tool written in C++ that implements common population genetic statistics such as $\theta$, Tajima's D, and FST for Pool sequencing. It is orders of magnitude faster than current tools, and is focused on providing usability and scalability, while also offering a plethora of input file formats and convenience options.</description>

      <title>A SARS-CoV-2 Interaction Dataset and VHH Sequence Corpus for Antibody Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system to eliminate harmful foreign substances and have become pivotal therapeutic agents for treating human diseases. To accelerate the discovery of antibody therapeutics, there is growing interest in constructing language models using antibody sequences. However, the applicability of pre-trained language models for antibody discovery has not been thoroughly evaluated due to the scarcity of labeled datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2, a dataset featuring the antigen-variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) interactions obtained from two alpacas immunized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins. AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 includes binary labels indicating the binding or non-binding of diverse VHH sequences to 12 SARS-CoV-2 mutants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, we release VHHCorpus-2M, a pre-training dataset for antibody language models, containing over two million VHH sequences. We report benchmark results for predicting SARS-CoV-2-VHH binding using VHHBERT pre-trained on VHHCorpus-2M and existing general protein and antibody-specific pre-trained language models. These results confirm that AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable benchmarks for evaluating the representation capabilities of antibody language models for binding prediction, thereby facilitating the development of AI-driven antibody discovery. The datasets are available at https://datasets.cognanous.com.</description>
