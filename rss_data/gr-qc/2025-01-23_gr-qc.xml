      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <title>Black hole in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cardoso et al. [Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 6, L061501, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.L061501] on black holes in galaxies, we derive a new black hole solution surrounded by a Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile. The derived metric, influenced by DZ profile parameters, exhibits two distinct regimes: for $r \ll r_{\rm ch}$, exponential corrections dominate, producing significant deviations from the Schwarzschild solution near dense cores, while for $r \gg r_{\rm ch}$, these corrections vanish, restoring the Schwarzschild metric at large distances. These findings ensure consistency with general relativity in vacuum. The black hole shadow and deflection angle are analyzed, demonstrating that the shadow radius scales linearly with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), while higher central densities ($\rho_{\rm ch}$) result in smaller shadows, reflecting the environmental impact of dense dark matter halos. Photon dynamics reveal how DZ profiles modify critical impact parameters and effective potentials, with gravitational lensing effects highly sensitive to the scale radius ($r_{\rm ch}$). Smaller $r_{\rm ch}$ values lead to larger deflection angles due to stronger gravitational effects near compact cores. This work highlights the significance dark matter profiles in shaping black hole observables, providing a theoretical foundation for future observational studies and advancing the understanding of dark matter-black hole interactions in astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>On Equation of State of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains mysterious despite the substantial evidence from astrophysical and cosmological observations. While the majority of DM in our universe is non-relativistic, collisionless and its equation of state (EoS) is approximately pressureless $p\simeq 0$, DM becomes relativistic near the massive black holes in galactic center. Yet its EoS is seldom discussed in the relativistic regime. Here we initially explore the possible equation of state for DM in the vicinity of Schwarzschild black holes. We work in a spherical and quasi-static background spacetime, and describe DM as a perfect fluid in equilibrium. Through numerically solving the TOV equations with physical boundary conditions, we show that DM can have static profiles near black holes and its pressure should be negative in order to support the viable density profiles $\rho$. We illustrate with two simple general equations of state, namely the power law $p \propto \rho^\gamma$ and the radius-dependent $p \propto r\cdot \rho$, and compare them with the observations of the Milky Way. Our findings provide insights into the model-building of DM, which should incorporate the possibility of negative pressure in the relativistic regime around black holes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the cosmological evolution parameters, energy conditions, and linear matter perturbations of an exponential-type model in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmological evolution in a flat FLRW spacetime in the context of modified STEGR gravity or $f(Q)$, using an exponential two-parameter model which represents a smooth perturbative expansion around the $\Lambda$CDM model. The cosmological analysis is carried out by calculating the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, for selected values of the parameters. The Hubble parameter is obtained analytically by means of several approximations good enough to deviate slightly from the $\Lambda$CDM case. Several late-time cosmological parameters are computed, such as: dark energy state parameter, deceleration parameter, statefinder parameters. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior of the classical energy conditions WEC, SEC, NEC, and DEC for both the combination of matter and geometrical contribution and the geometrical contribution alone. Beyond the background level, linear matter perturbations are studied by calculating parameters relevant to structure growth and formation. The overall results indicate that the model may exhibit quintessence-like and phantom-like behavior and it impacts the growth of structures in the universe by means late-time deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Rotating black holes in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity: Newman-Janis Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of rotating black hole solutions within the framework of de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. We demonstrate that any nonunitary gauge with the Minkowski reference metric are equal to a unitary gauge with some curved reference metric. Based on this Lemma, we revisit the process of deriving black hole solutions in dRGT theory. We explain how to obtain a static, spherically symmetric solution and then transform it into the corresponding rotating black hole using the Newman-Janis algorithm. For the first time, we provide an analytic expression for a hairy black hole that can reduce to the non-rotating case. Additionally, we confirm that the Newman-Janis algorithm is applicable in the context of massive gravity.</description>

      <title>Inferring the cosmological constant in early Universe only by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of the Universe is accelerating which can be interpreted as due to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this study, we investigate the behavior of gravitational waves in the presence of a cosmological constant in the early universe. We rigorously analyze the merger rate of binary primordial black holes (PBHs) and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio within the framework of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We find that binary PBHs with a total mass of $M_{\mathrm{tot}}=1000M_{\odot}$ and a redshift larger than $z=500$ are the ideal system for studying the effect of the cosmological constant through LISA. By computing the fisher information matrix, we establish that the cosmological constant can be effectively constrained.</description>

      <title>Stability of fluids in spacetimes with decelerated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of homogeneous barotropic perfect fluid solutions in fixed cosmological spacetimes undergoing decelerated expansion. The results hold provided a specific inequality between the speed of sound of the fluid and the expansion rate of spacetime is valid. Numerical studies in our earlier complementary paper provide strong evidence that the aforementioned condition is sharp, i.e. that instabilities occur when the inequality is violated. In this regard, our present result covers the regime of slowest possible expansion which allows for fluids to stabilize, depending on their speed of sound. Our proof relies on an energy functional which is universal in the sense that it also applies to the case of linear expansion and enables a significantly simplified proof of bounds for fluids on linearly expanding spacetimes. Finally, we consider the special cases of dust and radiation fluids in the decelerated regime and prove shock formation for arbitrarily small perturbations of homogeneous solutions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ gravity, and compare them with those in $f(\mathbb{T}) = \mathbb{T} + \alpha \mathbb{T}^2$ gravity. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity rather than curvature in $f(R)$ or torsion in $f(\mathbb{T})$. Using the finite difference method and the sixth-order WKB method, we compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar and electromagnetic fields. Tables of quasinormal frequencies for various parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB method. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values, offering insights into the characteristics of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.</description>

      <title>A note on Strong Cosmic Censorship and its violation in Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black hole space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penrose's Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture safeguards determinism in General Relativity. Within the initial value approach to General Relativity, proof of Strong Cosmic Censorship preservation is predicated on the unique evolution of the metric. For the Kerr-Newman family of black hole solutions, this requires the inextendability of the metric past the Cauchy horizon, due to the development of a "blue-shift" instability. Attempts to provide a rigorous mathematical proof of Strong Cosmic Censorship has led to the formulation of several Strong Cosmic Censorship conjectures of varying strengths, which seem to be discussed rarely outside of the mathematical relativity literature. In this note, we review some of the arguments for and against Strong Cosmic Censorship preservation, with a focus on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter context, where the positive cosmological constant invites a "red-shift" effect that competes against the "blue-shift". We study the consequent role of quasinormal mode behaviour and illustrate the parameter space for which we consistently observe violations of the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture within Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic features of static, spherically-symmetric Schwarzschild black holes adopting different types of Barrow entropy. Specifically, in addition to the standard Barrow entropy, we consider a logarithmic-corrected type of this entropy by taking into account some loop quantum gravity effects. Moreover, we investigate the black hole thermodynamics from the viewpoint of Barrow entropy in presence of non-extensivity effects coming from the Tsallis statistics. Finally, we compare the results obtained for different Barrow-based entropies.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body model for coalescing binary neutron stars: Incorporating tidal spin and enhanced radiation from dynamical tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions in a coalescing binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) system driven by gravitational wave (GW) radiation contain precious information about physics both at extreme density and in the highly relativistic regime. In the late inspiral stage, where the tidal effects are the strongest, dynamical corrections to the tidal response become significant. Previous analyses model the finite-frequency correction through the effective Love number approach, which only accounts for the correction in the radial interaction but ignores the lag in the tidal bulge behind the companion due to the continuous orbital shrinkage. The lag provides a torque, causing the star's spin to change over time. We dub the evolving component of the spin the tidal spin, whose dimensionless value can reach 0.03-0.4 depending on how rapidly the background star rotates. We present an effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model for BNSs and NSBHs incorporating the tidal spin, particularly its back reaction to the orbit due to the Newtonian tidal torque and the relativistic orbital hang-up. Beyond the conservative dynamics, we also derive the corrections to the dissipative radiation due to finite-frequency effects to the first post-Newtonian order. Depending on the star's background spin, the phase error in the time-domain waveform due to ignoring the tidal spin ranges from 0.3 to 4 radians at the waveform's peak amplitude. The difference in the waveforms with and without the tidal spin remarkably resembles the difference between previous effective Love number models and numerical relativity simulations, underscoring the significance of tidal spin in the construction of faithful models. Our model further extends the description of dynamics in the high-background spin regions of the parameter space that are yet to be covered by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number of propagating degrees of freedom, at non-linear order, in torsion gravity theories, a class of modified theories of gravity that include a propagating torsion in addition to the metric. We focus on a three-parameter subfamily of theories (``torsion bigravity") that contains, at linear order, only two physical excitations: a massless spin-2 one (with two degrees of freedom) and a massive spin-2 one (with five degrees of freedom). We study the dynamics of the massive spin-2 field in the limit where the torsion field decouples from the metric. The number of degrees of freedom of the torsion field is found to {\it change, at non-linear order, from five to nine}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized charge current for a massless, minimally coupled, charged quantum scalar field on a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole space-time, using the method of pragmatic mode-sum renormalization. Since the field exhibits superradiance, we consider the past Unruh, Boulware and Candelas-Chrzanowski-Howard states, and study how the renormalized current in these states depends on the charges of the black hole and scalar field. We also study the backreaction of the charge current on the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of Sco X-1: implications for the current spin frequency and ellipticity of the neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sco X-1 is the brightest observed extra-solar X-ray source, which is a neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), and is thought to have a strong potential for continuous gravitational waves (CW) detection due to its high accretion rate and relative proximity. Here, we compute the long-term evolution of its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency ($\nu$) and the surface magnetic field ($B$), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection. We find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young ($\sim7\times10^6$ yr) LMXB and constrain the current NS mass to $\sim 1.4-1.6~{\rm M}_\odot$. Our computations reveal a rapid $B$ decay, with the maximum current value of $\sim 1.8\times10^8$ G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that the maximum current $\nu$ value is $\sim 550$ Hz, implying that, unlike what is generally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source properties. However, $\nu$ will exceed an observed cut-off frequency of $\sim 730$ Hz, and perhaps even the NS break-up frequency, in the future, without a CW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment ($Q$) to avoid this is $\sim (2-3)\times10^{37}$ g cm$^2$, corresponding to a CW strain of $\sim 10^{-26}$. Our estimation of current $\nu$ values can improve the CW search sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Entropies and their Hamiltonian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In holographic theories, the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area operator plays a key role in our understanding of the emergence of semiclassical Einstein-Hilbert gravity. When higher derivative corrections are included, the role of the area is instead played by a more general functional known as the geometric entropy. It is thus of interest to understand the flow generated by the geometric entropy on the classical phase space. In particular, the fact that the associated flow in Einstein-Hilbert or Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity induces a relative boost between the left and right entanglement wedges is deeply related to the fact that gravitational dressing promotes the von Neumann algebra of local fields in each wedge to type II. This relative boost is known as a boundary-condition-preserving (BCP) kink-transformation. In a general theory of gravity (with arbitrary higher-derivative terms), it is straightforward to show that the flow continues to take the above geometric form when acting on a spacetime where the HRT surface is the bifurcation surface of a Killing horizon. However, the form of the flow on other spacetimes is less clear.
  In this paper, we use the manifestly-covariant Peierls bracket to explore such flows in two-dimensional theories of JT gravity coupled to matter fields with higher derivative interactions. The results no longer take a purely geometric form and, instead, demonstrate new features that should be expected of such flows in general higher derivative theories. We also show how to obtain the above flows using Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Trajectories of light beams in a Kerr metric: the influence of the rotation of an observer on the shadow of a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the trajectories of light beams in a Kerr metric, which describes the gravitational field in the neighborhood of a rotating black hole. After reduction by cyclic coordinates, this problem reduces to analysis of a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. A bifurcation diagram is constructed and a classification is made of the types of trajectories of the system according to the values of first integrals. Relations describing the boundary of the shadow of the black hole are obtained for a stationary observer who rotates with an arbitrary angular velocity about the axis of rotation of the black hole.</description>

      <title>The late-time heating Green's function and improvements to distortion frequency hierarchy treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early energy injection leaves an imprint on the observed blackbody spectrum of the CMB, allowing us to study the thermal history of the Universe. For small energy release, the distortion can be efficiently computed using the quasi-exact Green's function method. For pre-recombination injections, the Green's function has already been studied previously. Here we reconsider the pre- and post-recombination periods, showcasing both the spectral distortion intensity and the relative temperature difference, which encrypt precious information about physical processes such as free-free interactions and thermal decoupling. We present the associated distortion visibility function, investigating the impact of various physical effects. We then study improvements to the so-called frequency hierarchy (FH) treatment, a method that was developed for the modelling of anisotropic distortions, which like the average distortion signals encode valuable cosmological information. Specifically, the FH treatment has shortcomings even in the $\mu$ era, that in principle should be easy to overcome. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to reduce the mismatch, concluding with a redefinition of the $\mu$ spectral shape using CosmoTherm. This solution takes into account double Compton and Bremsstrahlung effects in the low tail, which can be included in the FH. This opens the path towards a refined modeling of spectral distortion anisotropies.</description>

      <title>The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.</description>

      <title>Euclidean AdS wormholes and gravitational instantons in the Einstein-Skyrme theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euclidean AdS wormholes provide a natural setup for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence with multiple boundaries. However, from a bottom-up perspective, they cannot be embedded in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Maxwell theory if these boundaries have positive curvature. Nevertheless, Maldacena and Maoz showed that this obstruction could be circumvented by introducing merons in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Yang-Mills theory. In this work, we show that Euclidean-AdS wormholes also exist in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Skyrme theory, whose matter sector possesses a nontrivial baryonic charge. We compute its free energy and show that it does not depend on the integration constants whatsoever, resembling topological solitons. Additionally, we obtain its holographic stress tensor and show that it vanishes, allowing us to interpret this configuration as a holographic Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) state. Other topologically nontrivial ground states in Einstein-Skyrme theory are found, such as gravitational instantons, representing the homotopically inequivalent vacua of the theory. We find that they develop Hawking-Page phase transitions above a critical temperature. Some of these solutions are periodic in Euclidean time, representing the gravitational analog of calorons in Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Nature of Gravity through Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to determine whether gravity is quantum has challenged physicists since the mid 20th century, due to the impracticability of accessing the Planck scale, where potential quantum gravity effects are expected to become relevant. While recent entanglement-based tests have provided a more promising theoretical path forward, the difficulty of preparing and controlling large quantum states has hindered practical progress. We present an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from complex quantum state manipulation to the simpler observation of a probe's motion. By proving that a classical and local gravitational field must inherently display randomness to interact consistently with quantum matter, we show that this randomness induces measurable diffusion in a probe's motion, even when the probe is in a classical state. This diffusion serves as a distinctive signature of classical gravity coupling to quantum matter. Our approach leverages existing experimental techniques, requiring only the accurate tracking of a probe's classical center of mass motion, and does not need any quantum state preparation, thereby positioning this method as a promising and practical avenue for advancing the investigation into the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for cosmological perturbations: fixing the gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory is an example of a gauge theory, where gauge transformations correspond to changes in the space-time coordinate system. To determine physical quantities, one is free to introduce gauge conditions (\ie to work with specific space-time coordinates), and such conditions are often used to simplify technical aspects of the calculation or to facilitate the interpretation of the physical degrees of freedom. Some of the prescriptions introduced in the literature are known to fix the gauge only partially, but it is commonly assumed that the remaining gauge degrees of freedom can be fixed somehow. In this work, we show that this is not necessarily the case, and that some of these gauges are indeed pathological. We derive a systematic procedure to determine whether a gauge is pathological or not, and to complete partially-fixed gauges into healthy gauges when this is possible. In this approach, the Lagrange multipliers (\ie the perturbed lapse and shift in the ADM formalism) cannot appear in the off-shell definition of the gauges, they necessarily arise as on-shell consequences of the gauge conditions. As illustrative applications, we propose an alternative, non-pathological formulation of the synchronous gauge, and we show that the uniform-expansion gauge (as well as any gauge ensuring vanishing lapse perturbations) can hardly be made healthy. Our methodology also allows us to construct all gauge-invariant variables. We further show that our non-pathological criterion for gauges is also the one that ensures Dirac brackets to be properly defined. This allows cosmological perturbations to be quantised in a gauge-fixed way. We finally discuss possible generalisations of our formalism.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study rigidity aspects of Penrose's singularity theorem. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: if a spacetime satisfies the hypotheses of Penrose's singularity theorem except with weakly trapped surfaces instead of trapped surfaces, then what can be said about the global spacetime structure if the spacetime is null geodesically complete? In this setting, we show that we obtain a foliation of MOTS which generate totally geodesic null hypersurfaces. Depending on our starting assumptions, we obtain either local or global rigidity results. We apply our arguments to cosmological spacetimes (i.e., spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces) and scenarios involving topological censorship.</description>

      <title>The Big Bang: Origins and initial conditions from Self-Regulating Cosmology (SRC) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating appropriate initial conditions for the Universe is key to discussing cosmic evolution constructively. In standard cosmology the traditional approach assumes an early Universe that emerges from an infinite density, spacetime singularity. It then undergoes inflationary expansion, followed by a matter-creating reheat period. This approach produces results generally in good agreement with observations. However, to date it is not known how (or even whether) a true past-directed spacetime-singularity can generate a regular spacetime that becomes the observed Universe. It has previously been suggested that appropriate initial conditions should emerge naturally from existing physics rather than be set a priori. In this work we seek to generate initial conditions predicated on the Self-Regulating Cosmology (SRC) model recently presented [1]. In SRC, cosmic dynamics leads to a universe that also self-regenerates from one evolutionary cosmic phase or (hereafter) kalpa2 to another. Within each such kalpa the dynamics evolves between two disparate scales of horizons. The end of a kalpa and the beginning of the next interface through a phase transition. The interface of the two phases sets up the phase initial conditions of the emerging phase. These include: a natural time-reset, and energy, volume (space) and entropy conditions. The issue of whether (or not) the early Universe undergoes inflation becomes naturally self-manifest in this treatment. In the context of the SRC model, we discuss the Initial Entropy Problem (IEP). Lastly, we highlight on current observations of over-mature (galaxy and black-hole) structures at high redshifts, by JWST.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for noncircularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries II:high accuracy by improving logarithmic terms in resummations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective-one-body (EOB) models are based on analytical building blocks that, mathematically, are truncated Taylor series with logarithms. These functions are usually resummed using Pad\'e approximants obtained first assuming that the logarithms are constant, and then replacing them back into the resulting rational functions. A recent study pointed out that this procedure introduces spurious logarithmic terms when the resummed functions are reexpanded. Here we update the TEOBResumS-Dal\'i waveform model for spin-aligned, noncircularized coalescing black hole binaries by systematically implementing new (still Pad\'e based) resummations for all EOB functions (that is, the metric potentials $A, D$ and the residual waveform amplitude corrections $\rho_{\ell m}$ up to $\ell=8$). Once the model is informed by 50 Numerical Relativity simulations, this new approach proves key in lowering the maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness $\bar{F}_{\rm EOBNR}^{\rm max}$ for the $\ell=m=2$ mode (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_{\odot}$) over 530 spin-aligned waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog. A median unfaithfulness equal to $3.09\times 10^{-4}$ is achieved, which is a marked improvement over the previous value, $1.06\times 10^{-3}$. The largest value, ${\rm Max}[\bar{F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}]= 6.80\times 10^{-3}$, is found for an equal-mass, equal-spin simulation with dimensionless spins $\sim +0.998$; only five configurations have $\bar{F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR} &gt; 5\times 10^{-3}$ (four of which equal-mass and with equal spins larger than $\sim +0.98$). Results for eccentric binaries are similarly excellent (well below $10^{-2}$ and mostly around $10^{-3}$).</description>

Abstract: By constructing a model of spacetime having a strong curvature singularity in which causal geodesics are complete, but more generic causal curves are not, we explicitly show that some electrostatic field configurations on that background are bounded on every open punctured neighborhood of the curvature singularity. Our calculations are performed using the analog gravity description provided by Plebanski and Tamm, according to which the characterization of the electromagnetic field on a generic curved background is equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations in flat space with a matter content verifying certain nontrivial constitutive relations. The regularity of the electric field as it approaches what could be considered the worst conceivable physical condition, opens the door to further investigation into the possibility of propagating signals capable of crossing a spacetime singularity.</description>

      <title>Bridging Dark Energy and Black Holes with EFT: Frame Transformation and Gravitational Wave Speed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typically, constraints on parameters of the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy have been obtained in the Jordan frame, where matter fields are minimally coupled to gravity. To connect these constraints with those of the EFT of black hole perturbations with a timelike scalar profile, it is necessary to perform a frame transformation on the EFT in general. In this paper, we study the conformal/disformal transformation of EFT parameters on an arbitrary background. Furthermore, we explore the effect of an EFT operator $M_6(r) \bar{\sigma}^{\mu}_{\nu} \delta K^{\nu}_{\alpha} \delta K^{\alpha}_{\mu}$, which is elusive to the LIGO/Virgo bound on gravitational-wave speed, on the dynamics of odd-parity black hole perturbations. Intriguingly, a deviation from luminal propagation shows up only in the vicinity of the black hole, and the speeds of perturbations in the radial and angular directions are different in general due to the traceless part $\bar{\sigma}^\mu_\nu$ of the background extrinsic curvature. This study establishes an important link between cosmological constraints and those obtained in the black hole regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

Abstract: While topologically stable cosmic strings are disfavoured by the recent observation of nHz stochastic gravitational waves (GW) by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), e.g., NANOGrav, cosmic metastable strings and superstrings are not. However, because the gravitational waves from all classes of strings generally span a wide range of frequencies, they contradict LIGO's non-observation of stochastic gravitational waves at the $f\sim $ 25 Hz band for a substantial string-parameter space favoured by the PTA data. Suppose ultralight primordial black holes ($M_{\rm BH}&lt;10^9$ g) existed in the early universe. In this case, they reduce the amplitude of the GWs at higher frequencies by providing an early matter-dominated phase, alleviating the tension between LIGO observation and PTA data. We show that the recent PTA data complemented by future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) runs plus detectors such as LISA and ET would be able to dapple the properties and further search strategies of such ultralight primordial black holes which are otherwise fairly elusive as they evaporate in the early universe by Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the solutions of rotating black holes within the framework of de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. We provide a detailed, step-by-step analytical derivation of these solutions. Our solutions are characterized by several parameters: mass $M$ , electric charge $Q_{*}$, angular momentum $a$, and a graviton mass $m$. This graviton mass term incorporates both a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and a St\"uckelberg charge $S_{*}$ into the black hole parameters. These solutions may serve as potential candidates for astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Local Peculiar Motions in McVittie and LTB Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two inhomogeneous cosmological models, namely, the flat McVittie spacetime and a simple specific LTB spacetime. Relative to the world line of a reference comoving observer that remains spatially at rest, we study the local deviations of the world lines of free test particles. These local peculiar motions can be invariantly characterized within the framework of a quasi-inertial Fermi normal coordinate system established along the world line of the reference comoving observer. Tidal dynamics in the McVittie model involves the sum of the curvature due to the inhomogeneity, the curvature due to the background FLRW spacetime and a mixed term, while tidal dynamics in the particular LTB model turns out to be qualitatively the same as in the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Peculiar motions in the two cosmological models are briefly compared and contrasted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution, which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate reflected entropy in certain anisotropic boundary theories dual to nonrelativistic geometries using holography. It is proposed that this quantity is proportional to the minimal area of the entanglement wedge cross section. Using this prescription, we study in detail the effect of anisotropy on reflected entropy and other holographic entanglement measures. In particular, we study the discontinuous phase transition of this quantity for a symmetric configuration consisting of two disjoint strips. We find that in the specific regimes of the parameter space the critical separation is an increasing function of the anisotropy parameter and hence the correlation between the subregions becomes more pronounced. We carefully examine how these results are consistent with the behavior of other correlation measures including the mutual information. Finally, we show that the structure of the universal terms of entanglement entropy is corrected depending on the orientation of the entangling region with respect to the anisotropic direction.</description>

      <title>Predictions of a simple parametric model of hierarchical black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical mergers of black holes are proposed as a mechanism to explain the observations of binary black holes with component masses between $\sim 50M_{\odot}\hbox{--}130M_{\odot}$ by LIGO/Virgo, often referred to as "upper mass gap". We study the efficiency with which hierarchical mergers can produce higher and higher masses using a simple model of the forward evolution of binary black hole populations in gravitationally bound systems like stellar clusters. The model relies on pairing probability and initial mass functions for the black hole population, along with numerical relativity fitting formulas for the mass, spin, and kick speed of the merger remnant. We carry out an extensive comparison of the predictions of our model with clusterBHBdynamics (cBHBd) model, a fast method for the evolution of star clusters and black holes therein. For this comparison, we consider three different pairing functions of black holes and consider simulations from high- and low-metallicity cluster environments from cBHBd. We find good agreements between our model and the cBHBd results when the pairing probability of binaries depends on both total mass and mass ratio. We also assess the efficiency of hierarchical mergers as a function of merger generation and derive the mass distribution of black holes using our model. We find that the multi-modal features in the observed binary black hole mass spectrum -- revealed by the non-parametric population models -- can be interpreted by invoking the hierarchical merger scenario in dense, metal-rich, stellar environments. Further, the two subdominant peaks in the GWTC-3 component mass spectrum are consistent with second and third-generation mergers in metal-rich, dense environments. With more binary black hole detections, our model could be used to infer the black hole initial mass function and pairing probability exponent.</description>

      <title>Dynamical 4-D Gauss-Bonnet action from matter-graviton interaction at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of singularities at the centers of black holes suggests that general relativity (GR), although a highly successful model of gravity and cosmology, is inapplicable. This is due to the breakdown of the equivalence principle. Gauss-Bonnet (GB) action is the simplest extension of GR as it possesses second-order equations of motion and is devoid of ghosts. However, in 4-D, the GB action is topological. Recently, Glavan and Lin proposed a mathematical framework that transforms the 4-D GB gravity theory into a non-topological one. However, it has been argued that without a canonical way to choose 4-D from the higher-dimensional space, such a GB gravity is not well-defined in 4-D. Naturally, there has been much interest in having a systematic procedure for making the 4-D GB term non-topological, such as using the counterterm regularization method in 4-D, regularization with the dimensional derivative, and Kaluza-Klein reduction. The current work takes a step in addressing this issue by demonstrating that the rescaling of the GB coupling $\alpha \rightarrow \alpha/(D - 4)$ arises from the self-energy correction of gravitons in 4-D using \emph{only} the established quantum field theoretic techniques. To keep things transparent, we focus on the linearized theory of gravity coupled with matter fields. By computing the one-loop self-energy correction of gravitons induced by the matter fields, we explicitly provide the origin of the prescription provided by Glavan and Lin. We compare the procedure with other regularization procedures like Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction and conformal scaling regarding the strong coupling problem. Our work naturally opens a new window to considering 4-D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity as the most straightforward modification to GR.</description>

      <title>Testing an oscillatory behavior of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative SVT theories from Kaluza-Klein reductions of Horndeski theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently pointed out that some precise Photon-Galileon couplings in four dimensions (4D) -- inspired by a higher dimensional reduction -- are enough to obtain a Horndeski theory that is less constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the speed of Gravitational Waves. They imply the constancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic evolution. This holds even if we include the general scalar potentials $G_4 (\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\pi)$. In this paper we go into the details of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar sector. We also present the complete action including the general $G_5(\pi,X),\, G_6(\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge invariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction from 5D Horndeski. They provide a {\it consistent} coupling of a higher derivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity -- namely, without inducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance -- in the aim to explore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as vectors and in particular the Photon.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, cosmological constant, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and complex geometries from real-time computations of gravitational R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational R\'enyi computations have traditionally been described in the language of Euclidean path integrals. In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.
  Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we provide an overview of the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars and of the impact of neutrinos on these systems. Observations of colliding neutron stars play an important role in nuclear astrophysics today. They allow us to study the properties of cold nuclear matter and the origin of many heavy elements (gold, platinum, uranium). We show that neutrinos significantly impact the observable signals powered by these events as well as the outcome of nucleosynthesis in the matter that they eject into the surrounding intergalactic medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define absorptive Compton amplitudes, which captures the absorption factor for waves of spin-weight-$s$ scattering in black hole perturbation theory. At the leading order, in the $G M \omega$ expansion, such amplitudes are purely imaginary and expressible as contact terms. Equipped with these amplitudes we compute the mass change in black hole scattering events via Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, where the rest mass of Schwarzschild/Kerr black hole is modified due to absorption of gravitational, electromagnetic, or scalar fields sourced by other compact object. We reproduced the power loss previously computed in the post-Newtonian expansion. The results presented here hold for similar mass ratios and generic spin orientation, while keeping the Kerr spin parameter to lie in the physical region $\chi \le 1$.</description>

      <title>Ultra slow-roll with a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04806</link>

Abstract: We investigate ultra slow-roll inflation with a seed black hole in a de Sitter background. By numerically tracking transitions from slow-roll to ultra slow-roll inflation, we find that quasi-normal mode solutions of the scalar field are excited following the decay of the slow-roll attractor, depending on the mass of the black hole. For small black holes, the picture is similar to standard inflation with the usual damping of the scalar field; with a large black hole, we find that the ringing modes dominate. It is believed that the transition to ultra slow-roll in the pure inflationary case enhances the peak of the primordial power spectrum, thereby increasing the likelihood of primordial black hole formation. We comment on how the novel ringing behaviour due to the seed black hole might impact on cosmological perturbations.</description>

      <title>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study approximate solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation and compare them with the standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling $\alpha$ that is typically very small and functions like $\hbar$ in a WKB expansion. We seek solutions of the form $\Psi = e^{iS/\alpha} \psi$ that are the closest quantum analog of a given classical background spacetime. The function $S$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while $\psi$ obeys a Schr\"odinger-like equation and can be given a probabilistic interpretation. The semiclassical limit suggests a specific relation between $\psi$ and the standard perturbation-theory wavefunction $\psi_P$. We verify this relation in two main examples: a scalar field with a purely exponential potential, of which simple scaling solutions are known and a slow-roll scenario expanded in the vicinity of the origin in field space. Each example is worked out in two different gauges, that are the minisuperspace equivalent of unitary gauge and spatially flat gauge. We discuss possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the higher ``time" derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation but not in the perturbative approach. We clarify the \emph{conditional probability} content of the wavefunctions and how this is related with the standard gauge fixing procedure in perturbation theory.</description>
