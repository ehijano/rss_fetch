      <title>On the positivity of light-ray operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider light-ray operators $\mathcal{L}_{2n} = \int\mathrm{d} x^+ (x^+)^{2n}T_{++}$, where $x^+$ is a null coordinate and $n$ a positive integer, in QFT in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions. These operators are generalizations of the average null energy operator, which is positive. We give a proof that the light-ray operators are positive in a non-minimally coupled but otherwise free scalar field theory, and we present various arguments that show that $\mathcal{L}_2$ is positive semi-definite in two-dimensional conformal field theories. However, we are also able to construct reasonable states which contradict these results by exploiting an infrared loophole in our proof. To resolve the resulting tension, we conjecture that the light-ray operators are positive in a more restrictive set of states. These states satisfy stronger conditions than the Hadamard condition, and have the interpretation of states that can be physically prepared. Our proposal is nontrivial even in two-dimensional CFT.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability from Lorentzian path integrals and codimension-two singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has previously been shown how the gravitational thermal partition function can be obtained from a Lorentzian path integral. Unlike the Euclidean case, the integration contour over Lorentzian metrics is not immediately ruled out by the conformal factor problem. One can then ask whether this contour can be deformed to pick up nontrivial contributions from various saddle points. In Einstein-Maxwell theory, we argue that the relevance of each black hole saddle to the thermal partition function depends on its thermodynamic stability against variations in energy, angular momentum, and charge. The argument involves consideration of constrained saddles where area and quantities associated with angular momentum and charge are fixed on a codimension-two surface. Consequently, this surface possesses not only a conical singularity, but two other types of singularities. The latter are characterized by shifts along the surface and along the Maxwell gauge group acquired as one winds around near the surface in a metric-orthogonal and connection-horizontal manner. We first study this enlarged class of codimension-two singularities in generality and propose an action for singular configurations. We then incorporate these configurations into the path integral calculation of the partition function, focusing on three-dimensional spacetimes to simplify the treatment of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Full affine Kac-Moody vertex algebra from factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a prefactorisation algebra on any real two-dimensional conformal Euclidean manifold $\Sigma$ which locally encodes the non-chiral version $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa} = \mathbb{V}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa} \otimes \bar{\mathbb{V}}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ of the affine Kac-Moody vertex algebra $\mathbb{V}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ associated with any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a level $\kappa : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{C}$. We consider in detail the case of the $2$-sphere $\Sigma = S^2$ equipped with a certain orientation reversing involution. This setting is used to construct a Hermitian sesquilinear product on $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ as well as derive the operator formalism for $\mathbb{F}^{\mathfrak{g}, \kappa}$ describing the Fourier mode decompositions of quantum operators on $S^1$ built out of a pair of chiral and anti-chiral $\mathfrak{g}$-valued currents on $S^1$ with central extension determined by $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>A three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We for the first time construct a three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2')$ orientifold with discrete torsion. We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism, generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Reduction and K\"ahler Metric for Metric Moduli in Imaginary Self-Dual Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding which effective field theories are consistent with an ultraviolet completion in quantum gravity is an important theoretical question. Therefore, it is important to know the structure of the 4D effective theory associated with a given compactification of string theory. We present a first-principles derivation of the low-energy 4D effective theory of geometric moduli in a warped Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory with imaginary self-dual 3-form flux. This completes the derivation of the metric on K\"ahler moduli space from the 10D equations of motion. We also give the first derivation of an effective action for flat directions in the complex structure moduli space of the Calabi-Yau (which generically mix with the axiodilaton).</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Dispersive vacuum as a decoherence amplifier of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, interest has been growing in studies on discrete or "pixelated" space-time that, through modifications in the dispersion relation, can treat the vacuum as a dispersive medium. Discrete spacetime considers that spacetime has a cellular structure on the order of the Planck length, and if this is true we should certainly have observable effects. In this paper, we investigated the effects caused by the dispersive vacuum on the decoherence process of an Unruh-DeWitt detector, our setup consists of a uniformly accelerated detector, initially in a qubit state, which interacts with a massless scalar field during a time interval finite. We use dispersion relations drawn from doubly special relativity and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, with these modifications the vacuum becomes dispersive and has a corresponding refractive index. We calculate the probability transition rates, the probability of finding the detector in the ground state, and the quantum coherence variation. Our results indicate that the decoherence process occurs more quickly in cases with changes in the dispersion relation in the regime of high accelerations and interaction time. Additionally, the decoherence increases as the vacuum becomes more dispersive due to the increase in the order of modification in the dispersion relation, and this happens because the dispersive vacuum amplifies the effects of quantum fluctuations that are captured by the detector when interacting with the field.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries III: Noether Realization in Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the asymptotic Yang-Mills phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid which admits a realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. This Noether charge is naturally conserved in the absence of radiation. Furthermore, the algebroid can be restricted to the covariant wedge symmetry algebra, which we analyze for non radiative cuts. The key ingredient in this construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Yang-Mills equations of motion. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is represented canonically as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String Theory is a hot topic of physics and mathematics. For the former, it stands as a huge sandbox where the formulation of difficult problems can be simplified and their hard computations carried out. For the latter, it stands as a direct contribution upstream, going from physics to maths, rather than the usual other way around. These notes provide a comprehensive review of the bosonic string action, the entering point of String Theory, and also covers the resulting equations of motion and the effective mass of open and closed strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric geometrodynamics is studied for scalar-tensor theory and Einstein General Relativity minimally coupled to a scalar field. We discussed the importance of boundary terms and derived the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian canonical formalism both in the Jordan and Einstein frames. These two frames are connected through an Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained gauge-fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We discussed the effects of the singularity of the Hamiltonian canonical transformation connecting Jordan and Einstein frames for two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole solution in the Jordan frame).</description>

      <title>Fermion liquids as quantum Hall liquids in phase space: A unified approach for anomalies and responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of many strongly correlated metallic phases have inspired novel routes to generalize or go beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi liquid theory. To this end, from universal consideration of symmetries and anomalies, Else, Thorngren and Senthil (ETS) have introduced a class of theories called ersatz Fermi liquids which possess a Fermi surface and satisfy a generalized Luttinger's theorem. In this work, we view all such fermion liquids obeying the Luttinger theorem as incompressible quantum Hall liquids in higher-dimensional phase space and use it as the starting point to derive their effective low-energy field theory. The non-commutativity of phase space motivates us to use Seiberg-Witten map to derive the field theory in an ordinary (commutative) space and naturally leads to terms that correspond to the correct topological Chern-Simons action postulated by ETS in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, our approach also reproduces all the non-topological terms that characterize important contributions to the response, including the semiclassical equations of motion. Finally, our derivations of Chern-Simons terms from the Seiberg-Witten map also verify a longstanding conjecture in non-commutative field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to explain in clear and pedagogical terms how some particle-physics models and/or mechanisms can naturally lead to inflation and how this can provide testable predictions that can help us find new physics effects. Two well-established features of theoretical particle physics are linked to an essential property of inflation, a naturally-flat inflaton potential: (1) scale invariance, broken by small quantum corrections, and (2) Goldstone's theorem. It is also illustrated how to combine several scenarios of this type to obtain a rather general particle-physics motivated inflationary setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

      <title>SUSY design of smooth quantum rings in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a suitable technique to design zero-energy graphene models with radial electrostatic potentials capable of achieving electrostatic confinement. Using the Gaussian law for electrostatics, we derive the charge density associated with these potentials that correspond to concentric electrostatic rings. The technique is based on a modified supersymmetric transformation that allows to design time-reversal invariant interaction terms and to find the corresponding zero-energy bound states in analytical form. Consequently, solutions with the same probability density but different angular momentum are characterized by circular probability currents flowing in opposite directions. The energies of the systems defined in two Dirac valleys (one-valley) have a fourfold (twofold) degeneracy. As an example of the technique, we construct a ring-decorated Coulomb potential that exhibits zero energy collapse and bound states together.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Viability of $f(Q, T)$ Gravity: Constraining Parameters with Cosmological Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the model of $ f(Q, T) $ gravity, an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity where the nonmetricity scalar $ Q $ is non-minimally coupled to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $ T $. The model is developed as an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and is analyzed using a cosmic chronometer and Pantheon$^+$ supernovae data sets. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the model parameters $ \alpha $, $ \beta $, and $ H_0 $, and compare the performance of the model with $\Lambda$CDM by evaluating statistical measures such as chi-square, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion. The results show that the $ f(Q, T) $ model effectively mimics $\Lambda$CDM while offering an alternative explanation based on modified gravity. We also examine cosmographic parameters like the deceleration parameter, confirming the transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration, and the violation of the strong energy condition, which aligns with observed late-time cosmic acceleration. Additionally, the model provides age estimates for the Universe that are consistent with current observations.</description>

      <title>Scotoseesaw mechanism from a $Z_3$ symmetry of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the neutrino mass generation and the dark matter stability can be governed by the center of the QCD group, which is a $Z_3$ group. Three right-handed neutrinos $N_{1,2,3R}$ transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w,w^2$, where $w=e^{i2\pi/3}$ is the cube root of unity, and they couple to usual lepton doublets via the usual Higgs doublet $H$ and two new scalar doublets $\eta,\chi$, which transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w^2,w$, respectively. This leads to a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generations are induced by the Majorana $N_{1R}$ mass and the Dirac $N_{2,3R}$ mass, respectively. Although the lightest of the $Z_3$ fields is stabilized, responsible for dark matter, the model lacks an explanation for relic density and/or direct detection. The issue can be solved in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge completion of the model, for which the center of the QCD group is isomorphic to $Z_3=\{1,T,T^2\}$ for $T=w^{3(B-L)}$.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium dynamics in the quantum Brownian regime with non-abelian quantum master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions is one of the best probes of the QGP formed in these collisions. Resorting to accurate methods to describe the $Q\bar{Q}$ evolution in a QGP is a prerequisite for the precise interpretation of experimental data. Among these methods, the quantum master equations (QME) derived within the formalism of open quantum systems are particularly relevant. We present exact numerical solutions in a 1D setting of previously derived quantum master equations (QME) in their quantum Brownian regime. Distinctive features of the in-medium bottomonia evolution with the QME are presented; some phenomenological consequences are addressed by considering evolutions for a fixed as well as EPOS4 temperature profiles. Next, we investigate the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation (often used to describe charmonium production in URHIC) by benchmarking the corresponding evolutions on the exact solutions derived with the QME for the case of a $c\bar{c}$ pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-temperature ($q\to1$) asymptotics of 4d superconformal indices of Lagrangian theories have been recently analyzed up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Here we use RG-inspired tools to extend the analysis to the exponentially suppressed terms in the context of Schur indices of $N=2$ SCFTs. In particular, our approach explains the curious patterns of logarithms (polynomials in $1/\log q$) found by Dedushenko and Fluder in their numerical study of the high-temperature expansion of rank-$1$ theories. We also demonstrate compatibility of our results with the conjecture of Beem and Rastelli that Schur indices satisfy finite-order, possibly twisted, modular linear differential equations (MLDEs), and discuss the interplay between our approach and the MLDE approach to the high-temperature expansion. The expansions for $q$ near roots of unity are also treated. A byproduct of our analysis is a proof (for Lagrangian theories) of rationality of the conformal dimensions of all characters of the associated VOA, that mix with the Schur index under modular transformations.</description>

Abstract: We apply machine learning to understand fundamental aspects of holographic duality, specifically the entropies obtained from the apparent and event horizon areas. We show that simple features of only the time series of the pressure anisotropy, namely the values and half-widths of the maxima and minima, the times these are attained, and the times of the first zeroes can predict the areas of the apparent and event horizons in the dual bulk geometry at all times with a fixed maximum length ($10$) of the input vector. We also argue that the entropy functions are the measures of information that need to be extracted from simple one-point functions to reconstruct specific aspects of correlation functions of the dual state with the best possible approximations.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Symmetry in Calabi-Yau Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct examples of non-invertible global symmetries in two-dimensional superconformal field theories described by sigma models into Calabi-Yau target spaces. Our construction provides some of the first examples of non-invertible symmetry in irrational conformal field theories. Our approach begins at a Gepner point in the conformal manifold where the sigma model specializes to a rational conformal field theory and we can identify all supersymmetric topological Verlinde lines. By deforming away from this special locus using exactly marginal operators, we then identify submanifolds in moduli space where some non-invertible symmetry persists. For instance, along ten-dimensional loci in the complex structure moduli space of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds there is a symmetry characterized by a Fibonacci fusion category. The symmetries we identify provide new constraints on spectra and correlation functions. As an application we show how they constrain conformal perturbation theory, consistent with recent results about scaling dimensions in the K3 sigma model near its Gepner point.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to the flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. A possible tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method to analytically prove global stability in ghost-ridden dynamical systems. Our proposal encompasses all prior results and consequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow from a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to expectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root on a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for the first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions to field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for inter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.</description>

      <title>Timelike-bounded $dS_4$ holography from a solvable sector of the $T^2$ deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has leveraged the tractability of $T\bar T$ style deformations to formulate timelike-bounded patches of three-dimensional bulk spacetimes including $dS_3$. This proceeds by breaking the problem into two parts: a solvable theory that captures the most entropic energy bands, and a tuning algorithm to treat additional effects and fine structure. We point out that the method extends readily to higher dimensions, and does not require factorization of the full $T^2$ operator (the higher dimensional analogue of $T\bar T$ defined in [1]). Focusing on $dS_4$, we first define a solvable theory at finite $N$ via a restricted $T^2$ deformation of the $CFT_3$ on ${S}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, in which $T$ is replaced by the form it would take in symmetric homogeneous states, containing only diagonal energy density $E/V$ and pressure (-$dE/dV$) components. This defines a finite-N solvable sector of $dS_4/\text{deformed-CFT}_3$, capturing the radial geometry and count of the entropically dominant energy band, reproducing the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a state count. To accurately capture local bulk excitations of $dS_4$ including gravitons, we build a deformation algorithm in direct analogy to the case of $dS_3$ with bulk matter recently proposed in [2]. This starts with an infinitesimal stint of the solvable deformation as a regulator. The full microscopic theory is built by adding renormalized versions of $T^2$ and other operators at each step, defined by matching to bulk local calculations when they apply, including an uplift from $AdS_4/CFT_3$ to $dS_4$ (as is available in hyperbolic compactifications of M theory). The details of the bulk-local algorithm depend on the choice of boundary conditions; we summarize the status of these in GR and beyond, illustrating our method for the case of the cylindrical Dirichlet condition which can be UV completed by our finite quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

Abstract: We study the modular symmetry of localized modes on fixed points of $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. First, we find that the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally have $\Delta(6n^2)$ ($\Delta'(6n^2)$) modular flavor symmetry. Moreover, when we consider an additional Ansatz, the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally enjoy $S_3$ ($S'_4$) modular flavor symmetry, and we show the concrete wave functions of the localized modes.</description>

Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

Abstract: We study thermal states of the strongly coupled Klebanov-Witten ${\cal N}=1$ superconformal gauge theory with R-symmetry chemical potential. The theory has two distinct dimension $\Delta=3$ chiral primary operators that develop a condensate at the same critical value of the chemical potential. One instability is associated with the spontaneous fluxification (the appearance of the 3-form flux) of the holographic dual black hole, while the other one is associated with the spontaneous scalarization (the activation of the deformation mode of the conifold). Different phases dominate in grand canonical and microcanonical ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact convergent expression for the partition function of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ $(2,4k)$ minimal superstring theory with type 0B GSO projection in the ungapped phase by leveraging the duality between this theory and a double-scaled unitary matrix integral. Taking the $k\rightarrow\infty$ limit, we also obtain the complete partition function of $\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, including all contributions associated with "doubly non-perturbative" effects. We discover that the fundamental objects of the string theory are a linear combination of the standard FZZT branes which we call F-branes, along with their charge-conjugate partners which we call anti-F-branes. Summing over the disk and cylinder diagram contributions of the F-branes and anti-F-branes and integrating over their moduli space completely reproduces our expression for the partition function from the matrix integral side of the duality. We show that the string theory can be expressed precisely in the formalism of dressed free fermions and we propose a Hilbert space interpretation of our results. We present exact expressions for the matrix integral correlators of the double-scaled eigenvalue density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility. In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>

      <title>Cut-and-join operators in cohomological field theory and topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a cubic cut-and-join operator description for the partition function of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion for a local spectral curve with simple ramification points. In particular, this class contains partition functions of all semi-simple cohomological field theories. The cut-and-join description leads to an algebraic version of topological recursion. For the same partition functions we also derive N families of the Virasoro constraints and prove that these constraints, supplemented by a deformed dimension constraint, imply the cut-and-join description.</description>

      <title>BKP-Affine Coordinates and Emergent Geometry of Generalized Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten Tau-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Zhou's framework, we consider the emergent geometry of the generalized Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten models whose partition functions are known to be a family of tau-functions of the BKP hierarchy. More precisely, we construct a spectral curve together with its special deformation, and show that the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion on this spectral curve emerges naturally from the Virasoro constraints for the generalized BGW tau-functions. Moreover, we give the explicit expressions for the BKP-affine coordinates of these tau-functions and their generating series. The BKP-affine coordinates and the topological recursion provide two different approaches towards the concrete computations of the connected $n$-point functions. Finally, we show that the quantum spectral curve of type $B$ in the sense of Gukov-Su{\l}kowski emerges from the BKP-affine coordinates and Eynard-Orantin topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Astrophysical Neutrino Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, with TeV--PeV energies, offer unique insight into astrophysics and particle physics. Their incoming directions and flavor composition -- i.e., the proportion of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos in their flux -- are, individually, rewarding observables. Combined, they offer new opportunities, hitherto unexplored, that we expose for the first time. Anisotropy in the arrival directions of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos may reveal multiple populations of neutrino sources, differently distributed in the sky, and test whether neutrinos of different flavor propagate preferentially along certain directions, such as expected from breaking Lorentz invariance. Using 7.5 years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we make the first measurement of the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, constrain the presence of flavor dipoles and quadrupoles, and improve constraints on "compass asymmetries" introduced by Lorentz invariance violation. In the near future, upcoming neutrino telescopes will improve these measurements across the board.</description>

      <title>Special $N$-dimensional charged anti-de-Sitter black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravitational theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the absence of spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ because of the constraint derived from its field equations, which yields either $\mathbb{Q}=0 $ or $f_{\mathbb{Q} \mathbb{Q}}=0 $ \cite{Heisenberg:2023lru,Maurya:2023muz}. We are going to introduce a tours solutions for charged anti-de-Sitter black holes in $N$-dimensions within the framework of the quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where the coincident gauge condition is applied \cite{Heisenberg:2023lru}. Here, $f(\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}+\frac{1}2\alpha \mathbb{Q}^2-2\Lambda$, and the condition $N \geq 4$ is satisfied. These black hole solutions exhibit flat or cylindrical horizons as their distinctive features. An intriguing aspect of these black hole solutions lies in the coexistence of electric monopole and quadrupole components within the potential field, which are indivisible and exhibit interconnected momenta. This sets them apart from the majority of known charged solutions in the linear form of the non-metricity theory and its extensions. Moreover, the curvature singularities in these solutions are less severe compared to those found in known charged black hole solutions within the characteristic can be demonstrated by computing certain invariants of the curvature and non-metricity tensors. Finally, we calculate thermodynamic parameters, including entropy, Hawking temperature, and Gibbs free energy. These thermodynamic computations affirm the stability of our model.</description>

      <title>Twists of superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of "conformal twists" of superconformal field theories in dimensions 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. The conformal twists describe all possible inequivalent choices of a nilpotent element in the superconformal algebra. Such twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</description>

      <title>Connecting the circular and drifted Rindler Unruh effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory, each stationary motion is associated with an effective, energy-dependent notion of temperature, which generalises the familiar Unruh temperature of uniform linear acceleration. Motivated by current experimental interest in circular motion, we analyse the effective temperature for drifted Rindler motion, generated by a boost and a spacelike translation (drift), and the way in which drifted Rindler motion can be smoothly (and in fact real analytically) deformed to circular motion through a third type of motion known as parator. For an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions, we establish analytic results in the limits of large gap, small gap and large drift speed. For fixed proper acceleration, the drifted Rindler temperature remains bounded in the large gap limit, in contrast to the circular motion temperature, which can be arbitrarily large in this limit. Finally, in 2+1 dimensions, we trace the vanishing of the circular motion temperature in the small gap limit to the weak decay of the Wightman function, and we show that, among all types of stationary motion in all dimensions, this phenomenon is unique to 2+1 dimensions and therein to circular and parator motion.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Ordering Ambiguities in Weak Chern-Simons 4D Gravity and Metastability of the Condensate-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a 4D cosmological Running-Vacuum-type Model (RVM) of inflation that characterises string-inspired Chern-Simons (CS) gravity. It has been shown that inflation in such models is caused by a condensation of the gravitational CS (gCS) terms induced by primordial gravitational waves (GW), which leads to a linear-axion potential, thus breaking the shift symmetry, and lifting its periodicity (monodromy). We demonstrate here that this inflationary phase may be metastable, due to the existence of non-trivial imaginary parts of the gCS condensate. These imaginary parts are quantum effects, proportional to appropriate commutators of GW perturbations. As we stress, their existence is quantum-ordering-scheme dependent. We argue here in favor of a physical importance of such imaginary parts, which we compute to second order in the GW (tensor) perturbations in the framework of a specific gauge-fixed effective Lagrangian, within a (mean field) weak-quantum-gravity path integral approach. We pay specific attention to the various space-time boundary terms. We thus provide an estimate of the life time of inflation. On matching our results with the relevant inflationary phenomenology, we fix the quantum-ordering ambiguities, and obtain an order-of-magnitude constraint on the ratio of the string energy scale $M_s$ in this model to the (four-spacetime-dimensional) reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$, specifically, $M_s/M_{\rm Pl} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This is consistent with the corresponding estimate obtained in previous analyses by the authors in this framework, based on a dynamical-system approach to linear-axion RVM inflation. Finally, we examine the role of periodic modulations in the axion potential induced by non-perturbative stringy effects on the slow-roll inflationary parameters, and find compatibility with the cosmological data.</description>

      <title>NNLL Transverse Momentum Dependent evolution in the Parton Branching method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the preparation period for precision measurements in the newly planned collider experiments, the understanding of the 3D structure of hadron is becoming increasingly urgent. This triggers the activities to include elements of Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization physics in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. The method designed especially to address this need is the TMD Parton Branching (PB) method. The equivalence of the PB Sudakov form factor, both perturbative and non-perturbative, to the one of Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) is demonstrated and the recent development to increase the low-qt resummation precision of the PB Sudakov up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order by using effective soft-gluon coupling is discussed. The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel is extracted from PB Drell-Yan (DY) predictions obtained with different modelling of radiation.</description>
