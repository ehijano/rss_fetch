      <title>Input gradient annealing neural network for solving low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel yet simple deep learning approach, called input gradient annealing neural network (IGANN), for solving stationary Fokker-Planck equations. Traditional methods, such as finite difference and finite elements, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Neural network based algorithms are meshless methods, which can avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training. We demonstrate that the IGANN method can effectively solve high-dimensional and low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations through our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic fluids with transport noise: Approximating diffusion from data using SVD and ensemble forecast back-propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and test methods for the calibration of the diffusion term in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) describing fluids. We take two approaches, one uses ideas from the singular value decomposition and the Biot-Savart law. The other backpropagates through an ensemble forecast, with respect to diffusion parameters, to minimise a probabilistic ensemble forecasting metric. We describe the approaches in the specific context of solutions to SPDEs describing the evolution of fluid particles, sometimes called inviscid vortex methods. The methods are tested in an idealised setting in which the reference data is a known realisation of the parameterised SPDE, and also using a forecast verification metric known as the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS).</description>

      <title>Towards quantum gravity with neural networks: Solving quantum Hamilton constraints of 3d Euclidean gravity in the weak coupling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 3-dimensional Euclidean gravity in the weak coupling limit of Smolin and show that it is BF-theory with $\text{U(1)}^3$ as a Lie group. The theory is quantised using loop quantum gravity methods. The kinematical degrees of freedom are truncated, on account of computational feasibility, by fixing a graph and deforming the algebra of the holonomies to impose a cutoff on the charge vectors. This leads to a quantum theory related to $\text{U}_q \text{(1)}^3$ BF-theory. The effect of imposing the cutoff on the charges is examined. We also implement the quantum volume operator of 3d loop quantum gravity. Most importantly we compare two constraints for the quantum model obtained: a master constraint enforcing curvature and Gauss constraint, as well as a combination of a quantum Hamilton constraint constructed using Thiemann's strategy and the Gauss master constraint. The two constraints are solved using the neural network quantum state ansatz, demonstrating its ability to explore models which are out of reach for exact numerical methods. The solutions spaces are quantitatively compared and although the forms of the constraints are radically different, the solutions turn out to have a surprisingly large overlap. We also investigate the behavior of the quantum volume in solutions to the constraints.</description>

      <title>Version 2.0.0 -- SPARC: Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SPARC is an accurate, efficient, and scalable real-space electronic structure code for performing ab initio Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations. Version 2.0.0 of the software provides increased efficiency, and includes spin-orbit coupling, dispersion interactions, and advanced semilocal as well as hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, where it outperforms state-of-the-art planewave codes by an order of magnitude and more, with increasing advantages as the number of processors is increased. These new features further expand the range of physical applications amenable to first principles investigation.</description>

      <title>The hybrid anti-symmetrized coupled channels method (haCC) for the tRecX code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of the hybrid antisymmetrized Coupled Channels (haCC) method in the framework of the tRecX [A. Scrinzi, Comp. Phys. Comm., 270:108146, 2022.]. The method represents atomic and molecular multi-electron functions by combining CI functions, Gaussian molecular orbitals, and a numerical single-electron basis. It is suitable for describing high harmonic generation and the strong-field dynamics of ionization. Fully differential photo\-emission spectra are computed by the tSurff method. The theoretical background of haCC is outlined and key improvements compared to its original formulation are highlighted. We discuss control of over-completeness resulting from the joint use of the numerical basis and Gaussian molecular orbitals by pseudo-inverses based on the Woodbury formula. Further new features of this tRecX release are the iSurff method, new input features, and the AMOS gateway interface. The mapping of haCC into the tRecX framework for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is shown. Use, performance, and accuracy of haCC are discussed on the examples of high-harmonic generation and strong-field photo-emission by short laser pulses impinging on the Helium atom and on the linear molecules $N_2$ and $CO$.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Prediction of Multi-million Atom Systems Through Uncertainty Quantification Enabled Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state electron density -- obtainable using Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) simulations -- contains a wealth of material information, making its prediction via machine learning (ML) models attractive. However, the computational expense of KS-DFT scales cubically with system size which tends to stymie training data generation, making it difficult to develop quantifiably accurate ML models that are applicable across many scales and system configurations. Here, we address this fundamental challenge by employing transfer learning to leverage the multi-scale nature of the training data, while comprehensively sampling system configurations using thermalization. Our ML models are less reliant on heuristics, and being based on Bayesian neural networks, enable uncertainty quantification. We show that our models incur significantly lower data generation costs while allowing confident -- and when verifiable, accurate -- predictions for a wide variety of bulk systems well beyond training, including systems with defects, different alloy compositions, and at unprecedented, multi-million-atom scales. Moreover, such predictions can be carried out using only modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Particle-in-Cell Simulations Through Learning and GPU Computing for Hybrid Particle Accelerator Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle accelerator modeling is an important field of research and development, essential to investigating, designing and operating some of the most complex scientific devices ever built. Kinetic simulations of relativistic, charged particle beams and advanced plasma accelerator elements are often performed with high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations, some of which fill the largest GPU supercomputers. Start-to-end modeling of a particle accelerator includes many elements and it is desirable to integrate and model advanced accelerator elements fast, in effective models. Traditionally, analytical and reduced-physics models fill this role. The vast data from high-fidelity simulations and power of GPU-accelerated computation open a new opportunity to complement traditional modeling without approximations: surrogate modeling through machine learning. In this paper, we implement, present and benchmark such a data-driven workflow, synthesising a fully GPU-accelerated, conventional-surrogate simulation for hybrid particle accelerator beamlines.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>MLQAOA: Graph Learning Accelerated Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multilevel QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time.
