      <title>To jump or not to jump: Adhesion and viscous dissipation dictate the detachment of coalescing wall-attached bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble coalescence can promote bubble departure at much smaller sizes compared to buoyancy. This can critically enhance the efficiency of gas-evolving electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. In this study, we integrate high-speed imaging experiments and direct numerical simulations to dissect how and under which conditions bubble coalescence on surfaces leads to detachment. Our transparent electrode experiments provide new insights into contact line dynamics, demonstrating that the bubble neck generally does not contact the surface during coalescence. We reveal that whether coalescence leads to bubble departure or not is determined by the balance between surface energy, adhesion forces, and viscous dissipation. For the previously unexplored regime at low effective Ohnesorge number, a measure of viscosity that incorporates the effect of asymmetry between the coalescing bubbles, we identify a critical dimensionless adhesion energy threshold of $\approx$15% of the released surface energy, below which bubbles typically detach. We develop a global energy balance model that successfully predicts coalescence outcomes across diverse experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Far-Field Aeroacoustic Shape Optimization Using Large Eddy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an aeroacoustic shape optimization framework that integrates a Flux Reconstruction (FR) spatial discretization, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) formulation, and the gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) optimization algorithm. The aeroacoustic solver, employing the FW-H formulation in the time domain for moving medium problems, undergoes thorough verification with analytical test cases and validation using a high-order unstructured solver for both inviscid and viscous flows. We then highlight the necessity of data surface duplication for accurate far-field noise prediction of spanwise periodic problems. The proposed far-field aeroacoustic optimization framework, implemented in parallel, ensures consistent runtime for each optimization iteration, regardless of the number of design parameters, addressing a key limitation of some gradient-free algorithms. The objective is to minimize the Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) at a far-field observer, with a constraint to maintain the lift coefficient and a penalty to prevent any increase in drag coefficient, prioritizing noise reduction while preserving aerodynamic performance. Evaluating this framework on NACA 4-digit airfoils demonstrates a notable OASPL reduction by $14.4~dB$ and over $14\%$ decrease in the mean drag coefficient while maintaining the mean lift coefficient. These findings underscores the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach for far-field aeroacoustic shape optimization in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Subgrid-scale modeling of turbulent shear flow with vortons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel subgrid-scale model for shear flows, exploiting the spatial intermittency and the scale separation between large-scale flows and coherent small-scale structures. The model is highly sparse, focusing exclusively on the most intense structures, which are represented by vortons dynamically regularized quasi-singularities that experience rapid distortion from the large-scale shear. The vortons, in turn, influence the large-scale flow through the sub-grid stress tensor. The model displays an interesting transition between two distinct regimes: (i) a laminar regime, where dissipation is entirely attributed to the large-scale flow, and the vortons dynamics is essentially diffusive, and (ii) a turbulent regime, in which most of the dissipation arises from the vortons. These regimes correspond to different scalings of dissipation and the Grashof number as functions of the Reynolds number, with power-law relationships that resemble those observed in classical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Channel deformations during elastocapillary spreading of gaseous embolisms in biomimetic leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleation and/or spreading of bubbles in water under tension (due to water evaporation) can be problematic for most plants along the ascending sap network from root to leaves, named xylem. Due to global warming, trees facing drought conditions are particularly threatened by the formation of such air embolisms, which spreads intermittently and hinder the flow of sap and could ultimately result in their demise. PDMS-based biomimetic leaves simulating evapotranspiration have demonstrated that, in a linear configuration, the existence of a slender constriction in the channel allows for the creation of intermittent embolism propagation (as an interaction between the elasticity of the biomimetic leaf (mainly the deformable ceiling of the microchannels) and the capillary forces at the air/water interfaces) \cite{Keiser2022}-\cite{keiser2024}. Here we use analog PDMS-based biomimetic leaves in 1d and 2d. To better explore the embolism spreading mechanism, we add to the setup an additional technique, allowing to measure directly the microchannel's ceiling deformation versus time, which corresponds to the pressure variations. We present here such a method that allows to have quantitative insights in the dynamics of embolism spreading. The coupling between channel deformations and the Laplace pressure threshold explains the observed elastocapillary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Full-domain POD modes from PIV asynchronous patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is proposed to obtain full-domain spatial modes based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements performed at different (overlapping) spatial locations. This situation occurs when large domains are covered by multiple non-simultaneous measurements and yet the large-scale flow field organization is to be captured. The proposed methodology leverages the definition of POD spatial modes as eigenvectors of the spatial correlation matrix, where local measurements, even when not obtained simultaneously, provide each a portion of the latter, which is then analyzed to synthesize the full-domain spatial modes. The measurement domain coverage is found to require regions overlapping by 50-75% to yield a smooth distribution of the modes. The procedure identifies structures twice as large as each measurement patch. The technique, referred to as Patch POD, is applied to planar PIV data of a submerged jet flow where the effect of patching is simulated by splitting the original PIV data. Patch POD is then extended to 3D robotic measurement around a wall-mounted cube. The results show that the patching technique enables global modal analysis over a domain covered with a multitude of non-simultaneous measurements.</description>

      <title>How far does the influence of the free surface extend in turbulent open channel flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent open channel flow is known to feature a multi-layer structure near the free surface. In the present work we employ direct numerical simulations considering Reynolds numbers up to $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=900$ and domain sizes large enough ($L_x=12 \pi h$, $L_z=4 \pi h$) to faithfully capture the effect of very-large-scale motions in order to test the proposed scaling laws and ultimately answer the question: How far does the influence of the free surface extend? In the region near the free surface, where fluctuation intensities of velocity and vorticity become highly anisotropic, we observe the previously documented triple-layer structure, consisting of a wall-normal velocity damping layer that scales with the channel height $h$, and two sublayers that scale with the near-surface viscous length scale $\ell_V=\mathrm{Re}_b^{-1/2}h$ and with the Kolmogorov length scale $\ell_K=\mathrm{Re}_b^{-3/4}h$, respectively. The Kolmogorov sublayer measures $\delta_K \approx 20 \ell_K$ and the layer, where the wall-normal turbulence intensity decreases linearly to zero near the free surface, scales with $\ell_V$ and the corresponding near-surface viscous sublayer measures $\delta_V \approx \ell_V$. Importantly, the streamwise turbulence intensity profile for $\mathrm{Re}_\tau \ge 400$ suggests that the influence of the free-slip boundary penetrates essentially all the way down to the solid wall through the appearance of enhanced very-large-scale motions ($\delta_{SIL}\approx h$). In contrast, the layer where the surface-normal turbulence intensity is damped to zero is restricted to the free surface ($\delta_{NVD}\approx 0.3h$). As a consequence, the partitioning of the surface-influenced region has to be expanded to a four-layer structure that spans the entire channel height $h$.</description>

      <title>Advection-based multiframe iterative correction for pressure estimation from velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06060v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method to improve the accuracy of pressure field estimation from time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry data is proposed. This method generates several new time-series of velocity field by propagating in time the original one using an advection-based model, which assumes that small-scale turbulence is advected by large-scale motions. Then smoothing is performed at the corresponding positions across all the generated time-series. The process is repeated through an iterative scheme. The proposed technique smears out spatial noise by exploiting time information. Simultaneously, temporal jitter is repaired using spatial information, enhancing the accuracy of pressure computation via the Navier-Stokes equations. We provide a proof of concept of the method with synthetic datasets based on a channel flow and the wake of a 2D wing. Different noise models are tested, including Gaussian white noise and errors with some degree of spatial coherence. Additionally, the filter is evaluated on an experimental test case of the wake of an airfoil, where pressure field ground truth is not available. The result shows the proposed method performs better than conventional filters in velocity and pressure field estimation, especially when spatially coherent errors are present. The method is of direct application in advection-dominated flows, although its extension with more advanced models is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Simulation and modelling of convective mixing of carbon dioxide in geological formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform large-scale numerical simulations of convection in 3D porous media at Rayleigh-Darcy numbers up to $Ra=8\times10^4$. To investigate convective mixing of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in geological formations, we consider a semi-infinite domain, where the CO$_2$ concentration is constant at top and no flux is prescribed at bottom. Convection begins with a diffusion-dominated phase, transitions to convection-driven solute finger formation, and ends with a shutdown stage as fingers reach the bottom boundary and the concentration in the system increases. For $Ra \ge 5\times10^3$, we observe a constant flux regime with dissolution flux stabilizing at 0.019, approximately 13\% higher than in 2D estimates. At high $Ra$, the top boundary exhibits hierarchical flow structures that drive the formation of large megaplumes in the interior, consistent with Rayleigh-Darcy convection. These findings extend solutal convection insights to 3D and high-$Ra$, improving the reliability of models predicting the long-term CO$_2$ dynamics in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Urban Wind Environment Using Fourier Neural Operator Across Different Wind Directions and Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of urban wind environments is crucial for urban planning, pollution control, and renewable energy utilization. However, the computational requirements of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods make them impractical for real cities. To address these limitations, this study investigates the effectiveness of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model in predicting flow fields under different wind directions and urban layouts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model in predicting urban wind conditions under different wind directions and urban layouts. By training the model on velocity data from large eddy simulation data, we evaluate the performance of the model under different urban configurations and wind conditions. The results show that the FNO model can provide accurate predictions while significantly reducing the computational time by 99%. Our innovative approach of dividing the wind field into smaller spatial blocks for training improves the ability of the FNO model to capture wind frequency features effectively. The SDF data also provides important spatial building information, enhancing the model's ability to recognize physical boundaries and generate more realistic predictions. The proposed FNO approach enhances the AI model's generalizability for different wind directions and urban layouts.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Transition to Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that bodies with two planes of symmetry can display a range of behaviors even without inertia. Any such body supports a conserved quantity in its dynamics, and is either a settler, a drifter or a flutterer, depending only on its shape. At large time, settlers and drifters, respectively, fall vertically and obliquely, while flutterers rotate forever while executing intricate patterns. The dynamics of flutterers decouples into a periodic and a Floquet part with different timescales, giving periodicity or quasiperiodicity. We design a set of bodies and use the boundary integral method to show that settlers, drifters, and flutterers, all lie in this set.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Scheme based on Positivity Preservation with Exact Shock Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a kinetic model with flexible velocities that satisfy positivity preservation conditions for the Euler equations. Our 1D kinetic model consists of two velocities and employs both the asymmetrical and symmetrical models. Switching between the two models is governed by our formulation of kinetic relative entropy along with an additional criterion to ensure an accurate, entropic, and robust scheme. In 2D, we introduce a novel three-velocity kinetic model, defined to ensure a locally one-dimensional formulation for the resulting macroscopic normal flux. For first order accuracy, we also obtain a limit on the time step which ensures positivity preservation. The resulting numerical scheme captures grid-aligned steady shocks exactly. Several benchmark compressible flow test cases are solved in 1D and 2D to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic instabilities of propagating interfaces under Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic instabilities of propagating interfaces in Hele-Shaw channels or porous media under the influence of an imposed flow and gravitational acceleration are investigated within the framework of Darcy's law. The stability analysis pertains to an interface between two fluids with different densities, viscosities, and permeabilities, which can be susceptible to Darrieus-Landau, Saffman-Taylor, and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. A theoretical analysis, treating the interface as a hydrodynamic discontinuity, yields a simple dispersion relation between the perturbation growth rate $s$ and its wavenumber $k$ in the form $s=(ak - bk^2)/(1+ck)$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants determined by problem parameters. The constant $a$ characterises all three hydrodynamic instabilities, which are long-wave in nature. In contrast, $b$ and $c$, which characterize the influences of local curvature and flow strain on interface propagation speed, typically provide stabilisation at short wavelengths comparable to interface's diffusive thickness. The theoretical findings for Darcy's law are compared with a generalisation of the classical work by Joulin &amp; Sivashinsky, which is based on an Euler-Darcy model. The comparison provides a conceptual bridge between predictions based on Darcy's law and those on Euler's equation and offers valuable insights into the role of confinement on interface instabilities in Hele-Shaw channels. Numerical analyses of the instabilities are carried out for premixed flames using a simplified chemistry model and Darcy's law. The numerical results corroborate with the explicit formula with a reasonable accuracy. Time-dependent numerical simulations of unstable premixed flames are carried out to gain insights into the nonlinear development of these instabilities.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Super-Resolution Simulation Method of Three-Dimensional Street-Scale Atmospheric Flows for Real-Time Urban Micrometeorology Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-stage super-resolution simulation method is proposed for street-scale air temperature and wind velocity, which considerably reduces computation time while maintaining accuracy. The first stage employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correct large-scale flows above buildings in the input low-resolution simulation results. The second stage uses another CNN to reconstruct small-scale flows between buildings from the output of the first stage, resulting in high-resolution inferences. The CNNs are trained using high-resolution simulation data for the second stage and their coarse-grained version for the first stage as the ground truth, where the high-resolution simulations are conducted independently of the low-resolution simulations used as input. This learning approach separates the spatial scales of inference in each stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using micrometeorological simulations in an actual urban area around Tokyo Station in Japan. The super-resolution simulation successfully inferred high-resolution atmospheric flows, reducing errors by approximately 50% compared to the low-resolution simulations. Furthermore, the two-stage approach enabled localized high-resolution inferences, reducing GPU memory usage to as low as 12% during training. The total wall-clock time for 60-min predictions was reduced to 6.83 min, which was 3.32% of the high-resolution simulation time.</description>
