      <title>Respiratory Inhaler Sound Event Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While this condition can be managed by administering controller medications through handheld inhalers, clinical studies have shown low adherence to the correct inhaler usage technique. Consequently, many patients may not receive the full benefit of their medication. Automated classification of inhaler sounds has recently been studied to assess medication adherence. However, the existing classification models were typically trained using data from specific inhaler types, and their ability to generalize to sounds from different inhalers remains unexplored. In this study, we adapted the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised learning model for inhaler sound classification by pre-training and fine-tuning this model on inhaler sounds. The proposed model shows a balanced accuracy of 98% on a dataset collected using a dry powder inhaler and smartwatch device. The results also demonstrate that re-finetuning this model on minimal data from a target inhaler is a promising approach to adapting a generic inhaler sound classification model to a different inhaler device and audio capture hardware. This is the first study in the field to demonstrate the potential of smartwatches as assistive technologies for the personalized monitoring of inhaler adherence using machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Will AI shape the way we speak? The emerging sociolinguistic influence of synthetic voices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.</description>

      <title>Deep Audio Watermarks are Shallow: Limitations of Post-Hoc Watermarking Techniques for Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the audio modality, state-of-the-art watermarking methods leverage deep neural networks to allow the embedding of human-imperceptible signatures in generated audio. The ideal is to embed signatures that can be detected with high accuracy when the watermarked audio is altered via compression, filtering, or other transformations. Existing audio watermarking techniques operate in a post-hoc manner, manipulating "low-level" features of audio recordings after generation (e.g. through the addition of a low-magnitude watermark signal). We show that this post-hoc formulation makes existing audio watermarks vulnerable to transformation-based removal attacks. Focusing on speech audio, we (1) unify and extend existing evaluations of the effect of audio transformations on watermark detectability, and (2) demonstrate that state-of-the-art post-hoc audio watermarks can be removed with no knowledge of the watermarking scheme and minimal degradation in audio quality.</description>

      <title>SonicSieve: Bringing Directional Speech Extraction to Smartphones Using Acoustic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30{\deg} angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Generalized Audio Deepfake Detection Using Frame-level Latent Information Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizability, the capacity of a robust model to perform effectively on unseen data, is crucial for audio deepfake detection due to the rapid evolution of text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) technologies. A promising approach to differentiate between bonafide and spoof samples lies in identifying intrinsic disparities to enhance model generalizability. From an information-theoretic perspective, we hypothesize the information content is one of the intrinsic differences: bonafide sample represents a dense, information-rich sampling of the real world, whereas spoof sample is typically derived from lower-dimensional, less informative representations. To implement this, we introduce frame-level latent information entropy detector(f-InfoED), a framework that extracts distinctive information entropy from latent representations at the frame level to identify audio deepfakes. Furthermore, we present AdaLAM, which extends large pre-trained audio models with trainable adapters for enhanced feature extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, the audio deepfake forensics 2024 (ADFF 2024) dataset was built by the latest TTS and VC methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities. Further analytical studies confirms the efficacy of AdaLAM in extracting discriminative audio features and f-InfoED in leveraging latent entropy information for more generalized deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Progressive Rock Music Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the classification of progressive rock music, a genre characterized by complex compositions and diverse instrumentation, distinct from other musical styles. Addressing this Music Information Retrieval (MIR) task, we extracted comprehensive audio features, including spectrograms, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chromagrams, and beat positions from song snippets using the Librosa library. A winner-take-all voting strategy was employed to aggregate snippet-level predictions into final song classifications. We conducted a comparative analysis of various machine learning techniques. Ensemble methods, encompassing Bagging (Random Forest, ExtraTrees, Bagging Classifier) and Boosting (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting), were explored, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to manage computational constraints with high-dimensional feature sets. Additionally, deep learning approaches were investigated, including the development of custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) architectures (named "Zuck" and "Satya") featuring specific layer configurations, normalization, and activation functions. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a state-of-the-art Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, leveraging its attention-based mechanisms for audio classification. Performance evaluation on validation and test sets revealed varying effectiveness across models, with ensemble methods like Extra Trees achieving test accuracies up to 76.38%. This research provides insights into the application and relative performance of diverse machine learning paradigms for the nuanced task of progressive rock genre classification.</description>

      <title>Dopamine Audiobook: A Training-free MLLM Agent for Emotional and Human-like Audiobook Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audiobook generation, which creates vivid and emotion-rich audio works, faces challenges in conveying complex emotions, achieving human-like qualities, and aligning evaluations with human preferences. Existing text-to-speech (TTS) methods are often limited to specific scenarios, struggle with emotional transitions, and lack automatic human-aligned evaluation benchmarks, instead relying on either misaligned automated metrics or costly human assessments. To address these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a new unified training-free system leveraging a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as an AI agent for emotional and human-like audiobook generation and evaluation. Specifically, we first design a flow-based emotion-enhanced framework that decomposes complex emotional speech synthesis into controllable sub-tasks. Then, we propose an adaptive model selection module that dynamically selects the most suitable TTS methods from a set of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTS methods for diverse scenarios. We further enhance emotional expressiveness through paralinguistic augmentation and prosody retrieval at word and utterance levels. For evaluation, we propose a novel GPT-based evaluation framework incorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo prompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experiments show that our method generates long speech with superior emotional expression to SOTA TTS models in various metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework demonstrates better alignment with human preferences and transferability across audio tasks.

      <title>Code Drift: Towards Idempotent Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural codecs have demonstrated strong performance in high-fidelity compression of audio signals at low bitrates. The token-based representations produced by these codecs have proven particularly useful for generative modeling. While much research has focused on improvements in compression ratio and perceptual transparency, recent works have largely overlooked another desirable codec property -- idempotence, the stability of compressed outputs under multiple rounds of encoding. We find that state-of-the-art neural codecs exhibit varied degrees of idempotence, with some degrading audio outputs significantly after as few as three encodings. We investigate possible causes of low idempotence and devise a method for improving idempotence through fine-tuning a codec model. We then examine the effect of idempotence on a simple conditional generative modeling task, and find that increased idempotence can be achieved without negatively impacting downstream modeling performance -- potentially extending the usefulness of neural codecs for practical file compression and iterative generative modeling workflows.</description>

      <title>FNSE-SBGAN: Far-field Speech Enhancement with Schrodinger Bridge and Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevailing method for neural speech enhancement predominantly utilizes fully-supervised deep learning with simulated pairs of far-field noisy-reverberant speech and clean speech. Nonetheless, these models frequently demonstrate restricted generalizability to mixtures recorded in real-world conditions. To address this issue, this study investigates training enhancement models directly on real mixtures. Specifically, we revisit the single-channel far-field to near-field speech enhancement (FNSE) task, focusing on real-world data characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high reverberation, and mid-to-high frequency attenuation. We propose FNSE-SBGAN, a framework that integrates a Schrodinger Bridge (SB)-based diffusion model with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and subjective evaluations, significantly reducing the character error rate (CER) by up to 14.58% compared to far-field signals. Experimental results demonstrate that FNSE-SBGAN preserves superior subjective quality and establishes a new benchmark for real-world far-field speech enhancement. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework leveraging matrix rank analysis in the time-frequency domain, providing systematic insights into model performance and revealing the strengths and weaknesses of different generative methods.</description>

      <title>Point Processes and spatial statistics in time-frequency analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite-energy signal is represented by a square-integrable, complex-valued function $t\mapsto s(t)$ of a real variable $t$, interpreted as time. Similarly, a noisy signal is represented by a random process. Time-frequency analysis, a subfield of signal processing, amounts to describing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of a signal. Loosely speaking, if $s$ is the audio recording of a musical piece, time-frequency analysis somehow consists in writing the musical score of the piece. Mathematically, the operation is performed through a transform $\mathcal{V}$, mapping $s \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ onto a complex-valued function $\mathcal{V}s \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of time $t$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The squared modulus $(t, \omega) \mapsto \vert\mathcal{V}s(t,\omega)\vert^2$ of the time-frequency representation is known as the spectrogram of $s$; in the musical score analogy, a peaked spectrogram at $(t_0,\omega_0)$ corresponds to a musical note at angular frequency $\omega_0$ localized at time $t_0$. More generally, the intuition is that upper level sets of the spectrogram contain relevant information about in the original signal. Hence, many signal processing algorithms revolve around identifying maxima of the spectrogram. In contrast, zeros of the spectrogram indicate perfect silence, that is, a time at which a particular frequency is absent. Assimilating $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}$ through $z = \omega + \mathrm{i}t$, this chapter focuses on time-frequency transforms $\mathcal{V}$ that map signals to analytic functions. The zeros of the spectrogram of a noisy signal are then the zeros of a random analytic function, hence forming a Point Process in $\mathbb{C}$. This chapter is devoted to the study of these Point Processes, to their links with zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions, and to designing signal detection and denoising algorithms using spatial statistics.</description>

      <title>SpoofCeleb: Speech Deepfake Detection and SASV In The Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpoofCeleb, a dataset designed for Speech Deepfake Detection (SDD) and Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV), utilizing source data from real-world conditions and spoofing attacks generated by Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems also trained on the same real-world data. Robust recognition systems require speech data recorded in varied acoustic environments with different levels of noise to be trained. However, current datasets typically include clean, high-quality recordings (bona fide data) due to the requirements for TTS training; studio-quality or well-recorded read speech is typically necessary to train TTS models. Current SDD datasets also have limited usefulness for training SASV models due to insufficient speaker diversity. SpoofCeleb leverages a fully automated pipeline we developed that processes the VoxCeleb1 dataset, transforming it into a suitable form for TTS training. We subsequently train 23 contemporary TTS systems. SpoofCeleb comprises over 2.5 million utterances from 1,251 unique speakers, collected under natural, real-world conditions. The dataset includes carefully partitioned training, validation, and evaluation sets with well-controlled experimental protocols. We present the baseline results for both SDD and SASV tasks. All data, protocols, and baselines are publicly available at https://jungjee.github.io/spoofceleb.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Whisper on Low-Resource Languages for Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for low-resource languages by introducing a novel data generation method that converts sentence-level data into a long-form corpus, using Swiss German as a case study. Non-sentence-level data, which could improve the performance of long-form audio, is difficult to obtain and often restricted by copyright laws. Our method bridges this gap by transforming more accessible sentence-level data into a format that preserves the model's ability to handle long-form audio and perform segmentation without requiring non-sentence-level data. Our data generation process improves performance in several real-world applications and leads to the development of a new state-of-the-art speech-to-text (STT) model for Swiss German. We compare our model with a non-fine-tuned Whisper and our previous state-of-the-art Swiss German STT models, where our new model achieves higher BLEU scores. Our results also indicate that the proposed method is adaptable to other low-resource languages, supported by written guidance and code that allows the creation of fine-tuned Whisper models, which keep segmentation capabilities and allow the transcription of longer audio files using only sentence-level data with high quality.</description>

      <title>UniForm: A Unified Multi-Task Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions. Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: Foley is a key element in video production, refers to the process of adding an audio signal to a silent video while ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. In recent years, the rise of personalized content creation and advancements in automatic video-to-audio models have increased the demand for greater user control in the process. One possible approach is to incorporate text to guide audio generation. While supported by existing methods, challenges remain in ensuring compatibility between modalities, particularly when the text introduces additional information or contradicts the sounds naturally inferred from the visuals. In this work, we introduce CAFA (Controllable Automatic Foley Artist) a video-and-text-to-audio model that generates semantically and temporally aligned audio for a given video, guided by text input. CAFA is built upon a text-to-audio model and integrates video information through a modality adapter mechanism. By incorporating text, users can refine semantic details and introduce creative variations, guiding the audio synthesis beyond the expected video contextual cues. Experiments show that besides its superior quality in terms of semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization the proposed method enable high textual controllability as demonstrated in subjective and objective evaluations.</description>
