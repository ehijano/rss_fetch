      <title>Spectral Deformation Flow and Global Classification of Simply-Connected Closed Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a spectral deformation flow for amplitudes $C_n(\tau)$, governed by a second-order self-adjoint operator $\hat{C}$ on a compact domain. This flow leads to exponential stabilization $C_n(\tau) \to \pi$, encoded in the spectral multi-function $C(v,\tau,n)$, which describes the geometric deformation across scales. Building on prior results on spectral rigidity, completeness, and asymptotics of $\hat{C}$, we analyze conditions under which this convergence determines the full topological and smooth structure of simply-connected closed manifolds in all dimensions $d \ge 3$. Using spectral asymptotics and global analysis, we show that such convergence uniquely selects the standard sphere, excluding exotic smooth structures and isospectral non-isometric manifolds within the operator domain. In particular, we examine the critical case $d = 4$ and prove that no non-standard smooth structure can yield the limiting spectral profile. These results suggest that the spectrum of $\hat{C}$, shaped by its geometric flow, serves as a complete invariant of smooth geometry.</description>

      <title>$\hat{H}$-eigenvalues of Hermitian tensors and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\hat{H}$-eigenvalue for $2m$-th order $n$-dimensional complex tensors. Then we determine several checkable inclusion sets for $\hat{H}$-eigenvalues and derive some criterions for the Hermitian positive definiteness (semi-definiteness) of Hermitian and CPS tensors. We also apply the Hermitian tensors to study holomorphic sectional curvature in complex differential geometry and reprove the algebraic part of recent results by Alvarez-Heier-Zheng and Chaturvedi-Heier.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of Discrete spectra of Dirichlet Laplacian in 3-dimensional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate monotonicity properties of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian in polyhedral layers of fixed width. We establish that eigenvalues below the essential spectrum threshold monotonically depend on geometric parameters defining the polyhedral layer, generalizing previous results known for planar V-shaped waveguides and conical layers. Moreover, we demonstrate non-monotone spectral behavior arising from asymmetric geometric perturbations, providing an explicit example where unfolding the polyhedral angle unexpectedly leads to the emergence of discrete eigenvalues. The limiting behavior of eigenvalues as the geometric parameters approach critical configurations is also rigorously analyzed.</description>

      <title>The S-functional calculus for the Clifford adjoint operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we work within the framework of modules over the Clifford algebra $\mathbb{R}_d$. Our investigation focuses on the S-spectrum and the S-functional calculus in its various forms for the adjoint T* of a Clifford operator T. One of the key results we present is that the bisectoriality of T can be transferred to T*. This is grounded in the fact that, for Clifford operators, the S-spectrum of the adjoint operator T* is identical to that of T. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for the existing formulations of the S-functional calculus, including bounded, unbounded, $\omega$, and $H^\infty$ versions, there is a clear connection between the left functional calculus of T and the right functional calculus of T*. This explicit link between the left functional calculus of T and the right functional calculus of T* and vice versa is obtained using the function $f^\#(s):=\overline{f(\overline{s})}$. Finally, we discuss the fact that the S-spectrum, related to the invertibility of the second-order operator T^2-2s_0T+|s|^2, can actually be characterized through the invertibility of the first-order $\mathbb{R}$-linear operator T-I^Rs.</description>

      <title>Non-r-partite graphs without complete split subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Simonovits' chromatic critical edge theorem shows that for sufficiently large $n$, if $H$ is an edge-color-critical graph with $\chi(H)=p+1\ge 3$, then the Tur\'an graph $T_{n,p}$ is the unique extremal graph with respect to ${\rm ex}(n,H)$. Denote by ${\rm EX}_{r+1}(n,H)$ and ${\rm SPEX}_{r+1}(n,H)$ the family of $n$-vertex $H$-free non-$r$-partite graphs with the maximum size and with the spectral radius, respectively. Li and Peng [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 37 (2023) 2462--2485] characterized the unique graph in $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$ for $r\geq 2$ and showed that $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})\subseteq \mathrm{EX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$. It is interesting to study the extremal or spectral extremal problems for color-critical graph $H$ in non-$r$-partite graphs. For $p\geq 2$ and $q\geq 1$, we call the graph $B_{p,q}:=K_p\nabla qK_1$ a complete split graph (or generalized book graph). In this note, we determine the unique spectral extremal graph in $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,B_{p,q})$ and show that $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,B_{p,q})\subseteq \mathrm{EX}_{r+1}(n,B_{p,q})$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Dielectric scattering resonances for high-refractive resonators with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for the analysis of nonlinear dielectric resonances in wave scattering by high-index resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearities. We consider both two- and three-dimensional settings and prove the existence of nonlinear dielectric resonances in the subwavelength regime, bifurcating from the zero solution at the corresponding linear resonances. Furthermore, we derive asymptotic expansions for the nonlinear resonances and states in terms of the high contrast parameter $\tau$ and the normalization constant. For a symmetric dimer of resonators, these small-amplitude nonlinear resonant states exhibit either symmetric or antisymmetric profiles. In three dimensions, under conditions valid in the dilute regime, we prove that as the field amplitude increases, mode hybridization induces a symmetry-breaking bifurcation along the principal symmetric solution branch at a critical amplitude. This bifurcation gives rise to two asymmetric resonant states, each localized on one of the particles in the dimer. Remarkably, in two dimensions, we show that no such symmetry-breaking bifurcation exists along the principal solution branches, owing to the distinct scaling behavior of the principal nonlinear subwavelength resonance arising from the logarithmic singularity.</description>

      <title>Pr\"ufer Transformation and Spectral Analysis for a Sturm--Liouville-Type Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a second-order differential equation involving a quasi-derivative of the form $y^\prime + s(x)y$, leading to a non-self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville-type problem with four coefficient functions. To analyze this equation, we develop a generalized Pr\"ufer transformation that expresses solutions in terms of amplitude and phase variables. The resulting system is nonlinear, reflecting the structure of the original operator. Using this framework, we establish comparison theorems, prove the monotonicity of eigenfunction zeros with respect to the spectral parameter, and derive upper and lower bounds for the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>On localization for the alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Anderson localization near the spectral edge for some alloy-type Anderson-Bernoulli model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with exponential long-range hopping. This extends the work of Bourgain [Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, LNM 1850: 77--99, 2004], in which he pioneered a novel multi-scale analysis to treat Bernoulli random variables. Our proof is mainly based on Bourgain's method. However, to establish the initial scales Green's function estimates, we adapt the approach of Klopp [Comm. Math. Phys, Vol. 232, 125--155, 2002], which is based on the Floquet-Bloch theory and a certain quantitative uncertainty principle. Our proof also applies to an analogues model on $\mathbb{R}^d.$</description>

      <title>Towards an Explainable Comparison and Alignment of Feature Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.
