      <title>Compound V3 Economic Audit Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compound Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that enables the secure and efficient borrowing and lending of cryptocurrencies, utilizing smart contracts and dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand to facilitate transactions. The protocol enables users to supply different crypto assets and accrue interest, while borrowers can avail themselves of loans secured by collateralized assets. Our collaboration with Compound Finance focuses on harnessing the power of the Chainrisk simulation engine to optimize risk parameters of the Compound V3 (Comet) protocol. This report delineates a comprehensive methodology aimed at calculating key risk metrics of the protocol. This optimization framework is pivotal for mitigating systemic risks and enhancing the overall stability of the protocol. By leveraging Chainrisk's Cloud Platform, we conduct millions of simulations to evaluate the protocol's Value at Risk (VaR) and Liquidations at Risk (LaR), ultimately providing recommendations for parameter adjustments.</description>

      <title>Deviance Voronoi Residuals for Space-Time Point Process Models: An Application to Earthquake Insurance Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insurance risk arising from catastrophes such as earthquakes a component of the Minimum Capital Test for federally regulated property and casualty insurance companies. Analyzing earthquake insurance risk requires well-fitted spatio-temporal point process models. Given the spatial heterogeneity of earthquakes, the ability to assess whether the fits are adequate in certain locations is crucial in obtaining usable models. Accordingly, we extend the use of Voronoi residuals to calculate deviance Voronoi residuals. We also create a simulation-based approach, in which losses and insurance claim payments are calculated by relying on earthquake hazard maps of Canada. As an alternative to the current guidelines of OSFI, a formula to calculate the country-wide minimum capital test is proposed based on the correlation between the provinces. Finally, an interactive web application is provided which allows the user to simulate earthquake damage and the resulting financial losses and insurance claims, at a chosen epicenter location.</description>

      <title>Formation of Optimal Interbank Networks under Liquidity Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of an optimal interbank network in a model where banks control both their supply of liquidity, through cash reserves, and their exposures to other banks' risky projects. The value of each bank's project may suddenly decline depending on their cash reserves and both the occurence and magnitude of liquidity shocks. In two distinct settings, we solve the system-wide optimal control problem and obtain explicit formulas for the unique optimal allocations of capital. In the first decentralized setting, banks seek only to maximize their own expected utility. Second, a central planner aims to maximize the sum of all banks' expected utilities. Both of the resulting networks exhibit a `core-periphery' structure in equilibrium. However, in the decentralized setting, banks elect to hold less cash reserves compared to the centralized setting, leading to greater susceptibility to liquidity shortages. We characterize the behavior of the planner's optimal allocation as the size of the system grows. Surprisingly, the relative welfare gap is of constant order. Finally, we derive co-investment requirements that allow the decentralized system to achieve the planner's optimal level of risk. In doing so, we find that banks in the network's core are subjected to the highest co-investment requirements -- ensuring that they are sufficiently incentivized to hold significant cash reserves. Our analysis may inform regulators' requirements on banks' liquidity reserves, as have been debated in the wake of the 2023 regional banking crisis in the US.</description>
