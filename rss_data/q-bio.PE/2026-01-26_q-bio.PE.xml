      <title>Adaptive dynamics of eco-evolutionary repeated games: Effect of reward and punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term evolutionary processes can strongly influence common-pool resource conservation by generating new traits or behaviours that modify the feedback between population strategies and the resource state. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary framework in which individuals repeatedly interact with the same opponent and follow direct reciprocity through reactive strategies. The strategic dynamics is coupled to a renewable common resource and analyzed using adaptive dynamics. After our exhaustive non-linear dynamical analysis of $2\times2$ strategic games, we focus on comparative and combined usefulness of institutional incentives in the form of rewards and punishments in preventing the Tragedy of the Commons even when defection dominates in the replete resource state. We also report possibility of robust stable oscillations -- emerging via Hopf bifurcation -- in resource state and population strategies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast topological data analysis reveals pandemic-scale dynamics of convergent evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genome variants which re-occur independently across evolutionary lineages are key molecular signatures of adaptation. Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolutionary processes. However, existing approaches depend on the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees, which remains challenging at scale. Here we present EVOtRec, an organism-agnostic, fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach that enables the inference of convergently evolving genomic variants over time directly from topological patterns in the dataset, without requiring the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Using data from both simulations and published experiments, we show that EVOtRec can robustly identify variants under positive selection and performs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches, with comparable results. We apply EVOtRec to three large viral genome datasets: SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A subtype H5N1 and HIV-1. We identify key convergent genome variants and demonstrate how EVOtRec facilitates the real-time tracking of high fitness variants in large datasets with millions of genomes, including effects modulated by varying genomic backgrounds. We envision our Topological Data Analysis approach as a new framework for efficient comparative genomics.</description>

      <title>Inference of germinal center evolutionary dynamics via simulation-based deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: B cells and the antibodies they produce are vital to health and survival, motivating research on the details of the mutational and evolutionary processes in the germinal centers (GC) from which mature B cells arise. It is known that B cells with higher affinity for their cognate antigen (Ag) will, on average, tend to have more offspring. However the exact form of this relationship between affinity and fecundity, which we call the ``affinity-fitness response function'', is not known. Here we use deep learning and simulation-based inference to learn this function from a unique experiment that replays a particular combination of GC conditions many times.

      <title>SEIR models with host heterogeneity: theoretical aspects and applications to seasonal influenza dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population heterogeneity is a key factor in epidemic dynamics, influencing both transmission and final epidemic size. While heterogeneity is often modelled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR epidemic models, assuming that at the epidemic start there is no pre-existing immunity. Under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness, one obtains a closed system of 3 ODEs, which can be easily simulated and for which some analytical results are obtained. In particular, we proved that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $R_0$. We specialised in the case where susceptibility is distributed according to a gamma or extended Beta distribution, showing how the epidemic final size depends on the variance of the distribution. In the case of a gamma-distributed susceptibility, the resulting model consists of a system of ODEs with just one parameter more than the classical SEIR model; this makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by fitting data on seasonal influenza in Italy, and comparing the results to those obtained with simple SEIR models with pre-existing immunity.</description>

      <title>Validating Behavioral Proxies for Disease Risk Monitoring via Large-Scale E-commerce Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital traces of daily activities, such as e-commerce (EC) purchase histories, provide scalable signals for public health surveillance, yet their epidemiological validity remains unclear. This study validates a behavioral proxy for disease onset, defined as transitions from regular to therapeutic diets, by comparing large-scale EC data (N=55,645) against independent insurance-derived clinical records. Using feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) as a case study, the proxy showed strong agreement with clinical data for ingredient-level risk patterns (r=0.74) and seasonal dynamics (r=0.82). Furthermore, analysis using EC data alone reproduced the established protective association of wet food consumption. These results demonstrate that validated behavioral signals from EC data can serve as cost-effective complements to traditional surveillance, with potential applicability to monitoring lifestyle-related diseases in human populations.</description>
