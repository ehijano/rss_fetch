      <title>The Dark Side of a Tera-Z Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future circular $e^+e^-$ collider (FCC-ee or CEPC) will provide unprecedented sensitivity to indirect new physics signals emerging as small deviations from the Standard Model predictions in electroweak precision tests. Assuming new physics scenarios containing a dark matter candidate and a $t$-channel mediator, we analyse the synergy and interplay of future Tera-$Z$ factories and non-collider tests conducted through direct and indirect searches of dark matter. Our results highlight the excellent prospect for a Tera-$Z$ run to indirectly probe the presence and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Deep learning approaches to top FCNC couplings to photons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of the LHC to flavour-changing neutral current interactions involving the top quark and a photon using a model-independent effective field theory framework, focusing on two complementary processes: single top production via $qg \to t\gamma$ and the rare decay $t \to q\gamma$ in top pair events. To enhance signal discrimination, we employ a range of deep learning classifiers, including multi-layer perceptrons, graph attention networks and transformers, and compare them against a traditional cut-based analysis. Our results demonstrate that attention-based architectures, in particular transformer networks, significantly outperform other strategies, yielding up to a factor of five improvement in the expected exclusion limits. In particular, we show that at the high-luminosity LHC, rare top branching ratios can be probed down to values as low as $10^{-6}$. Our results thus highlight the significant potential of attention-based architectures for improving the sensitivity to new physics signatures in top quark processes at colliders.</description>

      <title>Decoding the proton's gluonic density with lattice QCD-informed machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first machine learning-based decoding of the gluonic structure of the proton from lattice QCD using a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). Harnessing the power of generative AI, we predict the parton distribution function (PDF) of the gluon given information on the reduced pseudo-Ioffe-time distributions (RpITDs) as calculated from an ensemble with lattice spacing $a\! \approx\! 0.09$ fm and a pion mass of $M_\pi\! \approx\! 310$ MeV. The resulting gluon PDF is consistent with phenomenological global fits within uncertainties, particularly in the intermediate-to-high-$x$ region where lattice data are most constraining. A subsequent correlation analysis confirms that the VAIM learns a meaningful latent representation, highlighting the potential of generative AI to bridge lattice QCD and phenomenological extractions within a unified analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Charm rescattering in $B^0\to K^0\bar{\ell}\ell$: an improved analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve upon previous explicit estimates of charm rescattering contributions to the decay $B^0\to K^0\bar{\ell}\ell$ by including contributions from dipole interactions with the intermediate charm-meson states, and by further investigating the structure of the electromagnetic form factors. Using a model of fundamental meson fields inspired by heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory, augmented by form factors motivated by theoretical considerations as well as experimental data, we provide a thorough investigation of rescattering contributions induced by intermediate $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}_s$ states.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with trapped-ion interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how recent advances in the manipulation of single-ion wave packets open new avenues for detecting weak magnetic fields sourced by ultralight dark matter. A trapped ion in a ``Schr\"odinger cat'' state can be prepared with its spin and motional degrees of freedom entangled and be used as a matter-wave interferometer that is sensitive to the Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shift accumulated by the ion over its trajectory. The result of the spin-motion entanglement is a parametrically-enhanced sensitivity to weak magnetic fields as compared with an un-entangled ion in a trap. Taking into account the relevant boundary conditions, we demonstrate that a single trapped ion can probe unexplored regions of kinetically-mixed dark-photon dark matter parameter space in the $10^{-15}~\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-14}$~eV mass window. We also show how such a table-top quantum device will also serve as a complementary probe of axion-like particle dark matter in the same mass window.</description>

      <title>An Efficient On-shell Framework for EFT Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an on-shell framework for matching ultraviolet (UV) theories to low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) at loop level, based on the unitary cut method. By promoting unitarity double-cuts to $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions, the constructible integrands incorporate both branch-cut components and rational terms. The unconstructible parts, such as tadpoles and kinematically independent bubbles, are proved to be unnecessary for EFT matching. In this framework, all requisite loop amplitudes are constructed by sewing a pair of on-shell tree-level amplitudes. Consequently, the method eliminates complications from gauge fixing and ghost fields inherent in traditional loop calculations, while also avoiding supplementary efforts to construct rational terms and implement generalized unitarity cuts for master integral coefficient extraction required in conventional on-shell approaches. This yields a more efficient and systematic methodology. Furthermore, UV amplitudes are systematically matched to a complete set of on-shell amplitude bases via large mass expansion, bypassing concerns about operator redundancies or gauge invariance issues inherent in traditional matching methods. Therefore, this framework can be more easily implemented in programs.</description>

      <title>Multiple Populations of Same Sterile Neutrino as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos produced in the early Universe that mix with active neutrinos of the Standard Model are typically considered to consist of a single population resulting from one dominant production mechanism. We show that the same sterile neutrino species can naturally emerge with multiple population components, yielding a multi-modal relic momentum spectrum. We consider this with four distinct production scenarios: active-sterile non-resonant oscillations following resonant oscillations in the presence of a primordial lepton asymmetry, gravitational production through sterile neutrinogenesis from populations of evaporating primordial black holes, and heavy singlet Higgs or inflaton decays combined with non-resonant active-sterile oscillations or neutrinogenesis. We identify sterile neutrino mass ranges where a colder and a hotter population can be present with similar contributions and can also contribute non-negligibly to the dark matter relic abundance. We discuss some potential consequences of such a multi-population framework.</description>

      <title>On Focusing Statistical Power for Searches and Measurements in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle physics experiments rely on the (generalised) likelihood ratio test (LRT) for searches and measurements, which consist of composite hypothesis tests. However, this test is not guaranteed to be optimal, as the Neyman-Pearson lemma pertains only to simple hypothesis tests. Any choice of test statistic thus implicitly determines how statistical power varies across the parameter space. An improvement in the core statistical testing methodology for general settings with composite tests would have widespread ramifications across experiments. We discuss an alternate test statistic that provides the data analyzer an ability to focus the power of the test on physics-motivated regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate the improvement from this technique compared to the LRT on a Higgs $\rightarrow\tau\tau$ dataset simulated by the ATLAS experiment and a dark matter dataset inspired by the LZ experiment. We also employ machine learning to efficiently perform the Neyman construction, which is essential to ensure statistically valid confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>On the addition of an $SU(2)$ quadruplet of scalars to the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the extension of the Standard Model through an $SU(2)$ quadruplet of scalars with hypercharge either $0$, $3/2$, or $1/2$ (with an additional reflection symmetry in the latter case). We establish, through exact analytical equations, the boundaries of the phase spaces of the gauge-invariant terms that appear in the (renormalizable) scalar potentials. We devise procedures for the determination of necessary and sufficient bounded-from-below conditions on those potentials.</description>

      <title>Endpoint Factorization for Semileptonic Decays of Boosted and Resonant Off-Shell Top Quarks with a Fat Bottom Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a factorization formula for boosted double resonant top-antitop pair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation with a semileptonic top quark decay in the phase space region where the $b$-jet invariant mass is small. The decaying top quark state is defined through invariant mass measurements on the final states in the top and antitop hemispheres, and the $b$-jet is defined from clustering all hadrons in the top hemisphere. The factorization does not rely on the narrow width limit and accounts for the QCD off-shell and interference effects. The approach employs Soft-Collinear-Effective Theory and boosted Heavy-Quark-Effective-Theory and relies on a combination of factorization theorems known from $e^+e^-$ dijet production and inclusive semileptonic heavy meson endpoint decays. The result provides a first principles treatment of the dominant hadronization effects, which can be determined from $e^+e^-$ event shapes. In the factorization a new distribution function arises, called the ultra-collinear-soft (ucs) function, which encodes the Fermi motion of the decaying top quark within the state defined from the invariant mass measurement. The ucs function is a differential generalization of the inclusive bHQET jet function and shares properties of the shape function in semileptonic heavy meson decays. In frames where the top quark is very slow, it describes the coherent soft radiation arising from top production, propagation and decay, and encodes all effects that are non-factorizable from the perspective of the NW limit. Its form and renormalization depend on two light-cone momenta related to the top-jet and and $b$-jet directions and their relative angle. Due to the large top quark width, the ucs function can be computed perturbatively, and we determine the QCD corrections at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$. The anomalous dimension is known to three loops.</description>

      <title>Constraints on millicharged particles from nuclear gamma-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nuclear gamma decays and $\gamma$-emitting reactions that can be an efficient source of hypothetical millicharged particles ($\chi$). In particular, we revisit the production of millicharged particles in nuclear reactor environment, pointing out that $\gamma$ cascades from $^{239}$U is an overlooked yet a powerful source of $\chi\bar\chi$ pairs. This leads to an increased flux compared to previous studies. We then apply new estimates of the flux to derive novel limits on the value of millicharge, $\varepsilon = Q_\chi/e$, from the electron recoil searched for in a variety of experiments placed in proximity to the reactor cores. The derived limits on $\varepsilon$ are the strongest in the interval of masses $\sim 0.7-2 $\,MeV. We also derive the MCP flux from the Sun and point out potential sensitivity of the low-threshold dark matter search experiments.</description>

      <title>Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral phase transition in QCD-like theories can be Coleman-Weinberg type supercooling. This is possible to see when Beyond the Standard Model (say, axionlike particle or baryogenesis) is coupled to QCD of the Standard Model (called ordinary QCD). Identifying such a supecooling chiral phase transition thus opens a new window to search for new physics associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history, to be probed by gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. We discuss this possibility by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in hot and/or dense medium, at the mean-field approximation level. We find that the identification essentially follows the scale violation classification: soft-scale breaking and quantum scale anomaly.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Skewness Dependence of Quark Wigner Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the skewness dependence of quark Wigner distributions within the light-front dressed quark model. While previous studies have largely focused on the forward limit, we explore the impact of nonzero longitudinal momentum transfer (\(\xi \neq 0\)) on the full set of leading-twist quark Wigner distributions across various polarization configurations. We observe characteristic distortions in the spatial and momentum correlations with increasing skewness, including the emergence of dipole and quadrupole patterns, asymmetries, and localization effects. These features reflect spin-orbit correlations and quantum interference between light-front wave function components with differing orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Light hybrid baryons in QCD sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the mass spectra of nucleon and delta hybrid baryons with both positive-parity and negative-parity by using the method of QCD sum rules. We predicte that the lowest-lying hybrid baryons are the negative-parity $N_{1/2^-}$ and $\Delta_{1/2^-}$ states, while the positive-parity ones are much heavier. We suggest to search for these light hybrid baryons via the $\chi_{cJ}/\Upsilon$ decay processes in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of renormalon ambiguities in the context of quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs) defined using gradient-flowed fields. We examine how this impacts the UV and IR renomalons. Using the large $\beta_0$ approximation, we find that UV renormalons for zero external momentum quasi-PDF are eliminated by the flow, while IR renormalons persist but are modified at finite flow time. Moreover, we observe that large numerical coefficients associated with flowed operators can enhance power-suppressed contributions, making higher-dimensional operators non-negligible even at small flow times.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence relations for structure functions emerging at the Siegert point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burkhardt--Cottingham sum rule is an exact superconvergence relation for a spin-structure function, derived from general principles of light absorption and scattering, and valid at any momentum transfer $Q^2$. I illustrate how a class of such relations emerges from the Siegert point, an unphysical kinematical point where both the probe and the target are at rest. From light-by-light scattering, a new sum rule for $\gamma^\ast \gamma^\ast$ fusion is emerging , valid for arbitrary photon virtualities. When one of the photons becomes real, this sum rule reproduces the known relations for the photon spin-structure functions. Regarding the convergence of these relations, I present a simple argument for the suppression of longitudinal photon polarizations at high energy. Among its consequences is the prediction of $\sigma_L/ \sigma_T \to 0$ at high energy, for the ratio of unpolarized nucleon photoabsorption cross sections.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces\,: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains\,: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (136\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref. [1] and can be compared with the one $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$ using the most precise Lattice result. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM}= (120\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by reviewing our predictions on the LO HVP contributions to the $\tau$ anomaly $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3495\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $and to $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2766\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours obtained in Ref.[1].</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_c(2910)$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)$ productions in association with $D_{s0}^{\ast }(2317)^-$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^-$ via $K^- p$ scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the productions of $\Lambda_c(2910)$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)$ in association with $D_{s0}^{\ast }(2317)^-$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^-$ via $K^- p$ scattering, where we assign $\Lambda_c(2910)$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)$ as $D^\ast N$ molecular states with $J^P$ quantum numbers to be $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$, respectively, while treating $D_{s0}^{\ast }(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ as $S-$wave $DK$ and $D^\ast K$ molecular states, respectively. Utilizing an effective Lagrangian approach, we evaluated the cross sections for $K^-p \to D^{\ast}_{s0}(2317)^- \Lambda_{c}(2910) / \Lambda_{c}(2940)$ and $K^-p \to D_{s1}(2460)^{-} \Lambda_{c}(2910) / \Lambda_{c}(2940)$. Our estimations at $p_K=20$ GeV yield the following cross sections: \begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma(K^-p \to D^{\ast}_{s0}(2317)^- \Lambda_{c}(2910)) &amp;=&amp;\left(1.681^{+4.643}_{-1.296}\right)\ \mathrm{nb}, \nonumber
  \sigma(K^-p \to D^{\ast}_{s0}(2317)^- \Lambda_{c}(2940)) &amp;=&amp; \left(49.07^{+136.30}_{-37.86}\right)\ \mathrm{nb}, \nonumber
  \sigma(K^-p \to D_{s1}(2460)^{-} \Lambda_{c}(2910)) &amp;=&amp;\left(84.46^{+238.6}_{-65.35}\right)\ \mathrm{nb}, \nonumber
  \sigma(K^-p \to D_{s1}(2460)^{-} \Lambda_{c}(2940)) &amp;=&amp;\left(13.71^{+38.85}_{-10.61}\right)\ \mathrm{nb}, \nonumber \end{eqnarray} where the central values are estimated with $\Lambda_r=1.1$ GeV, while the uncertainties come from the variation of $\Lambda_r$ from 1.0 to 1.2 GeV. However, the ratios of the cross sections for the considered processes are evaluate to be very weakly dependent on the model parameters. In addition, the differential cross sections for the relevant processes are evaluated, and our estimations indicate that these differential cross sections reach the maximum at the forward angle limit.</description>

      <title>Fresh look at the LHC limits on vector leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector leptoquarks (vLQs) are popular candidates for searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we present updated exclusion limits on various vLQ species, accounting for all the relevant production mechanisms at the LHC. In particular, we highlight the critical role of indirect production and its interference with the Standard Model Drell-Yan process. This interference can be constructive or destructive, depending on the specific quantum numbers of the vLQ, and significantly impacts the sensitivity of current searches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including QCD-QED mixed pair production channels leads to a noticeable shift in model-independent mass limits. Additionally, we examine the validity of the full theory with vLQs and corresponding effective operators in the high mass regime. Overall, our analysis yields a substantial improvement in the exclusion limits on vLQs compared to the existing results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quark and lepton mixing in the asymptotically safe Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark mixing (CKM) matrix is near-diagonal, whereas the lepton mixing (PMNS) matrix is not. We learn that both observations can generically be explained within an ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model with gravity. We find that certain relations between CKM matrix elements should hold approximately because of asymptotically safe regimes, including $|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2 \approx 1$ and $|V_{cd}|^2+|V_{cs}|^2\approx 1$. Theoretically, the accuracies of these relations determine the length of the asymptotically safe regimes. Experimental data confirms these relations with an accuracy of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. This difference in accuracies is also expected, because the ultraviolet completion consists in a fixed-point cascade during which one relation is established already much deeper in the ultraviolet. This results in $|V_{ub}|^2 &lt; |V_{cb}|^2$ and translates into measurable properties of $B$-mesons.
  Similar results would hold for the PMNS matrix, if neutrino Yukawa couplings were large. The ultraviolet complete theory therefore must -- and in fact can -- avoid such an outcome. It contains a mechanism that dynamically limits the size of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Below an upper bound on the sum of Dirac neutrino masses, this allows the PMNS matrix to avoid a near-diagonal structure like the CKM matrix. Thus, large neutrino mixing is intimately tied to small Dirac neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim {\mathcal{O}} (1)\, \rm eV$ and a mass gap in the Standard Model fermion masses.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton density in the $N \rightarrow \Delta$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized parton distributions for transitions between baryon states with different masses have a forward limit in which they behave as parton densities (light-front momentum transfer $\Delta^+, \Delta_T = 0$, energy transfer $\Delta^- \neq 0$). These "transition parton densities'' can realize spin/isospin quantum numbers not accessible in the ground-state nucleon. The $N \rightarrow \Delta$ transition gives rise to a new parton density proportional to the $1/2 \rightarrow 3/2$ spin transition tensor. Its properties are derived, and its magnitude is estimated in the chiral quark-soliton model based on the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD.</description>

      <title>Study of $\Lambda p$ and $\bar{\Lambda} p$ scatterings via quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent BESIII measurements of the $\Lambda p \to \Lambda p$ and $\bar{\Lambda} p \to \bar{\Lambda} p$ scattering processes, we investigate these reactions within the framework of the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation using an effective Lagrangian approach. The interaction potentials are constructed via a one-boson-exchange model incorporating pseudoscalar, scalar, and vector meson exchanges, along with coupled-channel effects from the $\Sigma N$ and $\bar{\Sigma} N$ channels. For the $\Lambda p \to \Lambda p$ reaction, the total cross sections from threshold up to $\sqrt{s} = 2.5~\text{GeV}$ are well reproduced. A mild enhancement near the $\Sigma N$ threshold is attributed to coupled-channel dynamics. Using parameters constrained by the total cross section data, our model also predicts differential cross sections at $\sqrt{s} = 2.24~\text{GeV}$, which exhibit weak angular dependence, consistent with experimental observations. Partial-wave analysis indicates that the $1^+$ partial wave dominates over the entire energy range, while the $0^+$ wave plays a significant role near threshold. For the $\bar{\Lambda} p \to \bar{\Lambda} p$ reaction, our predicted total cross sections show good agreement with the BESIII data. The $1^-$ partial wave is found to dominate in most of the energy region. Notably, the calculated differential cross sections exhibit a strong forward peaking behavior, consistent with experimental findings and understood as resulting from constructive interference among various partial waves. This forward-peaked angular distribution persists across a range of energies, highlighting the distinct dynamics of the $\bar{\Lambda} p$ interaction.</description>

      <title>New contribution to the anomalous $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ decay in SU(2) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of axions gives rise to additional one-loop diagrams for the two-photon decays of neutral pions via axion-pion mixing. We compute this correction that has been overlooked in existing calculations, within the framework of SU(2) chiral perturbation theory. Our analysis shows that the correction is proportional to the axion-photon coupling and the square of the axion mass. In the classical axion parameter space, this correction is strongly suppressed by the axion decay constant. However, for QCD axions in the MeV or higher mass range, the correction may become significant. Furthermore, when combined with experimental measurements of the decay width of the $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process, our results rule out the standard QCD axion as a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy between chiral perturbation theory predictions and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor neutrino oscillations using the Phase Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Phase-Space Approximation (PSA) approach, originally applied in [Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino oscillations from a stellar object in the two-flavor limit, is extended here to describe the more realistic case where neutrinos can oscillate between three different flavors. The approach is successfully validated against the exact solutions up to eight neutrinos. In all cases where the exact solution is feasible, the PSA provides excellent reproduction of the neutrino oscillation dynamics. By replacing the full problem with a set of simple mean-field equations, the PSA offers a versatile, predictive, and easily parallelizable approach for tackling three-flavor problems. This enables the simulation of large-scale neutrino oscillations, as illustrated here with simulations involving up to 300 neutrinos. Additionally, the method provides insight into the system's equilibration properties.</description>

      <title>Resonant enhancement of axion dark matter decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion is particularly well motivated candidate for the dark matter comprising most of the mass of our visible Universe, leading to worldwide experimental and observational efforts towards its discovery. As is well known, resonant cavities are a primary tool in this search, where they are used to enhance the conversion rate of axions into photons in a background electromagnetic field. What is perhaps less well appreciated is that resonant cavities can also enhance the rate at which axions decay to two photons, a manifestation of the Purcell effect. We explore this possibility and show that it offers a novel method to search the axion parameter space in a way that is competitive and complimentary to other approaches, with the capability to probe the most-favoured region for QCD axion dark matter. Furthermore, we establish that this method can be implemented via pre-existing axion heterodyne detection schemes, enabling such experiments to perform these searches with minimal modification.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the $\rm S, T, U$ parameters and their impact on the $W$ boson mass in the 331 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate radiative corrections to electroweak precision observables, specifically the Peskin--Takeuchi parameters $\mathrm{S}$, $\mathrm{T}$, and $\mathrm{U}$, in the $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ (331) model with $\beta = -\sqrt{3}$. Using the SARAH and SPheno packages, we compute the mass spectrum and low-energy observables. We show that these parameters place strong constraints on the model, requiring most of the scalar masses to lie in the TeV range or below, and imposing indirect bounds on the newly predicted gauge bosons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can accommodate the $W$ boson mass anomaly reported by the CDF collaboration, should future measurements confirm its persistence.</description>

      <title>Is the $3S$-$2D$ mixing strong for the charmonia $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the $3S$-$2D$ mixing scheme for the charmonia $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$. We introduce a coupled-channel mechanism-distinct from the tensor-force contribution in potential models, which alone is insufficient to induce significant mixing-to describe the mixing between these states. Our analysis yields mixing angles of $\theta_1=7^\circ$ and $\theta_2=10^\circ$, inconsistent with the larger angle inferred from experimental data, such as the di-lectronic widths of the $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$. We discuss possible origins of this discrepancy and emphasize the need for future experiments to resolve it. Precise measurements of the resonance parameters and di-lectronic decay widths, via both inclusive and exclusive processes, will be crucial in clarifying this issue.</description>

      <title>Rapidity-Dependent Spin Decomposition of the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) has two distinct interpretations: at zero skewness ($\eta=0$) it yields the familiar impact-parameter density, while at finite skewness ($\eta \neq 0$) it encodes a genuine parton-nucleon correlation whose norm decreases predictably with the rapidity gap $\Delta y = 2\mathrm{artanh} \eta$. This rapidity dependence produces universal rapidity-modified Ji identities linking helicity, orbital, and total angular momenta analytically. Using linear open- and closed string Regge trajectories constrained by empirical PDFs, spectroscopy and form factor data, we obtain the leading twist GPDs $H,E,\widetilde{H}$ across the full $(x,\eta,t)$ range. Numerical Mellin Barnes inversion agrees with existing lattice data and yields rapidity resolved predictions for Jefferson Lab 12 GeV, the Electron Ion Collider, and forthcoming lattice studies.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to the strong CP problem based on P or CP symmetries are typically framed using the Lagrangian formalism. In this work, we analyze the strong CP phase in QCD from the Hamiltonian perspective, focusing on the invariance of the Hamiltonian H under P (or a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$). For $\mathcal{P}$ to be a physical symmetry, it must preserve the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum (i.e., $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$). This requirement implies that the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} = \theta + \arg \det M$ must vanish, i.e., $\theta$ must cancel the phase of the quark mass matrix $M$. Equivalently, we show that this condition follows from requiring that parity commute with the large gauge transformation operator of QCD.</description>

      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources. Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier point-source analyses of the GCE.</description>

      <title>Analytic Regression of Feynman Integrals from High-Precision Numerical Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mathematics or theoretical physics one is often interested in obtaining an exact analytic description of some data which can be produced, in principle, to arbitrary accuracy. For example, one might like to know the exact analytical form of a definite integral. Such problems are not well-suited to numerical symbolic regression, since typical numerical methods lead only to approximations. However, if one has some sense of the function space in which the analytic result should lie, it is possible to deduce the exact answer by judiciously sampling the data at a sufficient number of points with sufficient precision. We demonstrate how this can be done for the computation of Feynman integrals. We show that by combining high-precision numerical integration with analytic knowledge of the function space one can often deduce the exact answer using lattice reduction. A number of examples are given as well as an exploration of the trade-offs between number of datapoints, number of functional predicates, precision of the data, and compute. This method provides a bottom-up approach that neatly complements the top-down Landau-bootstrap approach of trying to constrain the exact answer using the analytic structure alone. Although we focus on the application to Feynman integrals, the techniques presented here are more general and could apply to a wide range of problems where an exact answer is needed and the function space is sufficiently well understood.</description>

      <title>Not-quite-primordial black holes seeded by cosmic string loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.</description>

      <title>Matter Spectral Functions from Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Lorentzian quantum gravity coupled to a template matter sector with gauge fields, scalars and fermions. In the absence of quantised gravity, the matter sector by itself is renormalisable, but UV-incomplete. Provided quantum gravity offers an asymptotically safe UV-completion, we determine the photon and scalar two-point functions in the presence of gravitational fluctuations, and show that both possess a K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral representation. Our results are achieved using functional renormalisation adapted for theories in Lorentzian signature. We explain why and how interactions with gravity modify both the infrared as well as the ultraviolet behaviour of matter spectral functions. We further determine the corresponding form factors on the level of the quantum effective action. Limitations and extensions of our study are discussed alongside implications for particle physics and unitarity of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on modified gravity from binary pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity (GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars, namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars (PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we find that our results are consistent with GR.</description>

      <title>New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of the emergent spacetime in the polarized IKKT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IKKT matrix model has been investigated as a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. One of the recent developments concerning this model is the discovery of the dual supergravity solution corresponding to the model obtained after supersymmetry-preserving mass deformation, which is dubbed the polarized IKKT model. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of this model in the case of matrix size N = 2 for a wide range of the deformation parameter Omega. While we reproduce precisely the known result for the partition function obtained by the localization method developed for supersymmetric theories, we also calculate the observables, which were not accessible by previous work, in order to probe the spacetime structure emergent from the dominant matrix configurations. In particular, we find that the saddle point corresponding to the original IKKT model is smoothly connected to the saddle represented by the fuzzy sphere dominant at large Omega, whereas the dominant configurations become diverging commuting matrices at small Omega.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-Lifetime Correlations in Entangled Hyperon-AntiHyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical spin correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies have focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose two data-driven tests - relative and absolute lifetime correlations - for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Delta t and constructing a pair-wise lifetime correlator, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Successful observation of lifetime correlations between entangled partners would demand a fundamental revision of quantum mechanics' framework for entanglement, extending the concept beyond its current theoretical boundaries.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment $a_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a_\mu=a_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, electroweak precision measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a_\mu$ with new scalar and lepton mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and the lepton triplet, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for pile-up removal of $pp$ interactions using variational inference with diffusion models, called vipr. Instead of using classification methods to identify which particles are from the primary collision, a generative model is trained to predict the constituents of the hard-scatter particle jets with pile-up removed. This results in an estimate of the full posterior over hard-scatter jet constituents, which has not yet been explored in the context of pile-up removal, yielding a clear advantage over existing methods especially in the presence of imperfect detector efficiency. We evaluate the performance of vipr in a sample of jets from simulated $t\bar{t}$ events overlain with pile-up contamination. vipr outperforms softdrop and has comparable performance to puppiml in predicting the substructure of the hard-scatter jets over a wide range of pile-up scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-Violating Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings at Electron-Positron Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the CP-violating (CPV) neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) that can be realized via dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We present a new formulation of the CPV nTGC form factors that is compatible with spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry, and show how these CPV form factors can be matched consistently with the corresponding dimension-8 CPV nTGC operators in the broken phase. We then study probes of the CPV nTGCs at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders with centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=(0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5)$TeV respectively, demonstrating that the $e^{\mp}$ beam polarizations can help to improve the sensitivities of probes of the nTGCs. We estimate that the sensitivity reaches for probing the new physics scales of nTGCs can range from ${O}(\rm{TeV})$ at a 250GeV $e^+e^-$ collider to ${O}(10\,\rm{TeV})$ at an $e^+e^-$ collider of energy $(3-5)$TeV, and that the sensitivities to the nTGC form factors vary from ${O}(10^{-4})$ to ${O}(10^{-6}-10^{-8})$ for the $e^+e^-$ collision energy from 250GeV to $(3-5)$TeV.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the neutrino in the N-B-LSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-loop corrections to the neutrino mass matrix in the N-B-LSSM. We obtain the N-B-LSSM from the $U(1)$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). By adding three generation right-handed neutrino superfields and three Higgs singlets, the model generates tiny neutrino masses at the tree level through the first type seesaw mechanism. However, one-loop corrections are essential for understanding neutrino masses and mixing angles. In our calculations, the one-loop corrections contribute approximately 10\% to the total result. We calculate the neutrino mass variance and mixing angle from both normal order neutrino mass spectrum and inverse order neutrino mass spectrum. Crucially, these corrections are 3-5 times larger than current experimental uncertainties. And they have implications for future neutrino oscillation experiments. This study provides new theoretical support for exploring the mechanism of neutrino mass generation in the supersymmetric model and provides clues for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).</description>

Abstract: We derive new constraint on millicharged dark matter from the multimessenger observation of GW170817. In the neutron star merger event GW170817, the first detection of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) delayed by approximately 1.7 seconds relative to the gravitational wave emission was observed. Utilizing this delay, we constrain the millicharge parameter of dark matter within the large-scale structure of the Universe. {For dark matter mass below $10^{-15}$ eV, the millicharge parameter $\epsilon$ is constrained to be less than $10^{-14}$, representing the most stringent limits achieved to date.</description>

      <title>Constraining ALP-Top Interaction from the Chromoelectric Dipole Moment of the Top Quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The couplings of axion-like particles (ALPs) to Standard Model fermions are proportional to the fermion masses, making the interaction with the top quark particularly significant. In this study, we consider an ALP that is a mixture of CP-even and CP-odd components, thereby introducing CP violation. This CP violation, in turn, gives rise to electric dipole moments (EDMs) of quarks and leptons, as well as chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) of quarks. We compute the one-loop and two-loop contributions to the top quark CEDM induced by the ALP. In our calculation, we treat the external gluon as off-shell with momentum $q^2 \neq 0$, derive the analytical results, and finally evaluate the top quark CEDM at $q^2 = m_t^2$, corresponding to the top quark pole mass. This value is relevant for subsequent calculations of the EDMs of the neutron and mercury. By applying current experimental bounds on EDMs and CEDMs, we derive constraints on the ALP-top quark coupling, with the strongest limit coming from the neutron EDM.</description>

      <title>Quantum querying based on multicontrolled Toffoli gates for causal Feynman loop configurations and directed acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are a promising framework for unfolding the causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams, which is equivalent to querying the \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) configurations of undirected graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for querying in both types of applications, using a systematic and sparing logic in the design of an oracle operator. The construction of the quantum oracle is based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli (MCX) gates and quantum NOT (Pauli-$X$) gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated by comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of traspilation and introduce an appropriate metric to assess the complexity of the algorithm, the \emph{quantum circuit area}. We explicitly analyse three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not previously been explored due to their higher complexity and the current limitations of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis of electromagnetic properties of the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of radiative corrections in low energy nuclear physics is beginning to receive more scrutiny. We examine the impact of these corrections for the deuteron charge form factor and the radiative capture process $np \to d \gamma$ through the velocity renormalization group. In both cases, we find percent level shifts in the relevant observables after evolving the subtraction velocity to the typical velocity of nucleons in the bound state. This suggests that electromagnetic corrections constitute a non-negligible source of uncertainty in existing few-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This letter explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <title>Core-Corona Decomposition of Very Compact (Neutron) Stars: Accounting for Current Data of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>
