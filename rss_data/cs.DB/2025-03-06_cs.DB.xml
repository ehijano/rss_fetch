      <title>TreeCat: Standalone Catalog Engine for Large Data Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With ever increasing volume and heterogeneity of data, advent of new specialized compute engines, and demand for complex use cases, large scale data systems require a performant catalog system that can satisfy diverse needs. We argue that existing solutions, including recent lakehouse storage formats, have fundamental limitations and that there is a strong motivation for a specialized database engine, dedicated to serve as the catalog. We present the design and implementation of TreeCat, a database engine that features a hierarchical data model with a path-based query language, a storage format optimized for efficient range queries and versioning, and a correlated scan operation that enables fast query execution. A key performance challenge is supporting concurrent read and write operations from many different clients while providing strict consistency guarantees. To this end, we present a novel MVOCC (multi-versioned optimistic concurrency control) protocol that guarantees serializable isolation. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing our concurrency control scheme with prior techniques, and evaluating our overall system against Hive Metastore, Delta Lake, and Iceberg.</description>

      <title>Information Theory Strikes Back: New Development in the Theory of Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the cardinality of the output of a query is a fundamental problem in database query processing.
  In this article, we overview a recently published contribution that casts the cardinality estimation problem as linear optimization and computes guaranteed upper bounds on the cardinality of the output for any full conjunctive query. The objective of the linear program is to maximize the joint entropy of the query variables and its constraints are the Shannon information inequalities and new information inequalities involving $\ell_p$-norms of the degree sequences of the join attributes.
  The bounds based on arbitrary norms can be asymptotically lower than those based on the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms, which capture the cardinalities and respectively the max-degrees of the input relations. They come with a matching query evaluation algorithm, are computable in exponential time in the query size, and are provably tight when each degree sequence is on one join attribute.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Model for Attributions in Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of narratives as a means of fusing information from knowledge graphs (KGs) into a coherent line of argumentation has been the subject of recent investigation. Narratives are especially useful in event-centric knowledge graphs in that they provide a means to connect different real-world events and categorize them by well-known narrations. However, specifically for controversial events, a problem in information fusion arises, namely, multiple viewpoints regarding the validity of certain event aspects, e.g., regarding the role a participant takes in an event, may exist. Expressing those viewpoints in KGs is challenging because disputed information provided by different viewpoints may introduce inconsistencies. Hence, most KGs only feature a single view on the contained information, hampering the effectiveness of narrative information access. This paper is an extension of our original work and introduces attributions, i.e., parameterized predicates that allow for the representation of facts that are only valid in a specific viewpoint. For this, we develop a conceptual model that allows for the representation of viewpoint-dependent information. As an extension, we enhance the model by a conception of viewpoint-compatibility. Based on this, we deepen our original deliberations on the model's effects on information fusion and provide additional grounding in the literature.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Matcher: Leveraging Large Models to Reduce Uncertainty in Schema Matching Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schema matching is the process of identifying correspondences between the elements of two given schemata, essential for database management systems, data integration, and data warehousing. For datasets across different scenarios, the optimal schema matching algorithm is different. For single algorithm, hyperparameter tuning also cases multiple results. All results assigned equal probabilities are stored in probabilistic databases to facilitate uncertainty management. The substantial degree of uncertainty diminishes the efficiency and reliability of data processing, thereby precluding the provision of more accurate information for decision-makers. To address this problem, we introduce a new approach based on fine-grained correspondence verification with specific prompt of Large Language Model.
  Our approach is an iterative loop that consists of three main components: (1) the correspondence selection algorithm, (2) correspondence verification, and (3) the update of probability distribution. The core idea is that correspondences intersect across multiple results, thereby linking the verification of correspondences to the reduction of uncertainty in candidate results.
  The task of selecting an optimal correspondence set to maximize the anticipated uncertainty reduction within a fixed budgetary framework is established as an NP-hard problem. We propose a novel $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm that significantly outperforms brute algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. To enhance correspondence verification, we have developed two prompt templates that enable GPT-4 to achieve state-of-the-art performance across two established benchmark datasets. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Interactive Data Harmonization with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.</description>
