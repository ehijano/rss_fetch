      <title>DiffTex: Differentiable Texturing for Architectural Proxy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering. However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Exploiting the Time Course of Chromatic Adaptation for Display Power Optimizations in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a gaze-tracking--free method to reduce OLED display power consumption in VR with minimal perceptual impact. This technique exploits the time course of chromatic adaptation, the human visual system's ability to maintain stable color perception under changing illumination. To that end, we propose a novel psychophysical paradigm that models how human adaptation state changes with the scene illuminant. We exploit this model to compute an optimal illuminant shift trajectory, controlling the rate and extent of illumination change, to reduce display power under a given perceptual loss budget. Our technique significantly improves the perceptual quality over prior work that applies illumination shifts instantaneously. Our technique can also be combined with prior work on luminance dimming to reduce display power by 31% with no statistical loss of perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>Automated design of compound lenses with discrete-continuous optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g., curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type (e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs achievable by automated lens design.</description>

      <title>ZeroScene: A Zero-Shot Framework for 3D Scene Generation from a Single Image and Controllable Texture Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.</description>

      <title>DFG-PCN: Point Cloud Completion with Degree-Flexible Point Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>StrucADT: Generating Structure-controlled 3D Point Clouds with Adjacency Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However, the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation on the ShapeNet dataset.</description>

      <title>Diff-3DCap: Shape Captioning with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>ReLumix: Extending Image Relighting to Video via Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion (SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting control.</description>

      <title>SIG-Chat: Spatial Intent-Guided Conversational Gesture Generation Involving How, When and Where</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</description>

      <title>Neural Visibility of Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods, such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/octree-nn/neural-visibility.</description>

      <title>NeuralPVS: Learned Estimation of Potentially Visible Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time visibility determination in expansive or dynamically changing environments has long posed a significant challenge in computer graphics. Existing techniques are computationally expensive and often applied as a precomputation step on a static scene. We present NeuralPVS, the first deep-learning approach for visibility computation that efficiently determines from-region visibility in a large scene, running at approximately 100 Hz processing with less than $1\%$ missing geometry. This approach is possible by using a neural network operating on a voxelized representation of the scene. The network's performance is achieved by combining sparse convolution with a 3D volume-preserving interleaving for data compression. Moreover, we introduce a novel repulsive visibility loss that can effectively guide the network to converge to the correct data distribution. This loss provides enhanced robustness and generalization to unseen scenes. Our results demonstrate that NeuralPVS outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-time visibility computation.</description>

      <title>Light-SQ: Structure-aware Shape Abstraction with Superquadrics for Generated Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context, primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations. Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce 3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the feasibility of 3D UGC creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control, generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders, trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size, expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency. Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise editing control and identity-consistent results.

      <title>Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

      <title>LayerD: Decomposing Raster Graphic Designs into Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.</description>

      <title>VIRTUS-FPP: Virtual Sensor Modeling for Fringe Projection Profilometry in NVIDIA Isaac Sim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been established as a high-accuracy 3D reconstruction method capable of achieving sub-pixel accuracy. However, this technique faces significant constraints due to complex calibration requirements, bulky system footprint, and sensitivity to environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we present VIRTUS-FPP, the first comprehensive physics-based virtual sensor modeling framework for FPP built in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. By leveraging the physics-based rendering and programmable sensing capabilities of simulation, our framework enables end-to-end modeling from calibration to reconstruction with full mathematical fidelity to the underlying principles of structured light. We conduct comprehensive virtual calibration and validate our system's reconstruction accuracy through quantitative comparison against ground truth geometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to model the virtual system as a digital twin by replicating a physical FPP system in simulation and validating correspondence between virtual and real-world measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that VIRTUS-FPP accurately models optical phenomena critical to FPP and achieves results comparable to real-world systems while offering unprecedented flexibility for system configuration, sensor prototyping, and environmental control. This framework significantly accelerates the development of real-world FPP systems by enabling rapid virtual prototyping before physical implementation.</description>

      <title>Code Arcades: 3d Visualization of Classes, Dependencies and Software Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software visualization seeks to represent software artifacts graphical-ly in two or three dimensions, with the goal of enhancing comprehension, anal-ysis, maintenance, and evolution of the source code. In this context, visualiza-tions employ graphical forms such as dependency structures, treemaps, or time-lines that incorporate repository histories. These visualizations allow software engineers to identify structural patterns, detect complexity hotspots, and infer system behaviors that are difficult to perceive directly from source text. By adopting metaphor-based approaches, visualization tools provide macroscopic overviews while enabling focused inspection of specific program elements, thus offering an accessible means of understanding large-scale systems. The contri-bution of our work lies in three areas. First, we introduce a configurable group-ing mechanism that supports flexible organization of code elements based on arbitrary relationships. Second, we combine fine-grained and coarse-grained software metrics to provide a multi-level perspective on system properties. Third, we present an interactive visualization engine that allows developers to dynamically adjust rendering attributes. Collectively, these advances provide a more adaptable and insightful approach to source code comprehension.</description>

      <title>WireBend-kit: A Computational Design and Fabrication Toolkit for Wirebending Custom 3D Wireframe Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WireBend-kit, a desktop wirebending machine and computational design tool for creating 3D wireframe structures. Combined, they allow users to rapidly and inexpensively create custom 3D wireframe structures from aluminum wire. Our design tool is implemented in freely available software and allows users to generate virtual wireframe designs and assess their fabricability. A path-planning procedure automatically converts the wireframe design into fabrication instructions for our machine while accounting for material elasticity and kinematic error sources. The custom machine costs $293 in parts and can form aluminum wire into 3D wireframe structures through an ordered sequence of feed, bend, and rotate instructions. Our technical evaluation reveals our system's ability to overcome odometrically accumulating errors inherent to wirebending in order to produce accurate 3D structures from inexpensive hardware. Finally, we provide application examples demonstrating the design space enabled by Wirebend-kit.</description>

      <title>UniLat3D: Geometry-Appearance Unified Latents for Single-Stage 3D Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost. In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets, UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&amp; code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/</description>

      <title>Implicit-ARAP: Efficient Handle-Guided Neural Field Deformation via Local Patch Meshing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural fields have emerged as a powerful representation for 3D geometry, enabling compact and continuous modeling of complex shapes. Despite their expressive power, manipulating neural fields in a controlled and accurate manner -- particularly under spatial constraints -- remains an open challenge, as existing approaches struggle to balance surface quality, robustness, and efficiency. We address this by introducing a novel method for handle-guided neural field deformation, which leverages discrete local surface representations to optimize the As-Rigid-As-Possible deformation energy. To this end, we propose the local patch mesh representation, which discretizes level sets of a neural signed distance field by projecting and deforming flat mesh patches guided solely by the SDF and its gradient. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation showing that our method consistently outperforms baselines in deformation quality, robustness, and computational efficiency. We also present experiments that motivate our choice of discretization over marching cubes. By bridging classical geometry processing and neural representations through local patch meshing, our work enables scalable, high-quality deformation of neural fields and paves the way for extending other geometric tasks to neural domains.</description>

      <title>GCDance: Genre-Controlled Music-Driven 3D Full Body Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>SANA-Sprint: One-Step Diffusion with Continuous-Time Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SANA-Sprint, an efficient diffusion model for ultra-fast text-to-image (T2I) generation. SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC). Code and pre-trained models will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>In-2-4D: Inbetweening from Two Single-View Images to 4D Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening to interpolate two single-view images. In contrast to video/4D generation from only text or a single image, our interpolative task can leverage more precise motion control to better constrain the generation. Given two monocular RGB images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D, without making assumptions on the object category, motion type, length, or complexity. To handle such arbitrary and diverse motions, we utilize a foundational video interpolation model for motion prediction. However, large frame-to-frame motion gaps can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To this end, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states while exhibiting significant motions, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct a 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic 3DGS through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine the 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitive experiments as well as a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and design choices.</description>

      <title>ART-DECO: Arbitrary Text Guidance for 3D Detailizer Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in &lt;1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories.</description>

      <title>ODE-GS: Latent ODEs for Dynamic Scene Extrapolation with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ODE-GS, a novel approach that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enable future extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes. Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI.</description>

      <title>ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics. Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.</description>

      <title>3D-LATTE: Latent Space 3D Editing from Textual Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate 3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes and semantic manipulations.</description>

      <title>T2Bs: Text-to-Character Blendshapes via Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present T2Bs, a framework for generating high-quality, animatable character head morphable models from text by combining static text-to-3D generation with video diffusion. Text-to-3D models produce detailed static geometry but lack motion synthesis, while video diffusion models generate motion with temporal and multi-view geometric inconsistencies. T2Bs bridges this gap by leveraging deformable 3D Gaussian splatting to align static 3D assets with video outputs. By constraining motion with static geometry and employing a view-dependent deformation MLP, T2Bs (i) outperforms existing 4D generation methods in accuracy and expressiveness while reducing video artifacts and view inconsistencies, and (ii) reconstructs smooth, coherent, fully registered 3D geometries designed to scale for building morphable models with diverse, realistic facial motions. This enables synthesizing expressive, animatable character heads that surpass current 4D generation techniques.</description>

      <title>WorldForge: Unlocking Emergent 3D/4D Generation in Video Diffusion Model via Training-Free Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent video diffusion models show immense potential for spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich world priors, but this is undermined by limited controllability, poor spatial-temporal consistency, and entangled scene-camera dynamics. Existing solutions, such as model fine-tuning and warping-based repainting, struggle with scalability, generalization, and robustness against artifacts. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. 1) Intra-Step Recursive Refinement injects fine-grained trajectory guidance at denoising steps through a recursive correction loop, ensuring motion remains aligned with the target path. 2) Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. 3) Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across various 3D/4D tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory adherence, geometric consistency, and perceptual quality, outperforming both training-intensive and inference-only baselines.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Light Transport with Gaussian Surfels via Adapted Radiosity for Efficient Relighting and Geometry Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known or unknown lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>ControlHair: Physically-based Video Diffusion for Controllable Dynamic Hair Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics, diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals, and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset, ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic. ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on our website.</description>

      <title>fVDB: A Deep-Learning Framework for Sparse, Large-Scale, and High-Performance Spatial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present fVDB, a novel GPU-optimized framework for deep learning on large-scale 3D data. fVDB provides a complete set of differentiable primitives to build deep learning architectures for common tasks in 3D learning such as convolution, pooling, attention, ray-tracing, meshing, etc.
  fVDB simultaneously provides a much larger feature set (primitives and operators) than established frameworks with no loss in efficiency: our operators match or exceed the performance of other frameworks with narrower scope. Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and spatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory footprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and performance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration structure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse grid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels using a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged tensors.
  Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with existing pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of representative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high resolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and large-scale point cloud reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Model-based Metric 3D Shape and Motion Reconstruction of Wild Bottlenose Dolphins in Drone-Shot Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the metric 3D shape and motion of wild dolphins from monocular video, with the aim of assessing their body condition. While considerable progress has been made in reconstructing 3D models of terrestrial quadrupeds, aquatic animals remain unexplored due to the difficulty of observing them in their natural underwater environment. To address this, we propose a model-based approach that incorporates a transmission model to account for water-induced occlusion. We apply our method to video captured under different sea conditions. We estimate mass and volume, and compare our results to a manual 2D measurements-based method. Additionally, we apply our method to video of captive animals with known ground truth mass. While in our experiments the manual approach is often more accurate, our method demonstrates a distinct advantage when applied to larger specimen. These findings highlight the potential of our method as a scalable and automated alternative for mass and volume estimation of dolphins from monocular video.</description>

      <title>Errors in Stereo Geometry Induce Distance Misperception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMDs) render and present binocular images to create an egocentric, 3D percept to the HMD user. Within this render and presentation pipeline there are potential rendering camera and viewing position errors that can induce deviations in the depth and distance that a user perceives compared to the underlying intended geometry. For example, rendering errors can arise when HMD render cameras are incorrectly positioned relative to the assumed centers of projections of the HMD displays and viewing errors can arise when users view stereo geometry from the incorrect location in the HMD eyebox. In this work we present a geometric framework that predicts errors in distance perception arising from inaccurate HMD perspective geometry and build an HMD platform to reliably simulate render and viewing error in a Quest 3 HMD with eye tracking to experimentally test these predictions. We present a series of five experiments to explore the efficacy of this geometric framework and show that errors in perspective geometry can induce both under- and over-estimations in perceived distance. We further demonstrate how real-time visual feedback can be used to dynamically recalibrate visuomotor mapping so that an accurate reach distance is achieved even if the perceived visual distance is negatively impacted by geometric error.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Generative Personalization with Test-Time Embedding Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept ($V$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V$ wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms such as "a photo of $V$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail to capture the intended concept. We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the learned embedding $V$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in diverse use cases.

      <title>HiMat: DiT-based Ultra-High Resolution SVBRDF Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating ultra-high-resolution spatially varying bidirectional reflectance functions (SVBRDFs) is critical for photorealistic 3D content creation, to faithfully represent fine-scale surface details required for close-up rendering. However, achieving 4K generation faces two key challenges: (1) the need to synthesize multiple reflectance maps at full resolution, which multiplies the pixel budget and imposes prohibitive memory and computational cost, and (2) the requirement to maintain strong pixel-level alignment across maps at 4K, which is particularly difficult when adapting pretrained models designed for the RGB image domain. We introduce HiMat, a diffusion-based framework tailored for efficient and diverse 4K SVBRDF generation. To address the first challenge, HiMat performs generation in a high-compression latent space via DC-AE, and employs a pretrained diffusion transformer with linear attention to improve per-map efficiency. To address the second challenge, we propose CrossStitch, a lightweight convolutional module that enforces cross-map consistency without incurring the cost of global attention. Our experiments show that HiMat achieves high-fidelity 4K SVBRDF generation with superior efficiency, structural consistency, and diversity compared to prior methods. Beyond materials, our framework also generalizes to related applications such as intrinsic decomposition.</description>

      <title>T-MLP: Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron for Level-of-Detail Signal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we propose a novel network architecture that enables LoD signal representation. Our approach builds on a modified Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and thus lacks native LoD support. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP), which extends the MLP by attaching an output branch, also called tail, to each hidden layer. Each tail refines the residual between the current prediction and the ground-truth signal, so that the accumulated outputs across layers correspond to the target signals at different LoDs, enabling multi-scale modeling with supervision from only a single-resolution signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T-MLP outperforms existing neural LoD baselines across diverse signal representation tasks.</description>
