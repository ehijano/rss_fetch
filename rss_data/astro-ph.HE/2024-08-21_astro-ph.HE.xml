      <title>EWOCS-II: X-ray properties of the Wolf-Rayet stars in the young Galactic super star cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most comprehensive and deepest X-ray study to date of the properties of the richest Wolf-Rayet (WR) population observed in a single stellar cluster, Westerlund 1 (Wd1). This work is based on 36 Chandra observations obtained from the "Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey" (EWOCS) project, plus 8 archival Chandra observations. The overall exposure depth (~1.1 Ms) and baseline of the EWOCS observations extending over more than one year enable us to perform a detailed photometric, colour, and spectral analysis, as well as to search for short- and long-term periodicity. In X-rays, we detect 20 out of the 24 known Wolf-Rayet stars in Wd1 down to an observed luminosity of ~7$\times10^{29}$erg s$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 4.23 kpc to Wd1), with 8 WR stars being detected in X-rays for the first time. Nine stars show clear evidence of variability over the year-long baseline, with clear signs of periodicity. The X-ray colours and spectral analysis reveal that the vast majority of the WR stars are hard X-ray sources (kT$\geq$2.0keV). The Fe XXV emission line at ~6.7 keV, which commonly originates from the wind-wind collision zone in binary systems, is detected for the first time in the spectra of 17 WR stars in Wd1. In addition the ~6.4 keV fluorescent line is observed in the spectra of three stars, indicating that dense cold material coexists with the hot gas in these systems. Overall, our X-ray results alone suggest a very high binary fraction ($\geq$80%) for the WR star population in Wd1. When combining our results with properties of the WR population from other wavelengths, we estimate a binary fraction of $\geq$92%, which could even reach unity. This suggests that either all the most massive stars are found in binary systems within Wd1, or that binarity is essential for the formation of such a rich population of WR stars.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the JWST spectra of the kilonova accompanying GRB 230307A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonovae are key to advancing our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis. To date, only two kilonovae have been spectroscopically observed, AT 2017gfo and AT 2023vfi. Here, we present an analysis of the James Webb Space Telescope spectra obtained +29 and +61 days post-merger for AT 2023vfi. After re-reducing and photometrically flux-calibrating the data, we empirically model the observed X-ray to mid-infrared continua with a power law and a blackbody, to replicate the non-thermal afterglow and apparent thermal continuum $\gtrsim 2 \, \mu$m. We fit Gaussians to the apparent emission features, obtaining line centroids of $20218_{-38}^{+37}$, $21874 \pm 89$ and $44168_{-152}^{+153}$\,\AA, and velocity widths spanning $0.057 - 0.110$\,c. These line centroid constraints facilitated a detailed forbidden line identification search, from which we shortlist a number of r-process species spanning all three r-process peaks. We rule out Ba II and Ra II as candidates and propose Te I-III, Er I-III and W III as the most promising ions for further investigation, as they plausibly produce multiple emission features from one (W III) or multiple (Te I-III, Er I-III) ion stages. We compare to the spectra of AT 2017gfo, which also exhibit prominent emission at $\sim 2.1 \, \mu$m, and conclude that [Te III] $\lambda$21050 remains the most plausible cause of the observed $\sim 2.1 \, \mu$m emission in both kilonovae. However, the observed line centroids are not consistent between both objects, and they are significantly offset from [Te III] $\lambda$21050. The next strongest [Te III] transition at 29290\,\AA\ is not observed, and we quantify its detectability. Further study is required, with particular emphasis on expanding the available atomic data to enable quantitative non-LTE spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>A GTC spectroscopic study of three spider pulsar companions: line-based temperatures, a new face-on redback, and improved mass constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GTC-OSIRIS phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of three compact binary MSPs, or `spiders': PSR J1048+2339, PSR J1810+1744, and (for the first time) PSR J1908+2105. For the companion in each system, the temperature is traced throughout its orbit, and radial velocities are measured. The radial velocities are found to vary with the absorption features used when measuring them, resulting in a lower radial velocity curve semi-amplitude measured from the day side of two of the systems when compared to the night: for J1048 ($K_\mathrm{day} = 344 \pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{night} = 372 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$) and, tentatively, for J1810 ($K_\mathrm{day} = 448 \pm 19$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{night} = 491 \pm 32$ km s$^{-1}$). With existing inclination constraints, this gives the neutron star (NS) and companion masses $M_\mathrm{NS} = 1.50 - 2.04$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.32 - 0.40$ $M_\odot$ for J1048, and $M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 1.7$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.05 - 0.08$ $M_\odot$ for J1810. For J1908, we find an upper limit of $K_2 &lt; 32$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains its mass ratio $q = M_2 / M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 0.55$ and inclination $i &lt; 6.0^\circ$, revealing the previously misunderstood system to be the highest mass ratio, lowest inclination redback yet. This raises questions for the origins of its substantial radio eclipses. Additionally, we find evidence of asymmetric heating in J1048 and J1810, and signs of metal enrichment in J1908. We also explore the impact of inclination on spectroscopic temperatures, and demonstrate that the temperature measured at quadrature ($\phi = 0.25, 0.75$) is essentially independent of inclination, and thus can provide additional constraints on photometric modelling.</description>

      <title>Loaded layer-cake model for cosmic ray interaction around exploding super-giant stars making black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AMS experiment on the International Space Station has provided detailed cosmic ray spectra for various elements, revealing that interactions significantly reduce fluxes up to about 100 GV rigidity. This necessitates revisiting current cosmic ray interaction models. A new model proposed here involves cosmic ray interactions first in the wind shock shell of supergiant stars and second in the OB-Superbubble around supernovae. These stars, including red and blue supergiants, produce black holes and drive electric currents in winds and jets. Variability in these winds creates temporary electric fields that accelerate particles, resulting in steep spectra with synchrotron losses, and analogous hadron spectra produce a flat magnetic irregularity spectrum. This model matches AMS data, explaining cosmic ray spectra below 100 GV. The model predicts a secondary/primary ratio slope of -1/3 and a primary flux reduction below 100 GV relative to a power-law spectrum with slope +2. Key aspects are: a larger interaction column due to heavy element enrichment and a minor secondary contribution even for elements like He, C, and O, as indicated by the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio. This model also accounts for cosmic ray anti-protons, gamma-ray spectra, and high-energy neutrinos, including contributions from ISM-SNe.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Central Engine "Breathing" Phenomenon in an Active Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving the inner structures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provides the "standard ruler" to measure the parallax distances of the Universe and a powerful way to weigh supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thanks to time-domain observations, it is possible to use the reverberation mapping (RM) technique to measure time delays between different light curves that probe the structures of the SMBH accretion disks and broad line regions (BLRs), which are otherwise often too compact to be spatially resolved for most AGNs. Despite decades of RM studies, the critical physical process that controls the structures of SMBH accretion disk and BLR and their temporal evolution remains unclear. Here we report the variation of the SMBH accretion disk structure of NGC 4151 in response to changes in luminosity within 6 years. In the high-flux state, the time delays measured from our continuum RM with high-cadence (2 days) spectroscopy are 3.8 times larger than that in the low-flux state and 15 times longer than the classical standard thin disk (SSD) prediction. This result provides the first piece of direct evidence that the SMBH disk structure "breathes" in highly-variable AGN manifestations. The time-delay change severely challenges the popular X-ray reprocessing of the SSD model, with or without BLR contributions. More importantly, the continuum time delays can be comparable with the time delay between the broad Hb line and the nearby optical continuum, and the latter is commonly used to calculate the BLR sizes. Hence, the BLR sizes are significantly underestimated if the continuum time delays are not properly considered. This underestimation introduces up to 0.3 dex systematic uncertainties on RM SMBH masses and BLR parallax distances. Our findings underscore that simultaneous continuum and BLR RM studies are vital for better deciphering the SMBH mass growth and the cosmological expansion history.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger connection in high-energy neutrino astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos at TeV energies and the overwhelming background of atmospheric neutrinos below that, render the current paradigm of neutrino astronomy as a severely statistics limited one. While many hints have emerged, all the evidence gathered by IceCube and ANTARES, over the course of almost a decade and a half of operation, have fallen short of providing any conclusive answer to the puzzle of the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. The advancement of the field is thus closely associated with not only the neutrino observatories coming online in the next few years, but also on the coordinated efforts of the EM, GW and cosmic ray communities to develop dedicated channels and infrastructure that allows for swift and comprehensive multi-messenger follow-up of relevant events detected in any of the sectors. This paper highlights the strides that have been already taken in that direction and the fruits that they have born, as well as the challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background in Search of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB), measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, is the result of several classes of extragalactic astrophysical sources. Those sources include blazars, start-forming galaxies and radio galaxies. Also, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays interacting with the infrared background, contribute to the isotropic background. Using information from Fermi's gamma-ray sources catalog and the results of dedicated studies of these classes of sources, from observations at the infrared and radio, we model their contribution to the IGRB. In addition to conventional astrophysical sources, dark matter may be a component of the IGRB. We combine our model of conventional astrophysical sources and of dark matter annihilation in distant galaxies, marginalizing over relevant uncertainties, to derive constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section, from the measured IGRB. In calculating the contribution from dark matter we include the flux from extragalactic halos and their substructure and also the subdominant contribution from Milky Way's halo at high galactic latitudes. The resulting constraints are competitive with the strongest current constraints from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Under certain dark matter assumptions, we also find an indication for a small excess flux in the isotropic background. Our results are consistent with the gamma-ray excess at GeV energies toward the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Positive and unlabelled machine learning reveals new fast radio burst repeater candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astronomical radio transients of unknown origin. A minority of FRBs have been observed to originate from repeating sources, and it is unknown which apparent one-off bursts are hidden repeaters. Recent studies increasingly suggest that there are intrinsic physical differences between repeating and non-repeating FRBs. Previous research has used machine learning classification techniques to identify apparent non-repeaters with repeater characteristics, whose sky positions would be ideal targets for future observation campaigns. However, these methods have not sufficiently accounted for the positive and unlabelled (PU) nature of the data, wherein true labels are only available for repeaters. Modified techniques that do not inadvertently learn properties of hidden repeaters as characteristic of non-repeaters are likely to identify additional repeater candidates with greater accuracy. We present in this paper the first known attempt at applying PU-specific machine learning techniques to study FRBs. We train an ensemble of five PU-specific classifiers on the available data and use them to identify 66 repeater candidates in burst data from the CHIME/FRB collaboration, 18 of which were not identified with the use of machine learning classifiers in past research. Our results additionally support repeaters and non-repeaters having intrinsically different physical properties, particularly spectral index, frequency width, and burst width. This work additionally opens new possibilities to study repeating and non-repeating FRBs using the framework of PU learning.</description>

      <title>A white dwarf binary showing sporadic radio pulses at the orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, and with periodicity of minutes to an hour [1-4]. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way, and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorised to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetised environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars [5-8]. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101+5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 minutes. We find that ILT J1101+5521 is an M dwarf - white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101+5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101+5521 is likely a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronised the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf [9]. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between the two stars may generate the sporadic radio emission. Such mechanisms have been previously theorised [10-13], but not observationally established.</description>

      <title>Powerful explosions from the collapse of rotating supermassive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform new general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for collapses of rotating supermassive star cores with an approximate nuclear burning up to carbon and a detailed equation of state. For all the models we investigate, the energy generation by nuclear burning plays only a minor role, leading to the formation of a black hole without a nuclear-powered explosion. For rotating models, however, the stellar explosion associated with shock heating is driven from a torus, which forms after the black hole formation. The explosion energy is up to $10^{-4}$ of the mass energy of the supermassive star cores ($\sim 10^{55}-10^{56}$ erg). We find that, even if we increase the rotational angular momentum of the progenitor, the ejecta mass saturates at $\sim 1$\% of the total mass of the initial stellar core. The average ejecta velocity also saturates at $\approx 20\%$ of the speed of light. As a result, the ejecta kinetic energy is approximately proportional to the initial mass of the supermassive star core for the rapidly rotating case. We also perform viscous hydrodynamics simulations for exploring the evolution of the remnant torus. Although the viscous heating drives an outflow from the torus, we find that its effect is subdominant in terms of the kinetic energy because of the small velocity ($\approx 0.07c$) of the ejecta component.</description>

      <title>Threshold mass of the general relativistic instability for supermassive star cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of the final fate of supermassive star (SMS) cores on their mass and angular momentum is studied with simple modeling. SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability during the stellar evolution if the mass is larger than $\sim 3 \times 10^4M_\odot$. Spherical SMS cores in the helium burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron-positron pair instability if the mass is larger than $\sim 1\times 10^4M_\odot$. For rapidly rotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a factor of $\sim 5$, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than $\sim 10^4M_\odot$ the collapse is triggered by the pair-instability, irrespective of the rotation. After the onset of the general relativistic instability, SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to collapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas the SMS cores in the helium burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no black hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.</description>

      <title>On gamma rays as predictors of UHECR flux in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the main candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sources. However, while theoretical and some phenomenological works favor AGNs as the main sources, recent works have shown that using the very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray flux as a proxy for the UHECR flux leads to a bad agreement with data. In this context, the energy spectrum and composition data are hardly fitted. At the same time, the arrival directions map is badly described and a spurious dipole direction is produced. In this work, we propose a possible solution to these contradictions. Using the observed $\gamma$-ray flux as a proxy may carry the implicit assumption of beamed UHECR emission and, consequently, its beam will remain collimated up to its detection on Earth. We show that assuming an isotropic UHECR emission and correcting the $\gamma$-ray emission proxy by Doppler boosting can overcome the problem. The combined fit of the spectrum and composition is improved by $3.56\sigma$, while the predicted arrival directions agree much better with the data. In particular, a spurious direction of the dipole can be reduced from $10.3 \ (5.4)\sigma$ away from the data to $2.2 \ (1.5)\sigma$ for $E &gt; 8$ EeV ($E &gt; 32$ EeV). We also show that this effect is particularly important when including AGNs of different classes in the same analysis, such as radio galaxies and blazars.</description>

      <title>Modeling multiband SEDs and light curves of BL Lacertae using a time-dependent shock-in-jet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of fast flux variability in blazars is a long-standing problem, with many theoretical models proposed to explain it. In this study, we focus on BL Lacertae to model its spectral energy distribution (SED) and broadband light curves using a diffusive shock acceleration process involving multiple mildly relativistic shocks, coupled with a time-dependent radiation transfer code. BL Lacertae was the target of a comprehensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign in early July 2021. We present a detailed investigation of the source's broadband spectral and light curve features using simultaneous observations at optical-UV frequencies with Swift-UVOT, in X-rays with Swift-XRT and AstroSat-SXT/LAXPC, and in gamma-rays with Fermi-LAT, covering the period from July to August 2021 (MJD 59400 to 59450). A fractional variability analysis shows that the source is most variable in gamma-rays, followed by X-rays, UV, and optical. This allowed us to determine the fastest variability time in gamma-rays to be on the order of a few hours. The AstroSat-SXT and LAXPC light curves indicate X-ray variability on the order of a few kiloseconds. Modeling simultaneously the SEDs of low and high flux states of the source and the multiband light curves provided insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms at play. This is the first instance of a physical model that accurately captures the multi-band temporal variability of BL Lacertae, including the hour-scale fluctuations observed during the flare.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>From 100 MHz to 10 GHz: Unveiling the spectral evolution of the X-shaped radio galaxy in Abell 3670</title>

Abstract: X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) are characterised by two pairs of misaligned lobes, namely the active lobes hosting radio jets and the wings. None of the formation mechanisms proposed so far can exhaustively reproduce the diverse features observed among XRGs. The emerging evidence is the existence of sub-populations of XRGs forming via different processes. The brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 3670 (A3670) is a dumbbell system hosting the XRG MRC 2011-298. The morphological and spectral properties of this interesting XRG have been first characterised through Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) data at 1-10 GHz. In the present work, we followed-up MRC 2011-298 with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 120-800 MHz to further constrain its properties and origin. We carried out a detailed spectral analysis sampling different spatial scales. Integrated radio spectra, spectral index maps, radio colour-colour diagrams, and radiative age maps of both the active lobes and prominent wings have been employed to test the origin of the source. We confirm a progressive spectral steepening from the lobes to the wings. The maximum radiative age of the source is $\sim 80$ Myr, with the wings being older than the lobes by $\gtrsim 30$ Myr in their outermost regions. The observed properties are in line with an abrupt reorientation of the jets by $\sim 90$ deg from the direction of the wings to their present position. This formation mechanism is further supported by the comparison with numerical simulations in the literature, which additionally highlight the role of hydrodynamic processes in the evolution of large wings such as those of MRC 2011-298. Potentially, the coalescence of supermassive black holes could have triggered the spin-flip of the jets. Moreover, we show that the S-shape of the radio jets is likely driven by precession with a period $P \sim 10$ Myr.</description>

      <title>Capture Rates of Highly Degenerate Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the low temperature and high density conditions of a neutron star crust neutrons are degenerate. In this work, we study the effect of this degeneracy on the capture rates of neutrons on neutron rich nuclei in accreted crusts. We use a statistical Hauser-Feshbach model to calculate neutron capture rates and find that neutron degeneracy can increase rates significantly. Changes increase from a factor of a few to many orders of magnitude near the neutron drip line. We also quantify uncertainties due to model inputs for masses, $\gamma$-strength functions, and level densities. We find that uncertainties increase dramatically away from stability and that degeneracy tends to increase these uncertainties further, except for cases near the neutron drip line where degeneracy leads to more robustness. As in the case of capture of classically distributed neutrons, variations in the mass model have the strongest impact. Corresponding variations in the reaction rates can be as high as 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, and be more than 5 times larger than under classical conditions. To ease the incorporation of neutron degeneracy in nucleosynthesis networks, we provide tabulated results of capture rates as well as analytical expressions as function of temperature and neutron chemical potential, for proton numbers between $3 \le Z \le 85$, derived from fits to our numerical results. Fits are based on a new parametrization that complements previously employed power law approximations with additional Lorentzian terms that account for low energy resonances, significantly improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a dynamic corona in the short-term time lags of black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070</title>

Abstract: In X-ray observations of hard state black hole X-ray binaries, rapid variations in accretion disc and coronal power-law emission are correlated and show Fourier-frequency-dependent time lags. On short (~0.1 s) time-scales, these lags are thought to be due to reverberation and therefore may depend strongly on the geometry of the corona. Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are variations in X-ray flux that have been suggested to arise because of geometric changes in the corona, possibly due to General Relativistic Lense-Thirring precession. Therefore one might expect the short-term time lags to vary on the QPO time-scale. We performed novel spectral-timing analyses on NICER observations of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during the hard state of its outburst in 2018 to investigate how the short-term time lags between a disc-dominated and a coronal power-law-dominated energy band vary on different time-scales. Our method can distinguish between variability due to the QPO and broadband noise, and we find a linear correlation between the power-law flux and lag amplitude that is strongest at the QPO frequency. We also introduce a new method to resolve the QPO signal and determine the QPO-phase-dependence of the flux and lag variations, finding that both are very similar. Our results are consistent with a geometric origin of QPOs, but also provide evidence for a dynamic corona with a geometry varying in a similar way over a broad range of time-scales, not just the QPO time-scale.</description>

      <title>AGN jet-inflated bubbles as possible origin of odd radio circles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We consider CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets as they tend to inflate oblate bubbles, promising to reproduce the large inferred sizes of the ORCs when viewed end-on. We find that powerful and long-duration CRp-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes ($\sim 300-600$ kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 8\times 10^{12} - 8\times 10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Supernova 1987A Shock Breakout</title>

Abstract: Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code with the opacity table, $\texttt{OPAL}$, considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\sim 4\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ then following a decay rate of $\sim 3.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hours after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\sim 1.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.</description>

Abstract: According to the hypothesis that strange quark matter may be the true ground state of matter at extremely high densities, strange quark stars should be stable and could exist in the Universe. It is possible that pulsars may actually be strange stars, but not neutron stars. Here we present a short review on recent progresses in the field of strange quark stars. First, three popular phenomenological models widely used to describe strange quark matter are introduced, with special attention being paid on the corresponding equation of state in each model. Combining the equation of state with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations, the inner structure and mass-radius relation can be obtained for the whole sequence of strange stars. Tidal deformability and oscillations (both radial and non-radial oscillations), which are sensitive to the composition and the equations of state, are then described. Hybrid stars as a special kind of quark stars are discussed. Several other interesting aspects of strange stars are also included. For example, strong gravitational wave emissions may be generated by strange stars through various mechanisms, which may help identify strange stars via observations. Especially, close-in strange quark planets with respect to their hosts may provide a unique test for the existence of strange quark objects. Fierce electromagnetic bursts could also be generated by strange stars. The energy may come from the phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars, or from the merger of binary strange stars. The collapse of the strange star crust can also release a huge amount of energy. It is shown that strange quark stars may be involved in short gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical evolution of the asteroid belt in a massive star-neutron star binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit repetitive behaviors and their origins remain enigmatic. It has been argued that repeating FRBs could be produced by the interaction between a neutron star and an asteroid belt. Here we consider the systems in which an asteroid belt dwells around a massive star, while a neutron star, as a companion of the massive star, interacts with the belt through gravitational force. Various orbital configurations are assumed for the system. Direct N-body simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of the asteroids belt. It is found that a larger orbital eccentricity of the neutron star will destroy the belt more quickly, with a large number of asteroids being scattered out of the system. A low inclination not only suppresses the collisions but also inhibits the ejection rate at early stages. However, highly inclined systems may undergo strong oscillations, resulting in the Kozai--Lidov instabilities. Among the various configurations, a clear periodicity is observed in the collision events for the case with an orbital eccentricity of 0.7 and mutual inclination of $0^{\circ}$. It is found that such a periodicity can be sustained for at least 8 neutron star orbital periods, supporting this mechanism as a possible explanation for periodically repeating FRBs. Our studies also suggest that the active stage of these kinds of FRB sources should be limited, since the asteroid belt would finally be destroyed by the neutron star after multiple passages.</description>

      <title>Superbubbles as Galactic PeVatrons: The Potential Role of Rapid Second-Order Fermi Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The origin of Galactic cosmic rays is still a mystery, in particular the sources and acceleration mechanism for cosmic rays with energies up to or beyond a PeV. Recently LHAASO has and H.E.S.S have shown that two gamma-ray sources associated with superbubbles created by young massive stellar clusters are likely PeVatrons. This has renewed the interest in the cosmic-ray acceleration processes in superbubbles. Aims: To study the possibility and conditions under which second-order Fermi acceleration can accelerate particles beyond PeV energies in superbubbles. Methods: An analytical equation is derived for the maximum energy a cosmic-ray particle can obtain as a function of acceleration duration and size. The maximum energy depends critically on the diffusion coefficient D and the Alfven velocity, V_A. The analytical solutions for the acceleration time scale shows that second-order Fermi acceleration can be just as efficient as diffusive shock acceleration, when comparable relevant velocities are used -- i.e. the Alfven velocity or shock velocity. Ultimately, the maximum energy is determined by the diffusive escape of the cosmic rays, which depends on the size and diffusion coefficient. This limits the maximum energy to a few PeV for superbubble radii of ~50 pc. The probable values for the diffusion coefficient and Alven speed are studied for two likely PeVatron regions, HESS J1646-458 associated with Westerlund 1, and the Cygnus Cocoon, associated Cyg OB2. Results: It is shown that within a typical stellar cluster time scale of 1-5 Myr cosmic rays can be accelerated to &gt; 10^15 eV, provided that V_A &gt;300 km/s, and the diffusion coefficient is D~10^26 cm^2s at 100 TeV. This suggests that second-order Fermi acceleration in superbubbles should be considered as a possible source of Galactic cosmic rays up to, or beyond a PeV.</description>

      <title>Cosmological simulations of the generation of cluster-scale radio emission from turbulent re-acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The recent discovery of so-called mega radio halos as a new class of diffuse, steep-spectrum radio sources in clusters of galaxies has raised questions about the origin and the evolution of cluster-wide radio emission. Aims. We investigate whether the formation mechanisms of radio halos and mega radio halos differ, or whether they can be produced by different modalities of the same (re)acceleration mechanism. Here we present results of a cosmological simulation of a disturbed galaxy cluster, with the aim to study the origin of mega radio halos. Methods. We analysed the evolution of cosmic-ray electrons, subject to gains and losses using a Fokker-Planck solver. In particular, we included the effects of Adiabatic Stochastic Acceleration (ASA) which is caused by the stochastic interaction of cosmic rays with diffusing magnetic field lines in super-Alfvenic turbulence. Moreover, we included shock acceleration and the seeding of cosmic-ray electrons by galaxies. Results. Our simulations generate cluster-scale radio sources during mergers, with properties that are in agreement with those observed for real radio halos. Furthermore, we find evidence of additional emission on larger scales. This emission resembles the radial distribution and the spectrum of a mega radio halo, but only when viewed close to the merger axis. Conclusions. In our simulation, the mechanism responsible for the formation of diffuse radio emission, both in the form of classical and mega radio halos, is cosmic-ray re-acceleration by turbulence. This turbulence is more solenoidal and more subsonic in the classical radio halo region, than in the mega radio halo region.</description>

      <title>Evidence for particle acceleration approaching PeV energies in the W51 complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex is widely acknowledged to be attributed to the interaction between the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the shock of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C and the dense molecular clouds in the adjacent star-forming region, W51B. However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of $\gamma$ rays emanating from the W51 complex, with energies from 2 TeV to 200 TeV. The LHAASO measurements, for the first time, extend the $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex beyond 100 TeV and reveal a significant spectrum bending at tens of TeV. By combining the ``$\pi^0$-decay bump" featured data from Fermi-LAT, the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the W51 region can be well-characterized by a simple pp-collision model. The observed spectral bending feature suggests an exponential cutoff at $\sim400$~TeV or a power-law break at $\sim200$~TeV in the CR proton spectrum, most likely providing the first evidence of SNRs serving as CR accelerators approaching the PeV regime. Additionally, two young star clusters within W51B could also be theoretically viable to produce the most energetic $\gamma$ rays observed by LHAASO. Our findings strongly support the presence of extreme CR accelerators within the W51 complex and provide new insights into the origin of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>On the flux density spectral property of high linearly polarized signal from Pulsar J0332+5434</title>

Abstract: The polarization position angles (PPA) of time samples with high linear polarization often show two parallel tracks across the pulsar profile that follow the rotating vector model (RVM). This feature support coherent curvature radiation (CCR) as the underlying mechanism of radio emission from pulsars, where the parallel tracks of the PPA represent the orthogonal extraordinary X and ordinary O eigen modes of strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, the frequency evolution of these high linearly polarized signals remains unexplored. In this work we explore the flux density spectral nature of high linearly polarized signals by studying the emission from PSR J0332+5434 over a frequency range between 300 MHz and 750 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulsar average profile comprises of a central core and a pair of conal components. We find the high linearly polarized time samples to be broadband in nature and in many cases they resemble a narrow spiky feature in the conal regions. These spiky features are localised within a narrow pulse longitude, over the entire frequency range, and their spectral shapes sometimes resemble an inverted parabolic shape. In all such cases the PPA are exclusively along one of the orthogonal RVM tracks, likely corresponding to the X-mode. The inverted spectral shape can in principle be explained if the high linearly polarized emission in these time samples are formed due to incoherent addition of CCR from a large number of charged solitons (charge bunches) exciting the X-mode.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the behavior of light ray trajectories in the exterior geometry of a rotating black hole within the Rastall theory of gravity, which is surrounded by an inhomogeneous anisotropic electronic cold plasma. By specifying the plasma's frequency profile, we derive fully analytical solutions for the temporal evolution of spacetime coordinates using elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions. These solutions illustrate various possible orbits. Throughout the study, we compare the results with those in the vacuum case, emphasizing the influence of plasma. Additionally, we utilize the analytical solutions to establish the lens equation for the considered spacetime. The investigation also addresses the significance of spherical photon orbits on critical trajectories, by presenting several examples.</description>

      <title>New search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>

      <title>Compression Acceleration of Protons and Heavier Ions at the Heliospheric Current Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multi-species ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach $E_{max} \sim 0.1$ - $1$ MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio $E_{max} \propto (Q/M)^\alpha$. When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasilinear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that $\alpha \sim 0.4$, which is somewhat smaller than $\alpha \sim 0.7$ observed by PSP.</description>
