      <title>Energy bounds for weighted spherical codes and designs via linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal bounds for the potential energy of weighted spherical codes are obtained by linear programming. The universality is in the sense of Cohn-Kumar -- every attaining code is optimal with respect to a large class of potential functions (absolutely monotone), in the sense of Levenshtein -- there is a bound for every weighted code, and in the sense of parameters (nodes and weights) -- they are independent of the potential function. We derive a necessary condition for optimality (in the linear programming framework) of our lower bounds which is also shown to be sufficient when the potential is strictly absolutely monotone. Bounds are also obtained for the weighted energy of weighted spherical designs. We explore our bounds for several previously studied weighted spherical codes.</description>

      <title>Signed graphs in data sciences via communicability geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed graphs are an emergent way of representing data in a variety of contexts were conflicting interactions exist. These include data from biological, ecological, and social systems. Here we propose the concept of communicability geometry for signed graphs, proving that metrics in this space, such as the communicability distance and angles, are Euclidean and spherical. We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in data analysis of signed graphs in a unified way. They include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks as well as the quantification of the degree of polarization between the existing factions in systems represented by this type of graphs.</description>

      <title>Variational structures for the Fokker--Planck equation with general Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove convergence of a modified Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto scheme to a solution to the Fokker--Planck equation in $\Omega \Subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with spatially nonconstant Dirichlet boundary conditions. We work under mild assumptions on the domain, on the drift, and on the initial datum. In the special case where $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we prove that such a solution is a gradient flow -- curve of maximal slope -- within a suitable space of measures, endowed with a modified Wasserstein distance. Our discrete scheme and modified distance draw inspiration from contributions by A. Figalli and N. Gigli [J. Math. Pures Appl. 94, (2010), pp. 107--130], and J. Morales [J. Math. Pures Appl. 112, (2018), pp. 41--88] on an optimal-transport approach to evolution equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Volumes of subset Minkowski sums and the Lyusternik region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin a systematic study of the region of possible values of the volumes of Minkowski subset sums of a collection of $M$ compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we call the Lyusternik region, and make some first steps towards describing it. Our main result is that a fractional generalization of the Brunn-Minkowski-Lyusternik inequality conjectured by Bobkov et al. (2011) holds in dimension 1. Even though Fradelizi et al. (2016) showed that it fails in general dimension, we show that a variant does hold in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>
