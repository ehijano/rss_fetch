      <title>Learning Topological Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two geometric spaces are in the same topological class if they are related by certain geometric deformations. We propose machine learning methods that automate learning of topological invariance and apply it in the context of knot theory, where two knots are equivalent if they are related by ambient space isotopy. Specifically, given only the knot and no information about its topological invariants, we employ contrastive and generative machine learning techniques to map different representatives of the same knot class to the same point in an embedding vector space. An auto-regressive decoder Transformer network can then generate new representatives from the same knot class. We also describe a student-teacher setup that we use to interpret which known knot invariants are learned by the neural networks to compute the embeddings, and observe a strong correlation with the Goeritz matrix in all setups that we tested. We also develop an approach to resolving the Jones Unknot Conjecture by exploring the vicinity of the embedding space of the Jones polynomial near the locus where the unknots cluster, which we use to generate braid words with simple Jones polynomials.</description>

      <title>Conformal dimension bounds for certain Coxeter group Bowditch boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give upper and lower bounds on the conformal dimension of the Bowditch boundary of a Coxeter group with defining graph a complete graph and edge labels at least three. The lower bounds are obtained by quasi-isometrically embedding Gromov's round trees in the Davis complex. The upper bounds are given by exhibiting a geometrically finite action on a CAT(-1) space and bounding the Hausdorff dimension of the visual boundary of this space. Our results imply that there are infinitely many quasi-isometry classes within each infinite family of such Coxeter groups with edge labels bounded from above. As an application, we prove there are infinitely many quasi-isometry classes among the family of hyperbolic groups with Pontryagin sphere boundary. Combining our results with work of Bourdon--Kleiner proves the conformal dimension of the boundaries of hyperbolic groups in this family achieves a dense set in $(1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Topologically Directed Simulations Reveal the Impact of Geometric Constraints on Knotted Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Legendrian racks: Classification, tensors, and knot coloring invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves. We study algebraic aspects of GL-racks and coloring invariants of Legendrian links.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles and the categorical center of GL-racks.
  Then we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.
  Answering another open question, we use GL-racks to distinguish Legendrian knots whose classical invariants are identical. In particular, we complete the classification of Legendrian $8_{13}$ knots.
  Finally, we use exhaustive search algorithms to classify GL-racks up to order 8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold is called a geodesic orbit manifolds, GO for short, if any geodesic is an orbit of a one-parameter group of isometries. By a result of C.Gordon, a non-flat GO nilmanifold is necessarily a two-step nilpotent Lie group with a left-invariant metric. We give a complete classification of non-singular GO nilmanifolds. Besides previously known examples, there are new families with 3-dimensional center, and two one-parameter families of dimensions 14 and 15.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tight versus overtwisted dichotomy has been an essential organizing principle and driving force in 3-dimensional contact geometry since its inception around 1990. In this article, we will discuss the genesis of this dichotomy in Eliashberg's seminal work and his influential contributions to the theory.</description>

      <title>Teichm\"uller spaces, polynomial loci, and degeneration in spaces of algebraic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analog of the notion of a character variety in the context of algebraic correspondences. It turns out that matings of certain Fuchsian groups and polynomials are contained in this ambient character variety. This gives rise to two different analogs of the Bers slice by fixing either the polynomial or the Fuchsian group. The Bers-like slices are homeomorphic copies of Teichm\"uller spaces or combinatorial copies of polynomial connectedness loci. We show that these slices are bounded in the character variety, thus proving the analog of a theorem of Bers. To produce compactifications of the Bers-like slices, we initiate a study of degeneration of algebraic correspondences on trees of Riemann spheres, revealing a new degeneration phenomenon in conformal dynamics. There is no available analog of Sullivan's 'no invariant line field' theorem in our context. Nevertheless, for the four times punctured sphere, we show that the compactifications of Teichm\"uller spaces are naturally homeomorphic.</description>

      <title>On finite type invariants of welded string links and ribbon tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Welded knotted objects are a combinatorial extension of knot theory, which can be used as a tool for studying ribbon surfaces in $4$-space. A finite type invariant theory for ribbon knotted surfaces was developped by Kanenobu, Habiro and Shima, and this paper proposes a study of these invariants, using welded objects. Specifically, we study welded string links up to $w_k$-equivalence, which is an equivalence relation introduced by Yasuhara and the second author in connection with finite type theory. In low degrees, we show that this relation characterizes the information contained by finite type invariants. We also study the algebraic structure of welded string links up to $w_k$-equivalence. All results have direct corollaries for ribbon knotted surfaces.</description>

      <title>Five tori in $S^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ivansic proved that there is a link $L$ of five tori in $S^4$ with hyperbolic complement. We describe $L$ explicitly with pictures, study its properties, and discover that $L$ is in many aspects similar to the Borromean rings in $S^3$. In particular the following hold: (1) Any two tori in $L$ are unlinked, but three are not; (2) The complement $M = S^4 \setminus L$ is integral arithmetic hyperbolic; (3) The symmetry group of $L$ acts $k$-transitively on its components for all $k$; (4) The double branched covering over $L$ has geometry $\mathbb H^2 \times \mathbb H^2$; (5) The fundamental group of $M$ has a nice presentation via commutators; (6) The Alexander ideal has an explicit simple description; (7) Every class $x \in H^1(M,Z) = Z^5$ with non-zero xi is represented by a perfect circle-valued Morse function; (8) By longitudinal Dehn surgery along $L$ we get a closed 4-manifold with fundamental group $Z^5$; (9) The link $L$ can be put in perfect position. This leads also to the first descriptions of a cusped hyperbolic 4-manifold as a complement of tori in $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and as a complement of some explicit Lagrangian tori in the product of two surfaces of genus two.</description>
