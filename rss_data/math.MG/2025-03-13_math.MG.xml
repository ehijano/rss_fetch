      <title>Quasigeodesics on the Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasigeodesic is a curve on the surface of a convex polyhedron that has $\le \pi$ surface to each side at every point. In contrast, a geodesic has exactly $\pi$ to each side and so can never pass through a vertex, whereas quasigeodesics can. Although it is known that every convex polyhedron has at least three simple closed quasigeodesics, little else is known. Only tetrahedra have been thoroughly studied.
  In this paper we explore the quasigeodesics on a cube, which have not been previously enumerated. We prove that the cube has exactly $15$ simple closed quasigeodesics (beyond the three known simple closed geodesics). For the lower bound we detail $15$ simple closed quasigeodesics. Our main contribution is establishing a matching upper bound. For general convex polyhedra, there is no known upper bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a family of $5$-dimensional prismatoids whose width grows linearly in the number of vertices. This provides a new infinite family of counter-examples to the Hirsch conjecture whose excess width grows linearly in the number of vertices, and answers a question of Matschke, Santos and Weibel.</description>

      <title>Elementary fractal geometry. 6. The dynamical interior of self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the one hand, the dynamical interior of a self-similar set with open set condition is the complement of the dynamical boundary. On the other hand, the dynamical interior is the recurrent set of the magnification flow. For a finite type self-similar set, both boundary and interior are described by finite automata. The neighbor graph defines the boundary. The neighborhood graph, based on work by Thurston, Lalley, Ngai and Wang, defines the interior. If local views are considered up to similarity, the interior obtains a discrete manifold structure, and the magnification flow is discretized by a Markov chain. This leads to new methods for the visualization and description of finite type attractors.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Banach spaces I -- Directed completion of partial orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is to advertise the concept of directed completion of partial orders as the natural analogue of Cauchy-completion in Lorentzian signature, especially in relation to non-smooth and/or infinite dimensional geometries.
  A closely related notion appeared in the recent [2] where it was used as ground for further development of non-smooth calculus in metric spacetimes allowing, for instance, for a quite general limit curve theorem in such setting. The proposal in [2] was also in part motivated by the discussion we make here, key points being:
  - A general existence result, already obtained in the context of theoretical computer science and for which we give a slightly different presentation.
  - An example showing that an analogue two-sided completion is unsuitable from the (or at least `some') geometric/analytic perspective.
  - The existence of natural links with both the the concept of ideal point of Geroch--Kronheimer--Penrose and with Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem, showing in particular an underlying commonality between these two seemingly far concepts.
  - The flexibility of the notion, that by nature can cover non-smooth and infinite-dimensional situations.
  - The fact that the concept emerges spontaneously when investigating the duality relations between $L^p$ and $L^q$ spaces where $\tfrac1p+\tfrac 1q = 1$ are H\"older conjugate exponents with $p, q &lt; 1$.
  This note is part of a larger work in progress that aims at laying the grounds of a Lorentzian, or Hyperbolic, theory of Banach spaces. Given that the notion of completion has nothing to do with the linear structure and the growing interest around this topic, for instance related to convergence of geometric structures, we make available these partial findings.</description>

      <title>Each generic polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has a point with ten normals to the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured since long that each smooth convex body $\mathbf{P}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has a point in its interior which belongs to at least $2n$ normals from different points on the boundary of $\mathbf{P}$. The conjecture is proven for $n=2,3,4$. We treat the same problem for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and prove that each generic polytope has a point in its interior with $10$ normals to the boundary. This bound is exact: there exists a tetrahedron with no more than $10$ normals emanating from a point in its interior.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces and their boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between negatively curved spaces and their boundaries is important for various rigidity problems. In \cite{biswas2024quasi}, the class of Gromov hyperbolic spaces called maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces was introduced, and the boundary functor $X \mapsto \partial X$ was shown to give an equivalence of categories between maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces (with morphisms being isometries) and a class of compact quasi-metric spaces called quasi-metric antipodal spaces (with morphisms being Moebius homeomorphisms). The proof of this equivalence involved the construction of a filling functor $Z \mapsto {\mathcal M}(Z)$, associating to any quasi-metric antipodal space $Z$ a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space ${\mathcal M}(Z)$.
  We study the ``continuity" properties of the boundary and filling functors. We show that convergence of a sequence of quasi-metric antipodal spaces (in a certain sense called ``almost-isometric convergence") implies convergence (in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense) of the associated maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Conversely, we show that convergence of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces together with a natural hypothesis of ``equicontinuity" on the boundaries implies convergence of boundaries. We use this to show that Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of a sequence of proper, geodesically complete CAT(-1) spaces implies Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of their boundaries equipped with visual metrics. We also show that convergence of maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces to a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space with finite boundary implies convergence of boundaries.</description>

      <title>A note on Erd\H{o}s matrices and Marcus$\unicode{x2013}$Ree inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that any bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\Delta_n(A):= \max_{\sigma\in S_n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A(i, \sigma(i))-\sum_{i, j=1}^n A(i, j)^2 \geq 0$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_n(A)=0$. It was recently proved that there are only finitely many such matrices for any $n$. However, a complete list of such matrices was obtained in dimension $n=2, 3$ only recently, arXiv:2306.05518. In this paper, we characterize all $4\times 4$ bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_4(A)=0$. Furthermore, we show that for $n\geq 3$, $\Delta_n(A)=\alpha$ has uncountably many solutions when $\alpha\notin \{0, (n-1)/4\}$. This answers a question raised in arXiv:2410.06612. We extend the Marcus$\unicode{x2013}$Ree inequality to infinite bistochastic arrays and bistochastic kernels. Our investigation into $4\times 4$ Erd\H{o}s matrices also raises several intriguing questions that are of independent interest. We propose several questions and conjectures and present numerical evidence for them.</description>

      <title>Spread Furstenberg Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds for (a variant of) the Furstenberg set problem for high dimensional flats over $\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, let $F\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $1\leq k \leq n-1$, $s\in (0,k]$, and $t\in (0,k(n-k)]$. We say that $F$ is a $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set if there exists a $t$-dimensional set of subspaces $\mathcal P \subset \mathcal G(n,k)$ such that for all $P\in \mathcal P$, there exists a translation vector $a_P \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\dim(F\cap (P + a_P)) \geq s$. We show that given $k \geq k_0 +1$ (where $k_0:= k_0(n)$ is sufficiently large) and $s&gt;k_0$, every $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set $F$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies \[ \dim F \geq n-k + s - \frac{k(n-k) - t}{\lceil s\rceil - k_0 +1 }. \] Our methodology is motivated by the work of the second author, Dvir, and Lund over finite fields.</description>
