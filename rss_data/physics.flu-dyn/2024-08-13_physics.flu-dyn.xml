      <title>Flame Modelling of Premixed Ammonia Combustion in Swirl Burner using LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the LES simulation is to investigate how operational parameters affect flame properties in combustion of the premixed NH3/H2/air inside a swirling burner. Key parameters explored include the differential blend ratio of NH3/H2 fuels, ignition conditions, flow dynamics, and the balance between accuracy and computational cost using reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms. The numerical simulation findings suggest optimal operational conditions for enhancing thermal efficiency and controlling NOx emissions for experimental setups, scaling up combustion platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Tidally-Forced Internal Wave Turbulence at High Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through basin-scale circulations, the ocean regulates global distributions of heat, nutrients, and greenhouse gases. To properly predict the future of the ocean under climate change, we need to develop a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive global circulations. An estimated 2 TW of power is required to support interior mixing. Roughly half of this power is believed to come from tidal flow over topography, producing internal gravity waves (IGW's), which can radiate energy throughout the ocean interior. But it is difficult to track the subsequent journey from tidal injection to dissipation, as the energy cascade spans an enormous range of spatio-temporal scales and multiple different nonlinear transfer mechanisms. To investigate the full energy pathway from topographic forcing to irreversible mixing, we built a model ocean in a large-scale laboratory wavetank (9 m x 2.9 m x 0.75 m) allowing Reynolds numbers up to O(10$^5$). We replicate the tidal forcing by oscillating an idealized ocean ridge. We track energy transfer across the first cascade, driven by wave turbulence, using Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) over the full tank. Through the BOS we observe the formation of various sets of subharmonics, driven by Triadic Resonant Instabilities (TRI). At later times, the subharmonics born from TRI engage in different interactions, which ultimately develop a continuum of waves at frequencies up to $N$. We validate the three-wave resonant conditions through a Fourier decomposition and confirm a backward cascade in frequency but a forward cascade in vertical wavenumber. Through our spatial analysis, we identify relevant three-wave interactions and show the significance of elastic scattering, a nonlocal interaction, in our fully evolved system. We note however that the majority of our triads are local, which have been historically overlooked.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hysteresis of an oscillatory contact line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During oscillatory wetting, a phase retardation emerges between contact angle variation and contact line velocity, presenting as a hysteresis loop in their correlation -- an effect we term dynamic hysteresis. This phenomenon is found to be tunable by modifying the surface with different molecular layers. A comparative analysis of dynamic hysteresis, static hysteresis, and contact line friction coefficients across diverse substrates reveals that dynamic hysteresis is not a result of dissipative effects but is instead proportionally linked to the flexibility of the grafted layer on the surface. In the quest for appropriate conditions to model oscillatory contact line motion, we identify the generalized Hocking's linear law and modified Generalized Navier Boundary Condition (GNBC) as alternative options for predicting realistic dynamic hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Developing the next generation of dual-tip phase-detection probes for air-water flow experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-aerated is a fascinating phenomenon that commonly occurs in high Froude-number flows in natural or human made environments. The most common air-water flow measurement instrument to characterize such flows is the intrusive dual-tip phase-detection needle probe, which identifies phase changes around the needle tips due to a change of resistivity (phase-detection conductivity probe) or light refraction (phase-detection fiber optical probe). Phase-detection conductivity probes are typically custom made for research purposes, with current design dating back to the 1980ies. In the present study, the next generation of dual-tip conductivity probes is developed and validated against a state-of-the-art system. The novel probe design comprises two main features, including (1) a printed circuit board of the sensor's electrodes and (2) a detachable sensor head. These features offer many advantages over the classical needle-type design. For example, the circuit boards can be manufactured with high precision and the sensor head can be easily replaced in case of damage or deterioration. As such, it is anticipated that this relatively cheap and robust design will enable a better repeatability of air-water flow experiments, combined with an enhanced accessibility for the air-water flow research community.</description>

      <title>Droplets in Acoustic Fields: A Unified Theory from Migration to Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework governing the dynamics of droplets in acoustic fields, applicable to all droplet sizes, from the Rayleigh limit (D&lt;&lt;lambda) and beyond. Our theory elucidates the nature of acoustic forces and incorporates the effects of interfacial tension, enabling predictions of droplet migration, deformation, and splitting under suitable conditions. Importantly, we demonstrate droplet deformation and splitting through bulk acoustic wave (BAW) silicon-glass microscale experiments, which validate the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of de-icing by surface Rayleigh and plate Lamb acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic waves (AW) have recently emerged as an energy-efficient ice removal procedure compatible with functional and industrial-relevant substrates. However, critical aspects at fundamental and experimental levels have yet to be disclosed to optimize their operational conditions. Identifying the processes and mechanisms by which different types of AWs induce de-icing are some of these issues. Herein, using model LiNbO3 systems and two types of interdigitated transducers, we analyze the de-icing and anti-icing efficiencies and mechanisms driven by Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (R-SAW) and Lamb waves with 120 and 510 um wavelengths, respectively. Through the experimental analysis of de-icing and active anti-icing processes and the finite element simulation of the AW generation, propagation, and interaction with small ice aggregates, we disclose that Lamb waves are more favorable than R-SAWs to induce de-icing and/or prevent the freezing of droplets. Prospects for applications of this study are supported by proof of concept experiments, including de-icing in an ice wind tunnel, demonstrating that Lamb waves can efficiently remove ice layers covering large LN substrates. Results indicate that the de-icing mechanism may differ for Lamb waves or R-SAWs and that the wavelength must be considered as an important parameter for controlling the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Kinetic representation of the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle method and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is a hybrid method for multiscale flow simulations, in which the contributions to the whole gas evolution from deterministic hydrodynamic wave and stochastic particle transport are combined simultaneously. Originally, the UGKWP method was developed as a direct modeling approach at discrete level. In this work, we revisit the time evolution of each part of the involved simulation particles and wave molecules in UGKWP, and present the corresponding kinetic equations. The resultant kinetic system can be viewed as a collision decomposition of the original kinetic equation, which can serve as a basis for developing other kinetic methods for flows in all flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Generalization capabilities of MeshGraphNets to unseen geometries for fluid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This works investigates the generalization capabilities of MeshGraphNets (MGN) [Pfaff et al. Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks. ICML 2021] to unseen geometries for fluid dynamics, e.g. predicting the flow around a new obstacle that was not part of the training data. For this purpose, we create a new benchmark dataset for data-driven computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which extends DeepMind's flow around a cylinder dataset by including different shapes and multiple objects. We then use this new dataset to extend the generalization experiments conducted by DeepMind on MGNs by testing how well an MGN can generalize to different shapes. In our numerical tests, we show that MGNs can sometimes generalize well to various shapes by training on a dataset of one obstacle shape and testing on a dataset of another obstacle shape.</description>

      <title>Modelling wildfire spread and spotfire merger using conformal mapping and AAA-least squares methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional model of wildfire spread and merger is presented. Three features affect the fire propagation: (i) a constant basic rate of spread term accounting for radiative and convective heat transfer, (ii) the unidirectional, constant ambient wind, and (iii) a fire-induced pyrogenic wind. Two numerical methods are proposed to solve for the harmonic pyrogenic potential. The first utilizes the conformal invariance of the Laplace equation, reducing the wildfire system to a single Polubarinova-Galin type equation. The second method uses a AAA-least squares method to find a rational approximation of the potential. Various wildfire scenarios are presented and the effects of the pyrogenic wind and the radiative/convective basic rate of spread terms investigated. Firebreaks such as roads and lakes are also included and solutions are found to match well with existing numerical and experimental results. The methods proposed in this work are suitably fast and accurate to be considered for operational use.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, using energy transfers, we demonstrate a route to thermalization in an isolated ensemble of realistic gas particles. We performed a grid-free classical molecular dynamics simulation of two-dimensional Lenard-Jones gas. We start our simulation with a large-scale vortex akin to a hydrodynamic flow and study its non-equilibrium behavior till it attains thermal equilibrium. In the intermediate phases, small wavenumbers ($k$) exhibit $E(k) \propto k^{-3}$ kinetic energy spectrum whereas large wavenumbers exhibit $E(k) \propto k$ spectrum. Asymptotically, $E(k) \propto k$ for the whole range of $k$, thus indicating thermalization. These results are akin to those of Euler turbulence despite complex collisions and interactions among the particles.</description>

      <title>Undulatory swimming in suspensions and networks of flexible filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological fluids are composed of suspended polymers immersed in a viscous fluid. A prime example is mucus, where the polymers are also known to form a network. While the presence of this microstructure is linked with an overall non-Newtonian response of the fluid, swimming cells and microorganisms similar in size to the network pores and polymer filaments instead experience the heterogeneous nature of the environment, interacting directly with the polymers as obstacles as they swim. To characterise and understand locomotion in these heterogeneous environments, we simulate the motion of an undulatory swimmer through 3D suspensions and networks of elastic filaments, exploring the effects of filament and link compliance and filament concentration up to 20\% volume fraction. For compliant environments, the swimming speed increases with filament concentration to values about 10\% higher than in a viscous fluid. In stiffer environments, a non-monotonic dependence is observed, with an initial increase in speed to values 5\% greater than in a viscous fluid, followed by a dramatic reduction to speeds just a fraction of its value in a viscous fluid. Velocity fluctuations are also more pronounced in stiffer environments. We demonstrate that speed enhancements are linked to hydrodynamic interactions with the microstructure, while reductions are due to the filaments restricting the amplitude of the swimmer's propulsive wave. Unlike previous studies where interactions with obstacles allowed for significant enhancements in swimming speeds, the modest enhancements seen here are more comparable to those given by models where the environment is treated as a continuous viscoelastic fluid.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Oberbeck--Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh--B\'{e}nard convection in forms of two-dimensional (2D) rolls. The thermal expansivity increases with pressure (depth), and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor $\epsilon$. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An $\epsilon^2$-order NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming bottom-heavy profiles. At $\epsilon^3$-order, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The values of Taylor number and Prandlt number determine whether upward or downward plumes are stronger. Numerical calculations validate the theoretical analyses in weakly nonlinear regime. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in some winter lakes on Earth, and in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.</description>

      <title>Considerations on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian hyperbolic model for heat transfer derived via Hamilton's principle: analytical and numerical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new model for heat transfer in compressible fluid flows. The model is derived from Hamilton's principle of stationary action in Eulerian coordinates, in a setting where the entropy conservation is recovered as an Euler--Lagrange equation. The governing system is shown to be hyperbolic. It is asymptotically consistent with the Euler equations for compressible heat conducting fluids, provided the addition of suitable relaxation terms. A study of the Rankine--Hugoniot conditions and the Clausius--Duhem inequality reveals that contact discontinuities cannot exist while expansion waves and compression fans are possible solutions to the governing equations. Evidence of these properties is provided on a set of numerical test cases.</description>

      <title>Interacting internal waves explain global patterns of interior ocean mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across the stable density stratification of the abyssal ocean, deep dense water is slowly propelled upward by sustained, though irregular, turbulent mixing. The resulting mean upwelling determines large-scale oceanic circulation properties like heat and carbon transport. In the ocean interior, this turbulent mixing is caused mainly by breaking internal waves: generated predominantly by winds and tides, these waves interact nonlinearly, transferring energy downscale, and finally become unstable, break and mix the water column. This paradigm, long parameterized heuristically, still lacks full theoretical explanation. Here, we close this gap using wave-wave interaction theory with input from both localized and global observations. We find near-ubiquitous agreement between first-principle predictions and observed mixing patterns in the global ocean interior. Our findings lay the foundations for a wave-driven mixing parameterization for ocean general circulation models that is entirely physics-based, which is key to reliably represent future climate states that could differ substantially from today's.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates how the adjoint-based framework traditionally used to compute gradients in PDE optimization problems can be extended to handle general constraints on the state variables. This is accomplished by constructing a projection of the gradient of the objective functional onto a subspace tangent to the manifold defined by the constraint. This projection is realized by solving an adjoint problem defined in terms of the same adjoint operator as used in the system employed to determine the gradient, but with a different forcing. We focus on the "optimize-then-discretize" paradigm in the infinite-dimensional setting where the required regularity of both the gradient and of the projection is ensured. The proposed approach is illustrated with two examples: a simple test problem describing optimization of heat transfer in one direction and a more involved problem where an optimal closure is found for a turbulent flow described by the Navier-Stokes system in two dimensions, both considered subject to different state constraints. The accuracy of the gradients and projections computed by solving suitable adjoint systems is carefully verified and the presented computational results show that the solutions of the optimization problems obtained with the proposed approach satisfy the state constraints with a good accuracy, although not exactly.</description>
