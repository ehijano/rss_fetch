      <title>Machine Learning for Improved Current Density Reconstruction from 2D Vector Magnetic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of electrical current densities from magnetic field measurements is an important technique with applications in materials science, circuit design, quality control, plasma physics, and biology. Analytic reconstruction methods exist for planar currents, but break down in the presence of high spatial frequency noise or large standoff distance, restricting the types of systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate the use of a deep convolutional neural network for current density reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images of vector magnetic fields acquired by a quantum diamond microscope (QDM). Trained network performance significantly exceeds analytic reconstruction for data with high noise or large standoff distances. This machine learning technique can perform quality inversions on lower SNR data, reducing the data collection time by a factor of about 400 and permitting reconstructions of weaker and three-dimensional current sources.</description>

      <title>ELEQTRONeX: A GPU-Accelerated Exascale Framework for Non-Equilibrium Quantum Transport in Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium electronic quantum transport is crucial for the operation of existing and envisioned electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices. The ultimate goal of encompassing atomistic to mesoscopic length scales in the same nonequilibrium device simulation approach has traditionally been challenging due to the computational cost of high-fidelity coupled multiphysics and multiscale requirements. In this work, we present ELEQTRONeX (ELEctrostatic Quantum TRansport modeling Of Nanomaterials at eXascale), a massively-parallel GPU-accelerated framework for self-consistently solving the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and electrostatics in complex device geometries. By customizing algorithms for GPU multithreading, we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in computational time, and excellent scaling on up to 512 GPUs and billions of spatial grid cells. We validate our code by computing band structures, current-voltage characteristics, conductance, and drain-induced barrier lowering for various 3D configurations of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors. We also demonstrate that ELEQTRONeX is suitable for complex device/material geometries where periodic approaches are not feasible, such as modeling of arrays of misaligned carbon nanotubes requiring fully 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>Shock Hugoniot calculations using on-the-fly machine learned force fields with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for computing the shock Hugoniot using on-the-fly machine learned force field (MLFF) molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we employ an MLFF model based on the kernel method and Bayesian linear regression to compute the electronic free energy, atomic forces, and pressure; in conjunction with a linear regression model between the electronic internal and free energies to compute the internal energy, with all training data generated from Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). We verify the accuracy of the formalism by comparing the Hugoniot for carbon with recent Kohn-Sham DFT results in the literature. In so doing, we demonstrate that Kohn-Sham calculations for the Hugoniot can be accelerated by up to two orders of magnitude, while retaining ab initio accuracy. We apply this framework to calculate the Hugoniots of 14 materials in the FPEOS database, comprising 9 single elements and 5 compounds, between temperatures of 10 kK and 2 MK. We find good agreement with first principles results in the literature while providing tighter error bars. In addition, we confirm that the inter-element interaction in compounds decreases with temperature.</description>

      <title>$B_c, B^{*}_c, B_s, B^{*}_s, D_s$ and $D^{*}_s$ mass shift in a nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light quark mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in-between of them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in-between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Born Oppenheimer Approximation for Molecules and Materials via Electric Field Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio method for computing vibro-polariton and phonon-polariton spectra of molecules and solids coupled to the photon modes of optical cavities. We demonstrate that if interactions of cavity photon modes with both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated on the level of the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA), spectra can be expressed in terms of the matter response to electric fields and nuclear displacements which are readily available in standard density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) implementations. In this framework, results over a range of cavity parameters can be obtained without the need for additional electronic structure calculations, enabling efficient calculations on a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, this approach enables results to be more readily interpreted in terms of the more familiar cavity-independent molecular electric field response properties, such as polarizability and Born effective charges which enter into the vibro-polariton calculation. Using corresponding electric field response properties of bulk insulating systems, we are also able to obtain $\Gamma$ point phonon-polariton spectra of two dimensional (2D) insulators. Results for a selection of cavity-coupled molecular and 2D crystal systems are presented to demonstrate the method.</description>

      <title>The Role of Helical and Non-Helical Drives on the evolution of Self-Consistent Dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the self-consistent dynamo limit, the magnetic feedback on the velocity field is sufficiently strong to induce a change in the topology of the magnetic field. Consequently, the magnetic energy reaches a state of non-linear saturation. Here, we investigate the role played by helical and non-helical drives in the triggering and the eventual saturation of a self-consistent dynamo. Evidence of small-scale dynamo (SSD) activity is found for both helical and non-helical forcing, driven at the largest possible scale. Based on the spectrum analysis, we find that the evolution of kinetic energy follows Kolmogorov's $k^-{\frac{5}{3}}$ law while that of magnetic energy follows Kazantsev's $k^{\frac{3}{2}}$ scaling. Also, we have verified that the aforementioned scalings remain valid for various magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm). Statistical analysis is found to support our numerical finds.</description>

      <title>Small Signal Capacitance in Ferroelectric HZO: Mechanisms and Physical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of the physical mechanisms governing small signal capacitance in ferroelectrics, focusing on Hafnium Zirconium Oxide. Utilizing a time-dependent Ginzburg Landau formalism-based 2D multi-grain phase-field simulation framework, we simulate the capacitance of metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors. Our simulation methodology closely mirrors the experimental procedures for measuring ferroelectric small signal capacitance, and the outcomes replicate the characteristic butterfly capacitance-voltage behavior. We delve into the components of the ferroelectric capacitance associated with the dielectric response and polarization switching, discussing the primary physical mechanisms - domain bulk response and domain wall response - contributing to the butterfly characteristics. We explore their interplay and relative contributions to the capacitance and correlate them to the polarization domain characteristics. Additionally, we investigate the impact of increasing domain density with ferroelectric thickness scaling, demonstrating an enhancement in the polarization capacitance component (in addition to the dielectric component). We further analyze the relative contributions of the domain bulk and domain wall responses across different ferroelectric thicknesses. Lastly, we establish the relation of polarization capacitance components to the capacitive memory window (for memory applications) and reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the maximum memory window on HZO thickness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing has been shown to be a useful framework for predicting critical transitions of a dynamical system if the bifurcation parameter is also provided as an input. Its utility is significant because in real-world scenarios, the exact model equations are unknown. This Letter shows how the theory of dynamical system provides the underlying mechanism behind the prediction. Using numerical methods, by considering dynamical systems which show Hopf bifurcation, we demonstrate that the map produced by the reservoir after a successful training undergoes a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation such that the critical point of the map is in immediate proximity to that of the original dynamical system. In addition, we have compared and analyzed different structures in the phase space. Our findings provide insight into the functioning of machine learning algorithms for predicting critical transitions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning CT Image Restoration using System Blur and Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The restoration of images affected by blur and noise has been widely studied and has broad potential for applications including in medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT). Although the blur and noise in CT images can be attributed to a variety of system factors, these image properties can often be modeled and predicted accurately and used in classical restoration approaches for deconvolution and denoising. In classical approaches, simultaneous deconvolution and denoising can be challenging and often represent competing goals. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to enhance image quality beyond classic limits; however, most deep learning models attempt a blind restoration problem and base their restoration on image inputs alone without direct knowledge of the image noise and blur properties. In this work, we present a method that leverages both degraded image inputs and a characterization of the system blur and noise to combine modeling and deep learning approaches. Different methods to integrate these auxiliary inputs are presented. Namely, an input-variant and a weight-variant approach wherein the auxiliary inputs are incorporated as a parameter vector before and after the convolutional block, respectively, allowing easy integration into any CNN architecture. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to baseline models lacking auxiliary inputs. Evaluations are based on the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), selected examples of good and poor performance for varying approaches, and an input space analysis to assess the effect of different noise and blur on performance. Results demonstrate the efficacy of providing a deep learning model with auxiliary inputs, representing system blur and noise characteristics, to enhance the performance of the model in image restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Efficient Switching of Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the scientific importance and broad application prospects of two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics, which prevalently exhibit vertical polarization with suitable stackings. It is crucial to understand the mechanisms of sliding ferroelectricity and to deterministically and efficiently switch the polarization with optimized electric fields. Here, applying our newly developed DREAM-Allegro multi-task equivariant neural network, which simultaneously predicts interatomic potentials and Born effective charges, we construct a comprehensive potential for boron nitride ($\mathrm{BN}$) bilayer. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal a remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 1500K, facilitated by robust intralayer chemical bonds and delicate interlayer van der Waals(vdW) interactions. More importantly, it is found that, compared to the out-of-plane electric field, the inclined field not only leads to deterministic switching of electric polarization, but also largely lower the critical strength of field, due to the presence of the in-plane polarization in the transition state. This strategy of an inclined field is demonstrated to be universal for other sliding ferroelectric systems with monolayer structures belonging to the symmetry group $p \bar{6} m 2$, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).</description>

      <title>First-principles study of structural and electronic properties of multiferroic oxide Mn3TeO6 under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mn3TeO6 (MTO) has been experimentally found to adopt a P21/n structure under high pressure, which exhibits a significantly smaller band gap compared to the atmospheric R-3 phase. In this study, we systematically investigate the magnetism, structural phase transition and electronic properties of MTO under high pressure through first-principles calculations. Both R-3 and P21/n phases of MTO are antiferromagnetic at zero temperature. The R-3 phase transforms to the P21/n phase at 7.58 GPa, accompanied by a considerable volume collapse of about 6.47%. Employing the accurate method that combines DFT+U and G0W0, the calculated band gap of R-3 phase at zero pressure is very close to the experimental values, while that of the P21/n phase is significantly overestimated. The main reason for this difference is that the experimental study incorrectly used the Kubelka-Munk plot for the indirect band gap to obtain the band gap of the P21/n phase instead of the Kubelka-Munk plot for the direct band gap. Furthermore, our study reveals that the transition from the R-3 phase to the P21/n phase is accompanied by a slight reduction in the band gap.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study on the Structural and Thermodynamic Properties of U-He compounds under High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uranium is considered as a very important nuclear energy material because of the huge amount of energy released. As the main products of spontaneous decay of uranium, helium is difficult to react with uranium for its chemical inertness. Therefore, bubbles will be formed inside uranium, which could greatly reduce the performance of uranium or cause the safety problems. Additionally, nuclear materials are usually operated in an environment of high-temperature and high-pressure, so it is necessary to figure out the exact state of helium inside uranium at extreme conditions. Here, we explored the structural stability of U-He system under high-pressure and high-temperature by using density functional theory calculations. Two metastable phases are found between 50 and 400 GPa: U4He with space group Fmmm and U6He with space group P-1. Both are metallic and adopt layered structures. Electron localization function calculation combined with charge density difference analysis indicate that there are covalent bonds between U and U atoms in both Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He. Compared with the elastic modulus of ${\alpha}$-U, the addition of helium has certain influence on the mechanical properties of uranium. Besides, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He at high-temperature. It is found that Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He undergo one-dimensional superionic phase transitions at 150 GPa. Our study revealed exotic structure of U-He compounds beyond the form of bubble under high-pressure and high-temperature, that might be relevant to the performance and safety issue of nuclear materials at extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>${\it Asparagus}$: A Toolkit for Autonomous, User-Guided Construction of Machine-Learned Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the establishment of machine learning (ML) techniques in the scientific community, the construction of ML potential energy surfaces (ML-PES) has become a standard process in physics and chemistry. So far, improvements in the construction of ML-PES models have been conducted independently, creating an initial hurdle for new users to overcome and complicating the reproducibility of results. Aiming to reduce the bar for the extensive use of ML-PES, we introduce ${\it Asparagus}$, a software package encompassing the different parts into one coherent implementation that allows an autonomous, user-guided construction of ML-PES models. ${\it Asparagus}$ combines capabilities of initial data sampling with interfaces to ${\it ab
  initio}$ calculation programs, ML model training, as well as model evaluation and its application within other codes such as ASE or CHARMM. The functionalities of the code are illustrated in different examples, including the dynamics of small molecules, the representation of reactive potentials in organometallic compounds, and atom diffusion on periodic surface structures. The modular framework of ${\it Asparagus}$ is designed to allow simple implementations of further ML-related methods and models to provide constant user-friendly access to state-of-the-art ML techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy excitations may manifest intricate behaviors of correlated electron systems and provide essential insights into the dynamics of quantum states and phase transitions. We study a two-orbital Hubbard model featuring the so-called holon-doublon low-energy excitations in the Mott insulating narrow band in the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP). We employ an improved dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) technique to calculate the spectral functions at zero temperature. We show that the holon-doublon bound state is not the sole component of the low-energy excitations. Instead, it should be a bound state composed of a Kondo-like state in the wide band and a doublon in the narrow band, named inter-band Kondo-like (IBK) bound states. Notably, as the bandwidths of the two bands approach each other, we find anomalous IBK bound-state excitations in the metallic {\em wide} band.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ionic conductivity of lithium in Li$_7$PS$_6$ argyrodite via dopant engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Li-containing argyrodites represent a promising family of Li-ion conductors with several derived compounds exhibiting room-temperature ionic conductivity &gt; 1 mS/cm and making them attractive as potential candidates as electrolytes in solid-state Li-ion batteries. Starting from the parent phase Li7PS6, several cation and anion substitution strategies have been attempted to increase the conductivity of Li ions. Nonetheless, a detailed understanding of the thermodynamics of native defects and doping of Li argyrodite and their effect on the ionic conductivity of Li is missing. Here, we report a comprehensive computational study of defect chemistry of the parent phase Li7PS6 in both intrinsic and extrinsic regimes, using a newly developed workflow to automate the computations of several defect formation energies in a thermodynamically consistent framework. Our findings agree with known experimental findings, rule out several unfavorable aliovalent dopants, narrowing down the potential promising candidates that can be tested experimentally. We also find that cation-anion co-doping can provide a powerful strategy to further optimize the composition of argyrodite. In particular, Si-F co-doping is predicted to be thermodynamically favorable; this could lead to the synthesis of the first F-doped Li-containing argyrodite. Finally, using DeePMD neural networks, we have mapped the ionic conductivity landscape as function of the concentration of the most promising cation and anion dopants identified from the defect calculations, and identified the most promising region in the compositional space with high Li conductivity that can be explored experimentally.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Muffin Tin Orbitals (EWMTO) within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a new efficient basis for the electronic structure problem. The basis is based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the eigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called Muffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by appropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to problem of finding the ground state electron density is most often done through an iterative process, where generically on the order of over 20 iterations are taken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest values allowed by the correlation and exchange functional for the fixed form of the external potential. We use eigenstate information from the previous convergence iteration to choose the energies of the eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter as they are cancelled out. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic structure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close packed form where ASA is particularly accurate.</description>

      <title>Revealing the molecular structures of a-Al2O3(0001)-water interface by machine learning based computational vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-water interfaces are crucial to many physical and chemical processes and are extensively studied using surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. To establish clear correlations between specific spectral signatures and distinct interfacial water structures, theoretical calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are required. These MD simulations typically need relatively long trajectories (a few nanoseconds) to achieve reliable SFG response function calculations via the dipole-polarizability time correlation function. However, the requirement for long trajectories limits the use of computationally expensive techniques such as ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, particularly for complex solid-water interfaces. In this work, we present a pathway for calculating vibrational spectra (IR, Raman, SFG) of solid-water interfaces using machine learning (ML)-accelerated methods. We employ both the dipole moment-polarizability correlation function and the surface-specific velocity-velocity correlation function approaches to calculate SFG spectra. Our results demonstrate the successful acceleration of AIMD simulations and the calculation of SFG spectra using ML methods. This advancement provides an opportunity to calculate SFG spectra for the complicated solid-water systems more rapidly and at a lower computational cost with the aid of ML.</description>

      <title>An implicit adaptive unified gas-kinetic scheme for steady-state solutions of non-equilibrium flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium flows have been frequently encountered in various aerospace engineering applications. To understand nonequilibrium physics, multiscale effects, and the dynamics in these applications, an effective and reliable multiscale scheme for all flow regimes is required. Following the direct modeling methodology, the adaptive unified gas-kinetic scheme employs discrete velocity space (DVS) to accurately capture the non-equilibrium physics, recovering the original unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), and adaptively employs continuous distribution functions based on the Chapman-Enskog expansion to achieve better efficiency. Different regions are dynamically coupled at the cell interface through the fluxes from the discrete and continuous gas distribution functions, thereby avoiding any buffer zone between them. In the current study, an implicit adaptive unified gas-kinetic scheme (IAUGKS) is constructed to further enhance the efficiency of steady-state solutions. The current scheme employs implicit macroscopic governing equations and couples them with implicit microscopic governing equations within the non-equilibrium region, resulting in high convergence efficiency in all flow regimes. A series of numerical tests were conducted for high Mach number flows around diverse geometries such as a cylinder, a sphere, an X-38-like vehicle, and a space station. The current scheme can capture the non-equilibrium physics and provide accurate predictions of surface quantities. In comparison with the original UGKS, the velocity space adaptation, unstructured DVS, and implicit iteration significantly improve the efficiency by one or two orders of magnitude. Given its exceptional efficiency and accuracy, the IAUGKS serves as an effective tool for nonequilibrium flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Inferring turbulent velocity and temperature fields and their statistics from Lagrangian velocity measurements using physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15727v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data. This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>Selection pressure/Noise driven cooperative behaviour in the thermodynamic limit of repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the scenario where an infinite number of players (i.e., the \textit{thermodynamic} limit) find themselves in a Prisoner's dilemma type situation, in a \textit{repeated} setting. Is it reasonable to anticipate that, in these circumstances, cooperation will emerge? This paper addresses this question by examining the emergence of cooperative behaviour, in the presence of \textit{noise} (or, under \textit{selection pressure}), in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, involving strategies such as \textit{Tit-for-Tat}, \textit{Always Defect}, \textit{GRIM}, \textit{Win-Stay, Lose-Shift}, and others. To analyze these games, we employ a numerical Agent-Based Model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash Equilibrium Mapping (NEM) technique, both based on the \textit{1D}-Ising chain. We use \textit{game magnetization} as an indicator of cooperative behaviour. A significant finding is that for some repeated games, a discontinuity in the game magnetization indicates a \textit{first}-order \textit{selection pressure/noise}-driven phase transition. The phase transition is particular to strategies where players do not severely punish a single defection. We also observe that in these particular cases, the phase transition critically depends on the number of \textit{rounds} the game is played in the thermodynamic limit. For all five games, we find that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with game magnetization, provide crucial inputs on how cooperative behaviour can emerge in an infinite-player repeated Prisoner's dilemma game.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Phonon Scattering Effects on Thermal Conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have demonstrated that multi-phonon scattering processes substantially influence the thermal conductivity of materials, posing significant computational challenges for classical simulations as the complexity of phonon modes escalates. This study examines the potential of quantum simulations to address these challenges, utilizing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era (NISQ) quantum computational capabilities and quantum error mitigation techniques to optimize thermal conductivity calculations. Employing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we simulate phonon-phonon contributions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). Our methodology involves mapping multi-phonon scattering systems to fermionic spin operators, necessitating the creation of a customized ansatz to balance circuit accuracy and depth. We construct the system within Fock space using bosonic operators and transform the Hamiltonian into the sum of Pauli operators suitable for quantum computation. By addressing the impact of non-unitary noise effects, we benchmark the noise influence and implement error mitigation strategies to develop a more efficient model for quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Invertible Coarse Graining with Physics-Informed Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale molecular modeling is widely applied in scientific research of molecular properties over large time and length scales. Two specific challenges are commonly present in multiscale modeling, provided that information between the coarse and fine representations of molecules needs to be properly exchanged: One is to construct coarse grained models by passing information from the fine to coarse levels; the other is to restore finer molecular details given coarse grained configurations. Although these two problems are commonly addressed independently, in this work, we present a theory connecting them, and develop a methodology called Cycle Coarse Graining (CCG) to solve both problems in a unified manner. In CCG, reconstruction can be achieved via a tractable deep generative model, allowing retrieval of fine details from coarse-grained simulations. The reconstruction in turn delivers better coarse-grained models which are informed of the fine-grained physics, and enables calculation of the free energies in a rare-event-free manner. CCG thus provides a systematic way for multiscale molecular modeling, where the finer details of coarse-grained simulations can be efficiently retrieved, and the coarse-grained models can be improved consistently.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional phase-field simulations of water freezing and thawing at pore-scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with numerical simulation of water freezing and thawing in a complex three-dimensional geometry of a porous medium. The porous structure is represented by a virtual container filled with glass beads. Phase transition modeling is approached at both macro-scale and micro-scale, combining heat transfer in a heterogeneous medium and a phase-field approximation of the Gibbs-Thomson relation by means of the Allen-Cahn equation. The formulation of the model contains novel components tailored for the given purpose. At the macro-scale, surface tension effects are negligible and phase transition focusing based on temperature can replace the Allen-Cahn equation. In contrast to that, simulations of equilibrium states at the micro-scale allow to eliminate the heat equation by assuming constant supercooling. For numerical solution, an efficient hybrid parallel algorithm based on the finite volume method and the Runge-Kutta-Merson solver with adaptive time stepping are employed. The results of different model variants at different scales are discussed. In a parametric study, the full phase-field model is demonstrated to deliver consistent results across a wide range of surface tension values, exhibiting curvature-induced premelting if surface tension is artificially exaggerated. As surface tension tends to the realistic values, the results of the phase-field approach those of the simplifed temperature-driven phase transition model. In addition, micro-scale simulations of water freezing at different supercooling values aim to predict the unfrozen water content and compare the results with data from literature. Numerical stability, accuracy, and computational costs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameter optimization analysis of dynamical quantum critical phenomena in long-range transverse-field Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic. In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class. The leading order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically. Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, $\sigma$, we investigate $\sigma$-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes. We successfully determine the universality boundary between the latter two as $\sigma = 7/4$ based on the dynamical exponent and settle a long-standing dispute on the location of the universality boundary.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding of bonding is key to modelling materials and predicting properties thereof. A widely adopted indicator of bonds and atomic shells is the electron localization function (ELF). The building blocks of the ELF are also used in the construction of modern density functional approximations. Here we demonstrate that the ELF breaks down when applied beyond regular non-relativistic quantum states. We show that for tackling general non-collinear open-shell solutions, it is essential to address both the U(1) gauge invariance -- i.e., invariance under a multiplication by a position dependent phase factor -- and SU(2) gauge invariance -- i.e. invariance under local spin rotations -- {\em conjointly}. Remarkably, we find that the extended ELF also improves the description of paradigmatic collinear states.</description>
