      <title>Assessing Students' Understanding of Uncertainty in Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Courses at a Major Canadian University: Longitudinal Results and Misconceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last five years, McGill University's Office of Science Education (OSE) has partnered with faculty members from the Department of Physics to form an education working group with the aim of charting the progression of students' conceptual understanding of uncertainties across their undergraduate degree. The research conducted by this group seeks to provide further insight into both the experimental skill set that students gain through undergraduate laboratory courses and how the department could address noticeable gaps in student understanding. In this paper, we evaluate the conceptual understanding of uncertainty using the Concise Data Processing Assessment (CDPA) instrument. First, we characterize the physics laboratory curriculum at McGill University by evaluating the evolution of CDPA scores across consecutive laboratory courses, and further propose the utilization of this tool for identifying gaps in student understanding. Following the analysis of student responses (N=2023), we specifically investigate data collected in second-year courses to better diagnose what student errors can tell us about common misconceptions in experimental physics. This more in-depth research focuses on data collected from students at the beginning and the end of their first full year of experimental laboratory courses, consisting of two consecutive laboratory courses that build on each other. By the end of the second course, students have engaged with all the material covered in the CDPA test. Interestingly, there have been no changes in CDPA total scores throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We notice a marked upward shift in student understanding; however, the results indicate that a significant portion of students continue to struggle with uncertainties, basic data analysis, and curve fitting.</description>

      <title>Building Bridges: AI Custom Chatbots as Mediators between Mathematics and Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the integration of AI custom chatbots in educational settings, with a particular focus on their applicability in the context of mathematics and physics. In view of the increasing deployment of AI tools such as ChatGPT in educational contexts, the present study examines their potential as personalized tutoring systems. The study assesses the impact of AI-generated learning materials on the learning experiences and performance of sixth-grade students, with a particular focus on proportional relationships in mathematical and physical contexts. The randomized controlled study with N = 214 students compared traditional textbook materials with explanations generated by a custom chatbot. The results demonstrated that while AI-generated materials had an indefinite impact on learning outcomes, they significantly enhanced positive-activating emotions, situational interest, and self-efficacy, while reducing intrinsic and extrinsic cognitive load. These findings underscore the potential of AI to transform educational practices by fostering a superior learning experience. However, further research is required to clarify its impact on learning performance and long-term learning outcomes. The study highlights the importance of careful integration and customization of AI tools to maximize their benefits in physics education.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>
