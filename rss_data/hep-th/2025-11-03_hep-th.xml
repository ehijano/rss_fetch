      <title>Revisiting Schr\"odinger CFTs: Factorization, Massless Particles, and a Path to the Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Schr\"odinger CFTs from a modern point of view. We introduce the ''harmonic trap geometry,'' analogous to the cylinder picture in relativistic CFTs, and demonstrate a state-operator correspondence that applies to all operators, including descendant, massless, and ''normal-ordered operators.'' A thermofield double construction plays an extremely important role. We systematically classify all physical spectra in the harmonic trap and their unitarity bounds, extending earlier results to include both massless and massive states of all spins, providing a new analytic treatment of unitarity bounds, and establishing foundations for a bootstrap. In our reformulation, previously known perturbative non-renormalization theorems follow immediately from non-perturbative factorization at fixed points and along RG flows. Massless states are described by an effective 1d CFT, as predicted by DLCQ, and violate the non-renormalization theorems. We include a self-consistent review of Schr\"odinger CFTs in our framework, making the paper accessible to anyone with a field theory background.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from restriction theory and rapid-decay homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for computing frequency-domain gravitational waveforms from relativistic binary scattering in different asymptotic regimes. The method yields a controlled series expansion that can in principle be extended to arbitrary order in the relevant kinematic parameter. By combining differential-equation techniques with restriction theory and algebraic-geometry methods for impact-parameter-space Fourier integrals, we derive recursion relations that generate the leading-order (tree-level) waveform in both the soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes, establishing a proof of principle for extending the approach to higher-loop computations. Finally, following constraints from rapid-decay homology, we show that the Fourier integrals underlying the waveform satisfy epsilon-form differential equations mixing Bessel- and exponential-type kernels, marking a first step toward uncovering the analytic structure of the exact solution.</description>

      <title>$Q$-ball superradiance: Analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that waves scattering off a $Q$-ball can extract energy from it. We present an analytical treatment of this process by adopting a multi-step function approximation for the background field, which yields perturbative solutions expressed in terms of Bessel functions. For thin-wall $Q$-balls, the amplification factors reduce to simple sinusoidal functions, which explains the multi-peak structure of the spectrum and identifies the physical quantities that determine it. For instance, at high frequencies, the peak spacing is simply the inverse of the $Q$-ball size. The analytical solution further enables us to delineate the full range of possible amplification factors. For general $Q$-balls, this analytical framework also substantially improves the efficiency of evaluating the amplification factors.</description>

      <title>Families of Hitchin Systems in Type-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coulomb branch geometry of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT is encoded in the data of a complex integrable system. In class-S, this is the Hitchin System (of ADE type) on the punctured curves $C$ on which we compactified from 6d to 4d. As we vary the complex structure of $C$, these fit together to form a (nontrivial!) bundle of Hitchin systems over the moduli space of complex structures of $C$ (the ``conformal manifold'' of the family of SCFTs). We carry out that construction for type-D. Compared to the type-A case, the construction is much more complicated because of local constraints at the punctures. Those local constraints were studied in [1]. Here, we work out their implications for the global bundle of spectral (Seiberg-Witten) curves.</description>

      <title>Flavor entanglement in pion-pion scattering at one-loop in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the defining features of quantum mechanics is the ability of two systems to exhibit correlation of information even when they are spatially separated by large distances. This phenomenon, known as quantum entanglement, is a fundamental resource for quantum computation and emerging quantum technologies. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the generation of entanglement in particle interactions requires a quantitative description of the entanglement produced by fundamental interactions. For the strong interaction, this work presents an analysis of the flavor entanglement generated in pion-pion scattering at one-loop order in chiral perturbation theory. The amount of entanglement is quantified using the quantum mutual information, expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropy. The calculation is performed under fixed pion momenta and initial flavor indices, with the incoming pions assumed to be in a pure, unentangled state. It is shown that the resulting flavor entanglement depends on whether the initial pion flavors are identical or distinct. At threshold, the quantum mutual information reaches approximately 2.8 in the identical-flavor case, close to the maximal value for a pair of qutrits, and equals 2 in the distinct-flavor case, corresponding to the maximal entanglement of two qubits. Analytical expressions for the mutual information at other kinematical regimes are also provided.</description>

      <title>Energy Detectors and Asymptotic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study detector operators measuring energy to a power $\Delta-2$ at null infinity in four-dimensional gauge theories and gravity. These operators transform as conformal primaries on the celestial sphere and provide a natural basis for describing energy-flux observables in scattering processes. Using the collinear factorization of scattering amplitudes, we derive the universal leading structure of the operator product expansion. A key consequence of our analysis is the precise identification of the $\Delta=2$ detector, the number operator. Exploiting the fact that soft charges generate symmetries of the S-matrix, we demonstrate that the number of particles is entirely determined by the product of two soft currents: in gravity, the operator is the square of the supertranslation generator, while in Yang-Mills yields a product of $SU(N)$ Kac-Moody soft currents. This work establishes thus a direct link between detector observables and the soft sector of celestial holography.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian QFT: relativistic scattering and symmetry structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitarity is a cornerstone of quantum theory, ensuring the conservation of probability and information. Although non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically associated with open or dissipative systems, pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics shows that real spectra and unitary evolution can still emerge through a suitably defined inner product. Motivated by this insight, we extend the pseudo-Hermitian framework to relativistic quantum field theory and construct a consistent formulation of scattering processes. A novel structural feature of this theory is the presence of distinct metric operators for the in and out sectors, connected through a nontrivial metric projector that guarantees global probability conservation under pseudo-unitary time evolution. We further develop a general symmetry formalism, showing that each symmetry generally corresponds to two pseudo-unitary operators associated with the in and out metrics, respectively. Within this framework, the scattering matrix admits a perturbative expansion through the Dyson series and remains Lorentz invariant and unitary, remarkably in complete agreement with the conventional Hermitian case. The fundamental CPT theorem is also shown to hold. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for interacting pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories and open new directions for exploring their possible physical implications beyond the standard Hermitian paradigm.</description>

      <title>Boundary Integrability from the Fuzzy Three Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\mathfrak{so}_4$ invariant matrix product states (MPS) in the $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric integrable spin chain and prove their integrability. These MPS appear as fuzzy three-sphere solutions of matrix models with Yang-Mills-type interactions, and in particular they correspond to scalar defect sectors of $N=4$ SYM. We find that the algebra formed by the fuzzy three-sphere generators naturally leads to a boundary reflection algebra and hence a solution to the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for every representation of the fuzzy three-sphere. This allows us to find closed formula for the overlaps of Bethe states of $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric chains with the fuzzy three-sphere MPS for arbitrary bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Contour Integral for the Partition Function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ Topologically Twisted on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and Physical Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the contour integral for the partition function of an $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ topologically twisted theory on $\mathbb{CP}^2$, dimensionally reducing from an $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory on $S^5$. Earlier works presented the partition function as a sum over three equivariant fluxes, one for each toric divisor of $\mathbb{CP}^2$. Our result depends only on a single physical flux, assigned to the non-trivial two-cycle of the manifold. The reduced summation over fluxes is compensated by a contour of integration, arising from a different solution of the BPS equations, which captures more poles in each topological sector. As our observable involves a position-dependent Yang-Mills coupling, we compute new equivariant invariants of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which reduce to Donaldson invariants in the non-equivariant limit. Stability conditions of gauge bundles over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ appear intrinsically via the dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ Universality at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of integrated correlators for an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory on a squashed sphere with SU$(N)$ gauge group and fundamental/anti-symmetric matter. Employing the matrix model arising from supersymmetric localisation, we compute derivatives of the partition function $\mathcal{Z}$ with respect to the fundamental mass ($\mu$), the anti-symmetric mass ($m$) and the squashing parameter ($b$), corresponding to integrated insertions of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ flavour-current and stress-tensor multiplets, which are holographically dual to gluon and graviton scatterings in the presence of D7-branes. For correlators dual to only graviton scatterings, we confirm the planar-limit equivalence with $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Our main result is a remarkable universality for the mixed gluon-graviton scattering amplitudes off D7-branes, obtained from $\partial_\mu^2 \partial_m^2 \log \mathcal{Z}$ and $\partial_\mu^2 \partial_b^2 \log \mathcal{Z}$. We show that the leading and sub-leading large-$N$ contributions in the strong-coupling regime are governed by universal asymptotic series, identical to those found for integrated giant-graviton correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. We also propose an $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$-invariant completion of these results in terms of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. This completion provides exact constraints on higher-derivative terms in the dual $\text{AdS}_5$ brane-string amplitudes and highlights an unexpected universality across distinct superconformal theories at strong coupling.</description>

Abstract: We show how any given system of ordinary differential equations in $n$-dimensional configuration space can be obtained from a peculiar variational problem with one local symmetry. The obtained action functional leads to the Hamiltonian formulation in $(4n+2)$-dimensional phase space. As concrete examples, we discuss the cases of Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, as well as the equations of motion with dissipative (frictional) forces.</description>

      <title>Cosmological and High Energy Physics implications from gravitational-wave background searches in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O1-O4a runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations, primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered. We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conformal regularization of Gauss-Bonnet gravity in four-dimensional Riemann-Cartan geometry, employing a consistent dimensional derivative scheme. Within this regularized framework, we derive the complete field equations and construct novel static spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Our central finding is that the regularized Gauss-Bonnet term acts as an intrinsic source for a long-range torsion field, providing a purely four-dimensional mechanism to sustain torsion as a hair on black holes, without reliance on extra dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Ruffini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 (2025) 8, 081403] pointed out that the repetitive Penrose process cannot drain the entire extractable energy of a Kerr black hole. In this Letter, we further point out that the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole cannot drop down to exactly zero via the repetitive electric Penrose process that is terminated after a finite number of iterative steps, indicating a thermodynamical third-law analog for the repetitive electric Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Entropy transport in closed quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate entropy transport for universal scaling phenomena in closed quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium. From spatially resolved experimental data of a spinor Bose gas, we demonstrate that entropy decreases on long-distance scales while it increases at short distances. A dynamical separation of scales leads to macrophysics with long-range order, which is insensitive to the highly entropic microphysical processes. Since the total von Neumann entropy is conserved on a fundamental level for the quantum system, our analysis reveals a reciprocal connection between the emergence of macroscopic structure and microscopic disorder. To illustrate the scope of this connection, we exemplify the universal phenomenon also in a relativistic quantum field theory calculation from first principles, which is relevant for particle physics and early-universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Trapping-potential dependence of the unitary Fermi gas at the BCS-BEC crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments which measure Fermi-gas properties near unitarity confine fermionic atoms to a region of space using trapping potentials of various shapes. The presence of a trapping potential introduces a new characteristic physical scale in the superfluid EFT which, inter alia, describes the acoustic branch of excitations in the far infrared well below the scale of the superfluid gap. In this EFT there is a clear hierarchy of scales, and corrections to the homogeneous system due to the trapping potential may be organized into three regions with distinct power counting that relies on both the EFT derivative expansion, and the WKB approximation, which is an expansion in gradients of the trapping potential. The energy spectrum of the superfluid system is obtained in each of the regions by explicit computation of the phonon-field fluctuations, and by the modifications to the dynamic structure factor due to the corresponding density fluctuations. The most significant deviations from linear dispersion due to the trapping potential are found in the far infrared region of the superfluid EFT.</description>

      <title>Running Couplings in High-Temperature Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalization-group evolution of parameters in the three-dimensional effective field theory (3D EFT) that describes the thermally driven electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field. We focus on the first-order case, triggered by beyond the Standard Model physics. We compute the two-loop running of the 3D EFT couplings, including the effect of the leading non-renormalizable terms. We then analyze how the new contributions to the beta functions compare with those in the super-renormalizable case, highlighting their impact on perturbative computations of the scalar potential, which describes the vacuum structure of the theory. By incorporating higher-order corrections in the mass parameter evolution, as well as the running of other effective operators, we set the stage for testing their impact on phase transition dynamics in lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity through Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space. The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Axial Gravitational Normal Modes of Uniform Density Star in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article studies the dynamical behavior of axial gravitational perturbations of homogeneous stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Because the radial coordinate $r$ transforms into the tortoise coordinate $y = y(r)$, obeying $y(r=0)=0$ and $y(r\rightarrow\infty)=y_\text{max}&lt;\infty$, the tortoise coordinates domain is finite, and the gravitational waves fail to reach out of the domain. Thus, from the perspective of tortoise coordinates, the perturbation equation of uniform density stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime is analogous to the infinite deep potential well in quantum mechanics. Therefore, the perturbative behavior in this spacetime represents a standing wave vibration. Here we use shooting method and finite difference method to show the imagery of standing waves in this spacetime for $n=0,1,2$ as examples. On the other hand, by finite difference method, a Gaussian wave packet bounces back and forth within this potential well. Furthermore, due to the shape of the gravitational potential function $V$ within the range $0\le y\le y_\text{max}$, an echo phenomenon occurs at the surface of the star. As the energy of the wave packet remains within the potential well, each time it traverses the surface of the star, a reflective echo is generated. Consequently, after multiple reflections, the Gaussian wave packet cannot maintain its original shape and ultimately disperses.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary difference equation and affine Laumon space III : Generalization to $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers we have considered a non-stationary difference equation which was originally discovered for the deformed Virasoro conformal block. The equation involves mass parameters and, when they are tuned appropriately, the equation is regarded as a quantum KZ equation for $U_q(A_{1}^{(1)})$. We introduce a $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$ generalization of the non-stationary difference equation. The Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of $q$-commuting variables and allows both factorized forms and a normal ordered form. By specializing the mass parameters appropriately, the Hamiltonian can be identified with the $R$-matrix of the symmetric tensor representation of $U_q(A_{N-1}^{(1)})$, which in turn comes from the 3D (tetrahedron) $R$-matrix. We conjecture that the affine Laumon partition function of type $A_{N-1}^{(1)}$ gives a solution to our $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$ non-stationary difference equation. As a check of our conjecture, we work out the four dimensional limit and find that the non-stationary difference equation reduces to the Fuji-Suzuki-Tsuda system.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-photon coupling from the Global 21-cm Signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A radiation field can be excited via parametric resonance when an oscillating axion field couples to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons interaction. As demonstrated in previous works, this mechanism can generate primordial magnetic fields shortly after recombination and provide sufficient ultraviolet radiation for the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). In this study, I analyze constraints on the parametric resonance scenario from global 21cm observations. I find that there exist viable regions in the parameter space that satisfy both observational limits and the physical requirements of the magnetic field and DCBH formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dense Circumstellar Medium around Pulsating Massive Stars Powering Interacting Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~M_\odot$ focusing on the effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including a parameterized prescription for pulsation-driven superwinds and time-averaged mass loss rates attributed to resulting shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $10^{-4}-10^{-2}~M_\odot~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($&gt;10^{-15}~\rm{gcm}^{-3}$ at distances $&lt;10^{15}$ cm) -- consistent with those inferred from multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN~2023ixf and SN~2020ywx.</description>

      <title>Differential Models for Anderson Dual to Twisted $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-Bordism and Twisted Anomaly Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct differential models for twisted $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-bordism and for its Anderson dual, and employ the latter to define a twisted anomaly map whose source is the differential twisted $K$-theory. Our differential model for the twisted Anderson dual follows the formalism developed in [YY23]. To connect these constructions with the geometric framework of the Atiyah-Singer index theory, we further present a gerbe-theoretic formulation of our models in terms of bundle gerbes and gerbe modules [Mur96] [BCMMS02].
  Within this geometric setting, we define the twisted anomaly map \[ \widehat{\Phi}_{\widehat{\mathcal{G}}}\colon
  \widehat{K}^{0}(X,\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{-1})
  \longrightarrow
  \bigl(\widehat{I\Omega^{\mathrm{Spin}^c}_{\mathrm{dR}}}\bigr)^{n}(X,\widehat{\mathcal{G}}), \] whose construction naturally involves the reduced eta-invariant of Dirac operators acting on Clifford modules determined by the twisted data. Conceptually, this map is expected to encode the anomalies of twisted $1|1$-dimensional supersymmetric field theories, in accordance with the perspectives developed in [ST11] and [FH21].</description>

      <title>Holographic equation of state matched with hadron gas equation as a tool for the study of the quark-gluon plasma evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the matching of the holographic equation of state with the equation of Hadron Resonance Gas for studying the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Machine learning methods are applied to the calibration of model's free parameters using the lattice QCD results for the physical values of quark masses. One of the most advanced procedures for matching is used with the function that approximate behavior of both models on particular limit adopted from NEOS equation. Final hadronic spectra are obtained within multi-staged numerical approach of the iEBE-MUSIC and SMASH-vHLLE packages. The code of relativistic hydrodynamics is modified by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches are utilized at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the complete three-loop QCD soft anomalous dimension for multileg amplitudes involving a single massive coloured particle and any number of massless ones. This is achieved by applying a novel strategy based on a lightcone expansion of correlators of semi-infinite Wilson lines using the method of regions. The resulting region integrals depend exclusively on rescaling-invariant ratios that remain finite in the limit. We evaluate these integrals using differential equation techniques. The result is written in terms of uniform weight five generalised polylogarithms of a twelve letter alphabet in three variables, and is compatible with the massless limit as well as with two- and three-particle collinear factorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time. In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Hamiltonian formulation, Quantum Field Theory calculations scale exponentially with spatial volume, making real-time simulations intractable on classical computers and motivating quantum computation approaches. In Hamiltonian quantisation, bosonic fields introduce the additional challenge of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We present a scalable quantum algorithm for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an Abelian gauge field theory in higher than one spatial dimensions, designed to address this limit while preserving gauge invariance. In our formulation, Gauss's law is automatically satisfied when the implementation remains fully gauge invariant. We demonstrate how gauge invariance is maintained throughout the lattice discretisation, digitisation, and qubitisation procedures, and identify the most efficient representation for extending to large Hilbert space dimensions. Within this framework, we benchmark several quantum error mitigation techniques and find the calibration method to perform most effectively. The approach scales naturally to larger lattices, and we implement and test the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional setups on current quantum hardware. Our results indicate that next-generation quantum platforms could enable reliable, fully quantum simulations of large-scale QED dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has intensified the need for efficient, high-precision modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current analytical methods, primarily the Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian expansions, are inherently perturbative, while numerical relativity remains computationally expensive. In this Letter, we introduce a middle path: an exact renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems. We demonstrate that our equation correctly reproduces the first three orders of the Post-Minkowskian expansion. Crucially, it provides a framework for non-perturbative approximations. As a first application, we show that our method efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, bypassing the need for complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic nonlinearity of the RG flow. This establishes the exact RG as a powerful new tool for tackling strong-field dynamics in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are thought to propagate unattenuated through matter due to a cancellation between graviton absorption and stimulated emission inferred from leading-order soft-graviton arguments. We revisit this reasoning and show that it fails for the converse problem: the effect of a gravitational-wave background on matter. For unstable particles, real graviton emission \emph{and} absorption appear to enhance decay rates. By extending the soft-graviton framework describing real and virtual processes in a gravitational wave background, and resumming them to all orders, we show that inclusive decay rates remain essentially unchanged. The mutual transparency between matter and gravitational radiation thus follows from infrared safety, and not from a fortuitous cancellation in the lowest-order approximation of exclusive rates.</description>

Abstract: We explore the nature of running couplings in the higher derivative linear and nonlinear sigma models and show that the results in dimensional regularization for the physical running couplings do not always match the values quoted in the literature. Heat kernel methods identify divergences correctly, but not all of these divergences are related to physical running couplings. Likewise the running found using the Functional Renormalization Group does not always appear as running couplings in physical processes, even for the case of logarithmic running. The basic coupling of the higher derivative SU(N) nonlinear sigma model does not run at all at one loop, in contrast to published claims for asymptotic freedom. At one loop we describe how to properly identify the physical running couplings in these theories, and provide revised numbers for the higher derivative nonlinear sigma model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to Y. Nakayama and T. Tanaka, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a concrete and computable realization of the $ER=EPR$ conjecture, by deriving the Einstein-Rosen bridge from the quantum entanglement in the thermofield double CFT. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the wormhole is explicitly identified as an entanglement entropy between subsystems of the thermofield double state. Furthermore, our results provide a quantitative verification of Van Raamsdonk's conjecture about spacetime emergence.</description>

      <title>Marginal deformations of SU(2)$_k$ WZW model boundary states in open string field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attempt to describe the moduli space of boundary states in the SU(2)$_k$ WZW model by constructing marginally deformed solutions in open string field theory in the level truncation approximation. In contrast with other approaches to marginal deformations, our solutions exhibit a $g$-function different from that of the background (typically lower). Thus, our method effectively combines features of both marginal and relevant deformations. After partially fixing an SU(2) symmetry of the equations of motion, we find families of solutions parameterized by the coefficient of the marginal field associated with the $J^3$ current, and we identify them as Cardy boundary states with varying angle $\theta$. However, it turns out that these solutions become inconsistent once the marginal parameter exceeds a certain value, implying that they cover only a part of the moduli space. Finally, we also compare the relation between the marginal parameter and the angle $\theta$ for different solutions and we find evidence suggesting that this relation is universal for certain classes of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the smoothness of the classical limit of inclusive observables in the formalism developed by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC). Building on the earlier work [1-3], we prove that the classical limit of three classes of inclusive observables, namely scattering angle, radiative field and angular impulse is smooth and does not suffer from any so-called super-classical divergences at all orders in perturbation. Our analysis goes some way in showing that KMOC formalism can be used to compute classical radiation by simply focusing on all the terms that scale as $\hbar^{0}$ as all the terms that scale with inverse power of $\hbar$ vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlators of large-scale fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation are major observables of inflationary cosmology. In cosmological collider physics, many interesting correlators are generated through loop processes. However, ultraviolet divergences often appear when computing the loop correlators, and a regularization is required. In this work, K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and dimensional regularization are used to analytically compute various correlators with a bubble loop of massive bulk propagators in de Sitter spacetime. Examples include 4-point and 2-point correlators with 1-loop bubble exchanges of derivatively coupled massive scalars or massive spin-1 bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum and classical systems defined by the quantum corner symmetry group $QCS = \widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes H_3$, which arises in the context of quantum gravity. In particular, we relate the quantum observables, defined by representation-theoretic data, to their classical counterparts through generalized Perelomov coherent states and the framework of Berezin quantization. The resulting procedure provides a mathematically well-defined notion of the semi-classical limit of quantum gravity, viewed as the representation theory of the corner symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to unpolarized and polarized SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process requires the presence of an identified hadron H$'$ in the final state, which arises from the scattering of a lepton with an initial hadron P. By employing factorization in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), SIDIS provides essential knowledge on the hadron structure, enabling the exploration of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). The coefficient functions for SIDIS can be calculated in perturbative QCD and are currently known to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for the cases, where the incoming lepton and the hadron P are either both polarized or unpolarized. We present a detailed description of these NNLO computations, including a thorough discussion of all the partonic channels, the calculation of the amplitudes and master integrals for the phase-space integration as well as the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences and mass factorization of infrared divergences in dimensional regularization through NNLO. We provide an extensive phenomenological analysis of the effects of NNLO corrections on SIDIS cross sections for different PDFs and FFs and various kinematics, including those of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We find that these corrections are not only significant but also crucial for reducing the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ to obtain stable predictions.</description>

      <title>Role of the short-range dynamics in simultaneous interpretation of $P_{cs}$ pentaqurks via $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm molecular states in $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ systems using the one-boson exchange model. By regulating the short-range interactions with parameter $a$ and cutoff $\Lambda$, we found ten bound states in isoscalar systems. Our analysis reveals that if the LHCb Collaboration's $P_{cs}(4459)$ and Belle Collaboration's $P_{cs}(4472)$ pentaqurks are indeed distinct states, their mass splitting can be resolved through $\Xi_c^{\prime}\bar{D}$-$\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ coupled channel dynamics using consistent model parameters. This framework assigns $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ spin-parity quantum numbers to $P_{cs}(4459)$ and $P_{cs}(4472)$, respectively. With this consistent model parameter, we predict several new molecular candidates in the $4.3-4.7$ GeV mass region, demonstrating the crucial interplay between coupled channel effects and short-range dynamics in understanding hidden-charm pentaquarks as hadronic molecules. Additionally, we investigate the effects of $\Lambda\eta_c$ and $\Lambda J/\psi$ decay channels on the predicted molecular states, showing how these channels influence pole positions and provide insights into the detectability of these states through different production mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop trackers can also occur.</description>

Abstract: We report a bosonic anomaly emerging in the quantum harmonic oscillator, whose partition function is rigorously identified as the Chern character via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, establishing a new connection among statistical mechanics, anomaly, Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Gromov-Witten theory. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physical sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime by using Grothentic-Riemann-Roch theorem. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete non-SUSY manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly. Furthermore, we arrive at Gromov-Witten theory through a more direct and physically intuitive approach. As a result, the internal energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator serves as a bridge linking two key concepts in physics -- statistical mechanics and anomalies -- with three fundamental mathematical frameworks: the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, and Gromov-Witten theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the strong graded locality of all unitary minimal W-algebras, so that they give rise to irreducible graded-local conformal nets. Among these unitary vertex superalgebras, up to taking tensor products with free fermion vertex superalgebras, there are the unitary Virasoro vertex algebras (N=0) and the unitary N=1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras. Accordingly, we have a uniform construction that gives, besides the already known N=0,1,2 super-Virasoro nets, also the new N=3,4 super-Virasoro nets. All strongly rational unitary minimal W-algebras give rise to previously known completely rational graded-local conformal nets and we conjecture that the converse is also true. We prove this conjecture for all unitary W-algebras corresponding to the N=0,1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: Theory and gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we analyze the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. Although removing any ambiguity in the dynamical tidal response would require a matching with some gauge-invariant coefficient, we assess the impact of these effects on the gravitational-wave phase. These contributions enter at eighth post-Newtonian order, and can be expressed in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Regardless of the matching ambiguities, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Local spin polarization by color-field correlators and momentum anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local spin polarization of quarks induced by color-field correlators stemming from the correlation of chromo-Lorentz force and chromo-magnetic polarization or chromo-spin Hall effect in the presence of momentum anisotropy. Such effects can trigger longitudinal polarization from fluctuating color fields in glasma or quark gluon plasma phases with transverse expansion for relativistic heavy ion collisions. Especially, from the glasma effect, the resulting longitudinal polarization spectrum of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons has a sinusoidal structure with twice the azimuthal angle relative to the anisotropic direction. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the effect aligns with experimental observations. Our findings highlight the significant role of coherent gluon fields as a novel source for spin polarization phenomena in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present precise theoretical results for the $ZH$ production cross section and invariant mass distribution at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) taking into account the effects of soft gluons.

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>On the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. Along the way, we prove the irreducibility criteria for the so-called ``induced modules'' of the BMS$_3$ algebra (which we prefer to call massive modules to avoid ambiguity) and show that this is the same criteria for the irreducibility of the Verma modules of the BMS$_3$ algebra. Interestingly, the modules generated by the action of the BCCA on the generating vector of the massive modules are also irreducible under the same criteria. When this criteria holds, every massive module decomposes into a direct sum of two BCCA-submodules, each of which we conjecture to be irreducible. Meanwhile, restricting Verma modules to the BCCA and $\mathcal{O}$ leads to free or ``almost free'' modules, which are not particularly interesting from a representation-theoretic viewpoint. This motivates the construction of BCCA modules intrinsically. To do this, we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra, using which we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</description>

      <title>Exact quasinormal modes in Grumiller spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grumiller metric is an effective model for gravity at large distances and plays a significant role in constructing galactic models and explaining dark matter. Here, in Grumiller spacetime, we analytically compute the quasinormal-mode frequencies and wave functions for massless particles with spin $\leq 2$ by introducing a new transformation relation. Our findings indicate that the quasinormal-mode frequencies are identical for different fermions with the same quantum number $n$. Notably, no bosonic quasinormal modes associated with Heun polynomials were found. Furthermore, for a given quasinormal-mode frequency, the corresponding particles exhibit a $2(n + 1)$-fold degeneracy. These results provide a theoretical basis for the mutual simulation of fermionic waves.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of \r{A} from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric higher-derivative models in quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum cosmology of supersymmetric, homogeneous and isotropic, higher derivative models. We recall superfield actions obtained in previous works and give classically equivalent actions leading to second order equations for the bosons, and first order for the fermions. Upon quantization, the algebra of fermions leads to a multi-component state, which is annihilated by the Hamiltonian and supersymmetric constraint operators. We obtain asymptotic wave functions of the oscillatory type, whose classical limit corresponds to inflationary evolution, and exact exponential wave functions. We use the latter to derive probability distributions of the initial curvature that are compatible with those obtained using the non-supersymmetric model.</description>
