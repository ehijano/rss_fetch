      <title>Acoustic Holography in the Megahertz Frequency Range with Optimal Lens Topologies and Nonlinear Acoustic Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic holography in the megahertz frequency range can impact numerous applications, including manufacturing, non-destructive testing, and transcranial ultrasound. However, designing lens topologies for complex acoustic holograms in the megahertz range poses a significant challenge, as weave propagation effects through the lens cannot be ignored. Here, we show that the inherent ability of heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to incorporate in plane varying speed-of-sound maps and support rapid differentiable optimization of lens thickness profiles can generate lens topologies for high fidelity acoustic holography. Crucially, we show that this framework can also account for wavefront aberrations in the propagation media, providing the opportunity to reconfigure this disruptive technology for high precision neuro-interventions. Our investigations also revealed that low frequency acoustic feedback generated by nonlinear mixing of high frequency waves allows attaining accurate skull-compensating lens alignment and creates the possibility to monitor CSF fluid build-up and removal in hydrocephalus. Together, our findings support the design of simple, economical, and high-performance ultrasound systems.</description>

      <title>Determining the acceleration field of a rigid body using three accelerometers and one gyroscope, with applications in mild traumatic brain injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often results from violent head motion or impact. Most prevention strategies explicitly or implicitly rely on motion- or deformation-based injury criteria, both of which require accurate measurements of head motion. We present an algorithm for reconstructing the full acceleration field of a rigid body from measurements obtained by three tri-axial accelerometers and one tri-axial gyroscope. Unlike traditional gyroscope-based methods, which require numerically differentiating noisy angular velocity data, or gyroscope-free methods, which may impose restrictive sensor placement or involve nonlinear optimization, the proposed algorithm recovers angular acceleration and translational acceleration by solving a set of linear equations derived from rigid body kinematics. In the proposed method, the only constraint on sensor placement is that the accelerometers must be non-collinear. We validated the algorithm in controlled soccer heading experiments, demonstrating accurate prediction of accelerations at unsensed locations across trials. The proposed algorithm provides a robust, flexible, and efficient tool for reconstructing rigid body motion, with direct applications in contact sports, robotics, and biomechanical injury prediction.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'erot quasinormal modes for topological edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological waveguides supporting quantum valley Hall interfacial states confine waves to interfaces and, due to topological protection, are resistant to backscattering even in the presence of defects. These topological insulators are typically studied by means of an infinite spectral problem. However, practical implementations are necessarily finite. In this work, we propose an alternative framework for analysing topologically non-trivial states in open, finite systems. Our approach is based on a Quasinormal Modal Expansion Method (QMEM), which directly characterizes the existence and excitation of these modes within the open system. The resulting spectrum is complex and discrete and fully describes the topologically non-trivial states, revealing an analogy of topological mode steering as a dispersive Fabry-P\'erot cavity, with a dispersion relation closely related to that of the corresponding infinite (Floquet-Bloch) ribbon problem. Our results illustrate how topologically protected waveguiding can be understood in terms of leaky cavity modes and offers a powerful framework for analysing finite topological devices.</description>

      <title>Optical discrimination of live single cancer cells using reflection-based nanohole array sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, a reflection-based nanohole array sensor system is presented for discriminating between migration-competent cancer cells that maintain the integrity of the actin cortex and those cells lacking the actin cortex and thus unable to migrate. Unlike previous transmission-based approaches, this configuration allows for more practical integration into in situ diagnostic tools. For the first time, the system performance is analyzed by studying the spectral features of the reflected light by live single cells. We demonstrate that the presence of the actin cortex, needed for cell migration, in different types of cancer cells significantly affect their optical response, enabling high sensitivity and specificity in cell classification. Our results pave the way for reflection-based plasmonic biosensor devices as a compact and efficient platform for developing biomedical application tools.</description>

      <title>Digital generation of the 3-D pore architecture of isotropic membranes using 2-D cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in imaging porous membranes is its inability to resolve three-dimensional pore architecture and interconnectivity, which are critical factors governing membrane performance. Although conventional tomographic 3-D reconstruction techniques can address this limitation, they are often expensive, technically challenging, and not widely accessible. We previously introduced a proof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a single 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those obtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to replicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In this study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction algorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore size distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies. Applying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated a high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties. Validation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in structural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution in resolving fine pore features. The tool can be readily applied to isotropic porous membrane structures of any pore size, as long as those pores can be visualized by SEM. Further work is needed for 3-D structure generation of anisotropic membranes.</description>

      <title>Engineering snags for spatial curvature in weaves: Fabrication, mechanics, and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags', a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar &amp; hinge model to simulate the mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows, respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.</description>

      <title>Observation and Control of Chiral Spin Frustration in BiYIG Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral interactions within magnetic layers stabilize the formation of noncollinear spin textures, which can be leveraged to design devices with tailored magnetization dynamics. Here, we introduce chiral spin frustration in which energetically degenerate magnetic states frustrate the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We demonstrate magnon-driven switching of the chirally frustrated spin states in Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin films. These states are defined by an in-plane macrospin neighboring two out-ofplane spins on either side with opposing chirality. Using scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry and spin pumping, we identified four degenerate frustrated states and achieved their controllable switching via magnon spin torque. Crucially, the switching is unidirectional, with selectivity determined by the incoming magnon direction. This mechanism provides a powerful approach to manipulate frustrated spin states with magnons. Chiral spin frustration unlocks the geometry constraints of conventional frustration, and therefore opens new horizons for frustrated magnetism, paving the way for energy-efficient spintronic devices based on frustratio</description>

      <title>Grain Boundaries in Ceramic Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that grain boundaries play a critical role in the performance and reliability of solid-state batteries with lithium metal anodes. Understanding and controlling grain boundaries is essential for enabling safe, high-rate operation of solid-state batteries. This review explores the multifaceted influence of grain boundaries in ceramic solid electrolytes and metal anodes, including their impact on ionic and electronic transport, dendrite and void formation, connecting them to the failure mechanisms. We discuss the formation and structure of space charge layers at grain boundaries, their role in modulating local defect chemistry, and the conditions under which grain boundaries may serve as fast-ion pathways or as vulnerable sites for failure. We highlight key differences in the grain boundaries of different classes of solid electrolytes and advances in modeling, experimental characterization, and processing techniques to understand the complexity and engineer grain boundaries in solid electrolytes. Finally, we outline key open questions and opportunities for grain boundary engineering to stimulate further progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Arctic dual-channel sound speed profile based on random airgun signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the unique dual-channel sound speed profiles of the Canadian Basin and the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic, based on the propagation characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles, an inversion method using refracted normal modes for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. This method proposes a dual-parameter representation method for dual-channel sound speed profiles, tailored to the characteristics of dual-channel sound speed profiles. A dispersion structure extraction method is proposed for the dispersion structure characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles. Combining the parameter representation method of sound speed profiles and the dispersion structure extraction method, an inversion method for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. For the common horizontal variation of sound speed profiles in long-distance acoustic propagation, a method for inverting horizontally varying dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. Finally, this article verifies the effectiveness of the dual-channel sound speed profile inversion method using the Arctic low-frequency long-range acoustic propagation experiment. Compared with previous sound speed profile inversion methods, the method proposed in this article has the advantages of fewer inversion parameters and faster inversion speed. It can be implemented using only a single hydrophone passively receiving random air gun signals, and it also solves the inversion problem of horizontal variation of sound speed profiles. It has significant advantages such as low cost, easy deployment, and fast computation speed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic source depth estimation method based on a single hydrophone in Arctic underwater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the normal mode and ray theory, this article discusses the characteristics of surface sound source and reception at the surface layer, and explores depth estimation methods based on normal modes and rays, and proposes a depth estimation method based on the upper limit of modal frequency. Data verification is conducted to discuss the applicability and limitations of different methods. For the surface refracted normal mode waveguide, modes can be separated through warping transformation. Based on the characteristics of normal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source depth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the receiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray trajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time difference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field patterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Locked Kerr Microcombs for Flexible On-Chip Optical Clock Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks deliver unrivaled precision, yet their size and complexity still confine them to specialized laboratories. Frequency combs provide the crucial optical-to-microwave division needed for clock readout, but conventional fiber- or bulk-laser combs are far too large for portable use. The advent of chip-integrated microcombs, frequency combs generated in micron-scale resonators, has revolutionized this landscape, enabling fully miniaturized, low-power clocks that bridge optical and radio-frequency domains on a single chip. Nevertheless, stabilizing a microcomb solely through pump laser control entangles otherwise independent feedback parameters, injects extra technical noise, and prevents flexible partial division of the optical frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a universal on-chip optical-clock architecture that supports both partial and full optical division. A hybrid passive-active scheme enables locking any two microcomb teeth independently, eliminating cross-coupling of control loops. Using the pump laser as a nonlinear actuator to stabilize an arbitrary tooth, we achieve a residual relative frequency instability of 1e-16. This advance brings integrated optical clocks closer to real-world deployment and opens new avenues for precision timing and navigation.</description>

      <title>Breakdown and polarization contrasts in ferroelectric devices observed by operando laser-based photoemission electron microscopy with the AC/DC electrical characterization system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an operando laser-based photoemission electron microscope (laser-PEEM) with a ferroelectric characterization system. A Sawyer-Tower circuit was implemented to measure the polarization-voltage ($P-V$) characteristics of ferroelectric devices. Using this system, we successfully obtained the well-defined $P-V$ hysteresis loops for a ferroelectric capacitor incorporating Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO), reproducing the typical field-cycling characteristics of HZO capacitors. After dielectric breakdown caused by field-cycling stress, we visualized a conduction filament through the top electrode without any destructive processing. Additionally, we successfully observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results indicate that our operando laser-PEEM system is a powerful tool for visualizing conduction filaments after dielectric breakdown, the ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distribution of materials implemented in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Gradient Electronic Landscapes in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.</description>

      <title>Straintronics across Lieb-Kagome interconversion and variable transport scaling exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant metal-insulator transition and crossover between strongly correlated line-graph lattices (Lieb and Kagome). Using a non-perturbative numerical approach, we demonstrate for the first time that an applied shear strain stabilizes a metallic phase cradled in between a gapped magnetic insulator and a gapless flat band localized insulator, facilitating the Lieb/Kagome interconversion. Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared integrated resonators on a III-V platform with Q-factors beyond half a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate mid-IR integrated race-track resonators on a III-V semiconductor platform,InGaAs core epitaxially grown on InP. We have performed a complete characterization of the optical propagation losses at wavelength = 4.6 um and wavelength = 8.5 um, two representative wavelengths for the 1st and 2nd atmospheric transparency windows. We measured losses of 1 dB/cm (TE polarization) and 1.3 dB/cm (TM polarization) at 8.5 um. Substantially lower losses, 0.28 dB/cm, were measured at wavelength = 4.6 um (TM polarization). We then implemented racetrack resonators with straight evanescent couplers. We obtained loaded quality factors larger than 600.000 at wavelength = 4.6 um. These results are promising towards the development of non-linear mid-IR integrated devices with Q factors beyond a million, where the onset of stimulated parametric processes could be reachable.</description>

      <title>Tunable edge and depth sensing via phase-change nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performing simultaneous depth-of-field (DoF) extension and edge enhancement within a single optical element remains a fundamental challenge in advanced imaging. Here, we propose a wavelength-tunable nonlocal Huygens' metasurface capable of simultaneously extracting depth and edge features of images in a single-shot exposure. Using the selective polarization response of the Huygens' metasurfaces, the circularly polarized converted component undergoes geometric phase modulation for wavefront shaping to extend the DoF, while the non-converted component acts as a spatial frequency filter to enhance edge contrast. The integration of a phase-change material, Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$, enables continuous tuning of the resonance wavelength across a range of 100 nm by modulating its refractive index, granting the system excellent broadband spectral adaptability. This work offers a novel and compact solution for real-time depth sensing and feature extraction in applications such as autonomous navigation and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</description>

      <title>Topological resonance behaviors of surface acoustic waves under a surface liquid-layer loading and sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, topological resonance behaviors of surface acoustic waves (SAW) under a surface liquid-layer loading are investigated. By revealing influences of the liquid-layer loading on wave velocity of SAW and topological indices (Berry curvature and Chern number) of topological interface-modes, a topological resonance peak with a high Q-factor is obtained based on couplings of a topological interface-mode waveguide and a resonant cavity under a surface liquid-layer loading. The results show that the degree of spatial-inversion-symmetry breaking resulting from structure parameters has an obvious influences on the topological resonance Q-factor, while the influences of the thickness of the liquid-layer loading on that is weak. It is worth noting that the topological resonance frequency is significantly sensitive to the liquid parameters. Based on that, a novel topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor is proposed. Furthermore, sensing performances of this kind of sensor are simulated, which are used to sensing the concentration of hemoglobin, albumin, NaCl and NaI in aqueous solutions, and high sensitivities and Q-factors are obtained. The results presented in this paper can provide an important basis for the realization of highly sensitive and stable SAW micro-liquid-sample biomedical sensors in the future.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Linear Stress Waves in Layered Media: I. Non-Hermitian Degeneracies and Modal Chirality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the band structure and scattering of in-plane coupled longitudinal and shear stress waves in linear layered media and observe that exceptional points (EP) appear for elastic (lossless) media, when parameterized with real-valued frequency and tangential wave vector component. The occurrence of these EP pairs is not limited to the original stop bands. They could also appear in all mode pass bands, leading to the formation of new stop bands. The scattered energy near these locations is studied along with the associated polarization patterns. The broken phase symmetry is observed inside the frequency bands book-ended by these EP pairs. This is especially manifested by the chirality of the trajectory of the particle velocity, which gets selected by a ``direction'' of the wave, e.g. the imaginary part of normal component of the wave vector, or the energy flux direction just outside the band. Additionally, EP pairs also appear in the spectrum of the (modified) scattering matrix when mechanical gain is theoretically included to balance the loss in a parity-time symmetric finite structure. These EP pairs lead to amplification of transmission to above 1 and single-sided reflectivity, both phenomena associated with broken phase symmetry, with intriguing potential applications.</description>

Abstract: The precise engineering of electromagnetic couplings is paramount for constructing scalable and highfidelity superconducting quantum processors. While essential for orchestrating qubit operations, these couplings also present significant design challenges, including the mitigation of crosstalk and the management of environmental decoherence. A clear and unified theoretical framework is therefore crucial for the design, simulation, and analysis of these complex quantum circuits. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the fundamental electromagnetic coupling mechanisms in superconducting devices. Starting from first principles, we formulate the equations of motion and derive the input-output relations for canonical systems, including a single resonator coupled to a multi-port microwave network, interacting resonators, and coupled transmission lines. We review rigorous definitions for key parameters such as the energy decay rate (\k{appa}) and the dimensionless coupling coefficient ({\zeta}) and connect these formalisms to practical methods of parameter extraction from electromagnetic simulations. This work provides a rigorous and pedagogical foundation for understanding and modeling linear electromagnetic interactions, serving as a vital resource for the development of advanced superconducting quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Overprinting with Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod, taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED, we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water, allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM. This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality.</description>
