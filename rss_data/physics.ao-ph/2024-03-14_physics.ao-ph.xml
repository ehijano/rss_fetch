      <title>On the Stochasticity of Aerosol-Cloud Interactions within a Data-driven Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) pose the largest uncertainty for climate projections. Among many challenges of understanding ACI, the question of whether ACI is deterministic or stochastic has not been explicitly formulated and asked. Here we attempt to answer this question by predicting cloud droplet number concentration Nc from aerosol number concentration Na and ambient conditions. We use aerosol properties, vertical velocity fluctuation w', and meteorological states (temperature T and water vapor mixing ratio q_v) from the ACTIVATE field observations (2020 to 2022) as predictor variables to estimate Nc. We show that the climatological Nc can be successfully predicted using a machine learning model despite the strongly nonlinear and multi-scale nature of ACI. However, the observation-trained machine learning model fails to predict Nc in individual cases while it successfully predicts Nc of randomly selected data points that cover a broad spatiotemporal scale, suggesting the stochastic nature of ACI at fine spatiotemporal scales.</description>

      <title>Applying ranking techniques for estimating influence of Earth variables on temperature forecast error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes how to analyze the influence of Earth system variables on the errors when providing temperature forecasts. The initial framework to get the data has been based on previous research work, which resulted in a very interesting discovery. However, the aforementioned study only worked on individual correlations of the variables with respect to the error. This research work is going to re-use the main ideas but introduce three main novelties: (1) applying a data science approach by a few representative locations; (2) taking advantage of the rankings created by Spearman correlation but enriching them with other metrics looking for a more robust ranking of the variables; (3) evaluation of the methodology by learning random forest models for regression with the distinct experimental variations. The main contribution is the framework that shows how to convert correlations into rankings and combine them into an aggregate ranking. We have carried out experiments on five chosen locations to analyze the behavior of this ranking-based methodology. The results show that the specific performance is dependent on the location and season, which is expected, and that this selection technique works properly with Random Forest models but can also improve simpler regression models such as Bayesian Ridge. This work also contributes with an extensive analysis of the results. We can conclude that this selection based on the top-k ranked variables seems promising for this real problem, and it could also be applied in other domains.</description>

      <title>Learning Closed-form Equations for Subgrid-scale Closures from High-fidelity Data: Promises and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in discovering interpretable, closed-form equations for subgrid-scale (SGS) closures/parameterizations of complex processes in Earth systems. Here, we apply a common equation-discovery technique with expansive libraries to learn closures from filtered direct numerical simulations of 2D turbulence and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Across common filters (e.g., Gaussian, box), we robustly discover closures of the same form for momentum and heat fluxes. These closures depend on nonlinear combinations of gradients of filtered variables, with constants that are independent of the fluid/flow properties and only depend on filter type/size. We show that these closures are the nonlinear gradient model (NGM), which is derivable analytically using Taylor-series. Indeed, we suggest that with common (physics-free) equation-discovery algorithms, for many common systems/physics, discovered closures are consistent with the leading term of the Taylor-series (except when cutoff filters are used). Like previous studies, we find that large-eddy simulations with NGM closures are unstable, despite significant similarities between the true and NGM-predicted fluxes (correlations $&gt; 0.95$). We identify two shortcomings as reasons for these instabilities: in 2D, NGM produces zero kinetic energy transfer between resolved and subgrid scales, lacking both diffusion and backscattering. In RBC, potential energy backscattering is poorly predicted. Moreover, we show that SGS fluxes diagnosed from data, presumed the ''truth'' for discovery, depend on filtering procedures and are not unique. Accordingly, to learn accurate, stable closures in future work, we propose several ideas around using physics-informed libraries, loss functions, and metrics. These findings are relevant to closure modeling of any multi-scale system.</description>
