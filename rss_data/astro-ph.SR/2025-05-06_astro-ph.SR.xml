      <title>Carbon from massive binary-stripped stars over cosmic time: effect of metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of carbon in the Universe remains uncertain. At solar metallicity, binary-stripped massive stars -- stars that lost their envelope through stable interaction with a companion -- have been suggested to produce twice as much carbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across a range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the carbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and binary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses ($10$-$46,M_\odot$), metallicities ($Z = 0.0021$, $0.0047$, $0.0142$), and initial orbital periods ($10$-$5000$ days). We find that metallicity is the dominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the effects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields from binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that yields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to lower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below $1/7$ solar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon yields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars. This suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the presence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed in high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our findings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of other outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and accretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full understanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>A Wide-band High-frequency Type-II Solar Radio Burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II radio bursts are typically observed below ~ 400 MHz, with narrow-band slowly-drifting fundamental and harmonic structures. Here we report an unusual high-frequency wide-band type-II burst with starting frequency as high as 600 - 700 MHz and the instantaneous bandwidth being as wide as ~ 300 MHz. The estimated average spectral drift is ~ 2.18 MHz/s, its mean duration at each frequency is ~ 3 min, the maximum brightness temperature can exceed 10^11 to 10^12 K. According to the simultaneous EUV and radio imaging data, the radio sources distribute over a relatively broad region that concentrates around a dip of the nose front of the shock-like EUV wave structure. The dip is likely caused by the strong interaction of the eruption with the overlying closed dense loops that are enclosed by the large-scale streamer structure, indicating that the Type-II burst originates from such CME-shock interaction with dense-closed loop structures. The observations suggest that the unusual wide-band high frequency type-II radio burst originates from a dense streamer region in the corona, supported by EUV shock-like structure that get steepened very close to the solar surface ~ 1.23 R0 and type-II radio source coincides with the shock dip. Further the wide-band feature is due to the source stemming from a region with large density variation and not due to the intensity variation across the shock structure.</description>

      <title>Very massive stars at low metallicity: evolution, synthetic spectroscopy, and impact on the integrated light of starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect on the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two frameworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z dependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute evolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and 0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along the evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including VMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions regarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all their lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z VMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS display HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they become too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population synthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is also sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include a Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts, especially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these stars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces more ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends on age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short phases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to produce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under specific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and sometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However we are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Interaction between Ion-Scale Waves and Ion Velocity Distributions in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent in situ observations from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) near perihelia reveal ion beams, temperature anisotropies, and kinetic wave activity. These features are likely linked to solar wind heating and acceleration. During PSP Encounter 17 (at $11.4R_s$) on Sep-26-2023, the PSP/FIELDS instrument detected enhanced ion-scale wave activity associated with deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium in ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) observed by the PSP/Solar Probe Analyzers-Ion (SPAN-I). Dense beams (secondary populations) were present in the proton VDFs during this wave activity. Using bi-Maxwellian fits to the proton VDFs, we found that the density of the proton beam population increased during the wave activity and, unexpectedly, surpassed the core population at certain intervals. Interestingly, the wave power was reduced during the intervals when the beam population density exceeded the core density. The drift velocity of the beams decreases from 0.9 to 0.7 of the Alfv\'{e}n speed and the proton core shows a higher temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel&gt;2.5$) during these intervals. We conclude that the observations during these intervals are consistent with a reconnection event during a heliospheric current sheet crossing. During this event, $\alpha$ particle parameters (density, velocity, and temperature anisotropy) remained nearly constant. Using linear analysis, we examined how the proton beam drives instability or wave dissipation. Furthermore, We investigated the nonlinear evolution of ion kinetic instabilities using hybrid kinetic simulations. This study provides direct clues about energy transfer between particles and waves in the young solar wind.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of Ellerman bombs using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ellerman bombs (EBs) are observable signatures of photospheric small-scale magnetic reconnection events. The reliable automatic detection of EBs would enable the study of the impact of magnetic reconnection on the Sun's dynamics. We aim to develop a method to automatically detect EBs in H$\alpha$ observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and in SDO/AIA observations using the 1600\r{A}, 1700\r{A}, 171\r{A} and 304\r{A} passbands. We trained models based on neural networks (NNs) to perform automatic detection of EBs. Additionally, we used different types of NNs to study how different properties contribute to the detection of EBs. We find that for SST observations, the NN-based models are proficient at detecting EBs. With sufficiently high spectral resolution, the spatial context is not required to detect EBs. However, as we degrade the spectral and spatial resolution, the spatial information becomes more important. Models that include both dimensions perform best. For SDO/AIA, the models struggle to reliably distinguish between EBs and bright patches of different origin. Permutation feature importance revealed that the H$\alpha$ line wings (around $\pm$1 \r{A} from line center) are the most informative features for EB detection. For the SDO/AIA case, the 1600\r{A} channel is the most relevant one when used in combination with 171\r{A} and 304\r{A}. The combination of the four different SDO/AIA passbands is not informative enough to accurately classify EBs. From our analysis of a few sample SDO/AIA 1600\r{A} and 1700\r{A} light curves, we conclude that inclusion of the temporal variation may be a significant step towards establishing an effective EB detection method that can be applied to the extensive SDO/AIA database of observations.

      <title>Exploring Contact Binaries: Observational Analysis of four W Uma Binaries Using Photometry and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the multi-band photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic analysis of four W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries (EWs) - J080510.1+141528 (hereinafter as J0805a), J080516.3+143138 (hereinafter as J0805b), J143358.7+053953 (hereinafter as J1433), and J143458.4+054143 (hereinafter as J1434). The multi-band ground based photometric data are collected using the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) while we also make use of TESS photometric observations. The spectroscopic analysis is based on the low-resolution observations by 4-m Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). The ephemeris of these systems are updated using the photometric data from TESS and other photometric surveys. The system J0805b shows a secular change in the orbital period with a period change rate of 4.2 ($\pm$ 0.1) $\times10^{-7}$ days per year while the orbital period change rate for J1433 is calculated as -1.1 ($\pm$ 0.1) $\times10^{-6}$ days per year. The mass-transfer rate for J0805b is found to be dM$_{1}$/dt = -1.56($\pm$0.07) $\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/year and dM$_{1}$/dt = -7.95($\pm$0.87) $\times 10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$/year for J1433. All the systems have inclination &gt; 79$^{\circ}$ except J1433 which has inclination of 72.8$^{\circ}$. The mass-ratios (less massive to more massive component) for these targets are &lt; 0.5. All the system except J0805b are A-subtype contact binaries. The absolute parameters of the systems are determined using GAIA DR3 parallax and reddening information. The LAMOST spectra are analyzed using spectral subtraction technique. A small excess emission is detected for J1433 in H$_{\alpha}$ and H$_{\beta}$ region. The systems are plotted on Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and compared with previously studied systems. The mass-ratio vs radius-ratio relation is also investigated for these systems.</description>

      <title>It's not just a phase: oblique pulsations in magnetic red giants and other stochastic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a significant role in stellar evolution. In the last few years, asteroseismology has enabled the measurement of strong magnetic fields $10^4$--$10^6\,\mathrm{G}$ in the cores of dozens of red giants, and is the only known way to directly measure internal stellar magnetic fields. However, current data are still interpreted assuming that these fields are too weak or too axisymmetric to affect the orientation of the pulsations (i.e., make the pulsations ``oblique''), rendering stronger field strengths beyond the reach of existing asteroseismic searches. We show that, even when an oblique pulsator is also stochastic (such as in a red giant with a strong non-axisymmetric magnetic field), geometric effects will cause the signal to contain frequency components which remain in perfect relative phase with each other. This perfect phase relationship persists even over timescales in which stochasticity erases absolute phase information. This perfect relative coherence is a distinctive observational signature of oblique pulsation that does not require a model for mode frequencies to search for. However, due to its dependence on phase, this effect will not be evident in the power spectral density alone, and phase information should be retained in order to detect it. Coherence-based searches for oblique pulsations may pave the way to measurements of magnetic fields of currently inaccessible strengths in red giants, as well as some main-sequence and compact pulsators.</description>

      <title>Solar Coronal Heating: Role of Kinetic and Inertial Alfv\'en Waves in Heating and Charged Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of solar coronal heating and charged particle acceleration remains one of the most critical challenges in space and astrophysical plasma physics. In this study, we explore the contribution of Alfv\'en waves, both in their kinetic (KAWs) and inertial (IAWs) regimes, to particle acceleration processes that ultimately lead to coronal heating. Using a kinetic plasma framework based on the generalized Vlasov-Maxwell model, we analyze the dynamics of these waves with a focus on the perpendicular components of the Poynting flux vectors and the net resonance speed of the particles.
  Our results show that both the magnitude and dissipation rate of the Poynting flux for KAWs and IAWs decrease with increasing electron-to-ion temperature ratio (T_e/T_i) and normalized perpendicular electron inertial length (c k_x / omega_pe). We evaluate the associated electric potentials and find that KAWs are significantly influenced in the high wavenumber (k_x rho_i) regime. IAWs, on the other hand, show a decrease in electric potential along the magnetic field and an increase across it when the perpendicular electric field (E_x) is enhanced. We also determine the net resonant speeds of particles in the perpendicular direction and show that these wave-particle interactions can efficiently heat the solar corona over large distances (R_Sun). Finally, we quantify the power transported by KAWs and IAWs through solar flux loop tubes, finding that both wave types deliver greater energy with increasing T_e/T_i and c k_x / omega_pe. These findings offer deeper insights into wave-driven heating and are relevant to solar wind and magnetospheric physics.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Forecast: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Solar Flare Class Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are among the most powerful and dynamic events in the solar system, resulting from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere. These energetic bursts of electromagnetic radiation can release up to 10^32 erg of energy, impacting space weather and posing risks to technological infrastructure and therefore require accurate forecasting of solar flare occurrences and intensities. This study evaluates the predictive performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying solar flares into 4 categories (B, C, M, X). Using the dataset of 13 SHARP parameters, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated in binary and multiclass classification tasks. The analysis utilized 8 principal components (PC), capturing 95% of data variance, and 100 PCs, capturing 97.5% of variance. Our approach uniquely combines binary and multiclass classification with different levels of dimensionality reduction, an innovative methodology not previously explored in the context of solar flare prediction. Employing a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning ensured robust model evaluation. Our findings indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance across all metrics, benefiting significantly from increased dimensionality. The insights of this study enhance future research by optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques and informing model selection for astrophysical tasks. By integrating this newly acquired knowledge into future research, more accurate space weather forecasting systems can be developed, along with a deeper understanding of solar physics.</description>

      <title>Response of the solar atmosphere to flux emergence: With emergence-driven prominence formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux emergence is crucial for the formation of solar active regions and triggering of various eruptions. However, the detailed mechanisms by which flux emergence drives these eruptions remain unclear and require numerical investigation. Using 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the interaction between emerging flux and background magnetic fields and dynamics of the induced eruptions. By systematically varying the strength and angle of the emerging magnetic field relative to the background field, we investigate its impact on the initiation and evolution of solar eruptions. The simulations show that magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux and background field drives the formation of current sheets, magnetic islands and multithermal jets. Stronger magnetic fields result in earlier eruptions, more energetic jets, and enhanced heating. The formation and ejection of magnetic islands affect the structure and dynamics of the jet. When the hot and cool components of jets reach the other footpoint of magnetic loops, they will generate spicules near the transition region. Varying the angle between the emerging flux and the background field, we find that larger angles delay filament ascent and eruption timing but facilitate filament formation. Filaments form a hot shell and oscillate with a period of 10 minutes driven by periodic plasma ejections. Repetitive reconnection events inject cold plasma into the self-consistently formed filament channel, introducing a new prominence formation mechanism by flux-emergence-fed injection. Our analysis highlights the dynamic interplay between magnetic reconnection, plasma cooling and heating, and filament dynamics. These findings provide insights into solar eruptions and their observational signatures, emphasizing the role of multi-thermal structures in the corona.</description>

      <title>Discovery of resonating integration modes in triple-mode high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars: a new evolutionary phase indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars (HADS) that pulsate in their first three radial modes are rare in current samples. Here, we analyse five such triple-mode HADS observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and report that the previously considered second overtone mode ($f_2$) is actually the non-radial component of a resonating integration mode (RI mode, resulting from resonance between a radial p-mode and a non-radial p-g mixed mode), which shows significant amplitude and frequency variations over short timescales (approximately 20 days). This RI mode appears to be widespread among these stars. Notably, all five stars are in the post-main sequence evolutionary phase, actively crossing the Hertzsprung gap. These stars offer valuable insights into stellar evolution during the Hertzsprung gap, which is one of the most rapid evolutionary stages in a star's life.</description>

      <title>Extreme-ultraviolet transient brightenings in the quiet-Sun corona : Closest-perihelion observations with Solar Orbiter/EUI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings identified by Solar Orbiter, commonly known as campfires, are the smallest transient brightenings detected to date outside active regions in the solar corona. We investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of a large ensemble of the finest-scale EUV transient brightenings observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter. We perform a statistical analysis of the EUV brightenings by using quiet-Sun observations at the highest possible spatial resolution ever obtained by EUI. We use observations in the 17.4 nm passband of the High Resolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI acquired during the closest perihelia of Solar Orbiter in 2022 and 2023. Solar Orbiter being at a distance 0.293 AU from the Sun, these observations have an exceptionally high image scale of 105 km, recorded at a fast cadence of 3 seconds. We use a wavelet-based automatic detection algorithm to detect and characterise the events of interest, and study their morphological and photometrical properties. We report the detection of smallest and shortest lived EUV brightenings to date in the quiet-Sun. The size and lifetime of the detected EUV brightenings appear power-law distributed down to a size of 0.01 Mm$^{2}$ and a lifetime of 3 seconds. In general their sizes lie in the range of 0.01 Mm$^{2}$ to 50 Mm$^{2}$ , and their lifetimes vary between 3 seconds and 40 minutes. We find an increasingly high number of EUV brightenings at smaller spatial and temporal scales. We estimate that about 3600 EUV brightenings appear per second on the whole Sun. The HRIEUV brightenings thus represent the most prevalent, localised and finest-scale transient EUV brightenings in the quiet regions of the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Upper Scorpius OB association with HERMES. I. The spectroscopic sample and 6D kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify &gt;1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.</description>

      <title>Early Shock-Cooling Observations and Progenitor Constraints of Type IIb SN 2024uwq</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission phase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad H-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar strengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha decreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35 $M_\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock cooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a partially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\odot$, consistent with a blue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\odot$ , likely stripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position between compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of binary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope progenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical observations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the diversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain surveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and UVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early signatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their explosive endpoints.</description>

      <title>Stellar wind parameters of massive stars in accretion-powered High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of mass-exchange between the components of High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) systems with neutron stars undergoing wind-fed accretion is discussed. The X-ray luminosity of these systems allows us to evaluate the mass capture rate by the neutron star from the stellar wind of its massive companion and set limits on the relative velocity between the neutron star and the wind. We find that the upper limit to the wind velocity in the orbital plane during the high state of the X-ray source is in the range 120--1000 km/s, which is by a factor of 2--4 lower than both the terminal wind velocity and the speed of the wind flowing out from the polar regions of massive stars for all the objects under investigation. This finding is valid not only for the systems with Be stars, but also for those system in which the optical components do not exhibit the Be phenomenon. We also show that the lower limit to the radial wind velocity in these systems can unlikely be smaller than a few per cent of the orbital velocity of the neutron star. This provide us with a new constraint on the mass-transfer process in the outflowing disks of Be-type stars.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Age of Milky Way Globular Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) provide statistically significant coeval populations of stars spanning various evolutionary stages, allowing robust constraints on stellar evolution model parameters and ages. We analyze eight old Milky Way GCs with metallicities between [Fe/H] $=-2.31$ and $-0.77$ by comparing theoretical isochrone sets from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program to HST observations. The theoretical isochrones include uncertainties introduced by $21$ stellar evolution parameters such as convective mixing, opacity, diffusion, and nuclear reactions, capturing much of the quantifiable physics used in our code. For each isochrone, we construct synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) near the main-sequence turn-off region and apply two full-CMD-fitting methods to fit HST ACS data across a range of distance and reddening and measure the absolute age of each GC from the resulting posterior distribution, which accounts for uncertainties in the stellar models, observations, and fitting method. The resulting best-fitting absolute ages range from $\approx 11.5$ to $13.5$ Gyr, with a typical error of $0.5-0.75$ Gyr; the data show a clear trend toward older ages at lower metallicities. Notably, distance and reddening account for over $50\%$ of the uncertainty in age determination in each case, with metallicity, $\alpha$ abundance, mixing length, and helium diffusion being the most important stellar physics parameters for the error budget. We also provide an absolute age-metallicity relation for Milky Way GCs.</description>

      <title>The Disks In Scorpius-Centaurus Survey (DISCS) I: Four Newly-Resolved Debris Disks in Polarized Intensity Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of infrared excesses around stars directly correlates to spatially-resolved imaging detections of circumstellar disks at both mm and optical/near-infrared wavelengths. High contrast imagers have resolved dozens of circumstellar disks with scattered light polarimetric imaging. Many of these detections are members of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, demonstrating it to be a rich sample for investigating planetary system architectures and planet-disk interactions. With the goal of expanding the sample of directly imaged debris disks in Scorpius-Centaurus, we conducted the Disks In Scorpius-Centaurus Survey (DISCS) leveraging knowledge of high-IR excesses and the power of high contrast polarimetric differential imaging. In combination with the GPIES polarimetric disk survey, we observe seven new Scorpius-Centaurus targets to achieve a 60% complete survey of debris disks with IR excesses exceeding $2.5\times10^{-4}$, resolving four new debris disks. HD 98363, HD 109832, and HD 146181 are resolved for the first time, and HD 112810 is resolved for the first time in polarized intensity. We identify morphological structures that may be indications of planet-disk interactions. We place the systems in the greater context of resolved debris disks, identifying factors of ten differences in scattered light contrast for a given IR excess and implying gaps in our understanding of the smallest and largest dust grains of a system. We conclude that while thermal emission measurements are correlated with scattered light detection, they poorly predict the magnitude of scattered light brightness. We also establish Scorpius-Centaurus debris disks as critical benchmarks in understanding the properties of disks in the scattering regime.</description>

      <title>Alien-Type-Ia supernovae from the Milky Way merger history and one possible candidate -- Kepler's supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way is a dynamic and evolving system shaped by numerous merger events throughout its history. These mergers bring stars with kinematic and dynamic properties differing from the main stellar population. However, it remains uncertain whether any of the Galactic supernova remnants can be attributed to such a merger origin.In this work, we compare the progenitor of Kepler's supernova to its nearby stars, ``alien'' stars, and in-situ Milky Way stellar populations. We uncover the abnormal kinematics and dynamics of Kepler's supernova and propose that its progenitor may have an extragalactic origin. We call the SNe Ia produced by stars accreted into the Milky Way through merger events ``Alien-Type-Ia supernovae'' (Alien-SNe-Ia) since they are cosmic immigrants. We estimate the rate of Alien-SNe-Ia exploded recently, using two methods: through galactic chemical evolution (using GalCEM), and through a method without considering exact star formation history, introduced for the first time in this paper. We consider the past accretion of a few major satellite galaxies -- Kraken, Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage, Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, Wukong/LMS-1, and Cetus -- assuming these were dry mergers. The first method yields $1.5\times 10^{-5} - 5.0\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, while the second method yields a comparable ${3.1}^{+1.8}_{-{1.1}}\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ as the rate estimates for recent Alien-SNe-Ia. These estimates represent lower bounds because we assumed no post-merger star formation.</description>

      <title>Identification of BHB stars using Synthetic SkyMapper colors from Gaia XP spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are ideal tracers for mapping the structure of Galactic stellar halo. Traditionally, BHB sample stars are built from large-scale spectroscopic surveys utilizing their spectral features, however, the resulting sample sizes have been quite limited. In this paper, we construct a catalog of BHB stars based on synthetic colors $(u-v)_{0}$ and $(g-i)_{0}$ in SkyMapper photometric systems, which are convolved from Gaia XP spectra. A total of 49,733 BHB stars are selected from nearly the entire sky (excluding regions of low Galactic latitudes $|b| \le 8^{\circ}$ with heavy reddening), with a completeness and purity exceeding 90\%. Using member stars of globular clusters with precise distance determinations, we carefully calibrate the relationship between the $g$-band absolute magnitude and $(g-i)_{0}$, achieving a precision of 0.11\,mag, which corresponds to a 5\% uncertainty in distance. This relation is applied to derive distances for all BHB stars in the constructed sample. Given current capabilities of Gaia XP observations, the constructed BHB sample is primarily located within 20 kpc, enabling detailed mapping of the inner stellar halo. To extend this depth to the outer halo or even the edge of our Galaxy, we explore the potential of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and its broad-band photometry for detecting BHB stars. Using mock data from synthetic spectra, we find that it is feasible to distinguish BHB stars from blue stragglers (BS) stars using CSST near-ultraviolet bands ($NUV, u$) photometry. Thanks to the deep limiting magnitude of CSST, its data will provide a groundbreaking perspective on our Galaxy, particularly regarding the outer halo, in an unprecedented volume.</description>

      <title>The Tip of Red Giant Branch Distances to Nearby Dwarf Galaxies WLM and Sextans A with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distance measurements to extragalactic systems that are both accurate and precise are cornerstones of modern astrophysics, underpinning the calibration of standard candles and the determination of the Hubble constant. Dwarf galaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable laboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations. In this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute magnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of $\mu_{\mathrm{0,WLM}} = 24.977 \pm 0.018 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.056 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for WLM and $\mu_{\mathrm{0,SexA}} = 25.740 \pm 0.011 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.057 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for Sextans A. Our results are consistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on TRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With improved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the potential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to reduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.</description>

      <title>Massive Acquisition of Ultraviolet Color Excess Information from GALEX and UVOT Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs stellar parameters from spectroscopic surveys and Zhang et al. based on Gaia XP spectra, along with photometric data from GALEX, UVOT, and Gaia, to obtain extensive ultraviolet color excess information for the relevant bands of GALEX and UVOT. By considering the impact of stellar parameters (\teff, \feh, and \logg) on intrinsic color indices, and utilizing the blue-edge method combined with a random forest algorithm, an empirical relationship between stellar parameters and intrinsic ultraviolet color indices is established. By combining observed color indices, the study derives color excesses for 11,624,802 and 65,531 stars in the GALEX/near-UV and far-UV bands, and 336,633, 137,739, and 253,271 stars in the UVOT/\uvwa, \uvmb, and \uvwb\ bands, constructing corresponding ultraviolet extinction maps. Notably, the color excess data for the GALEX/near-UV band shows a tenfold increase from previous results, with the extinction map covering approximately two-thirds of the sky at a resolution of 0.4$^{\circ}$. The typical uncertainties in the ultraviolet color excesses are 0.21 mag, 0.30 mag, 0.19 mag, 0.24 mag, and 0.21 mag for \enb, \efb, \ewab, \embb, and \ewbb, respectively. By comparing the spatial distributions of \rv\ derived from ultraviolet and Gaia optical band measurements with those obtained from infrared and optical data in previous works, it is evident that the \rv\ distributions based on the ultraviolet data show noticeable differences, with some regions even exhibiting opposite trends. This suggests that a single-parameter \rv\ extinction law may not be sufficient to simultaneously characterize the extinction behavior across infrared, optical, and ultraviolet bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

Abstract: WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence on the angular momentum of the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transfer of a star's angular momentum to its atmosphere is a topic of considerable and wide-ranging interest in astrophysics. This letter considers the effect of kinetic and magnetic turbulence on the solar wind's angular momentum. The effects are quantified in a theoretical framework that employs Reynolds-averaged mean field magnetohydrodynamics, allowing for fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude. The model is restricted to the solar equatorial (\(r-\phi\)) plane with axial symmetry, which permits the effect of turbulence to be expressed in analytical form as a modification to the classic Weber &amp; Davis (1967) theory, dependent on the \(r,\phi\) shear component of the Reynolds stress tensor. A solar wind simulation with turbulence transport modeling and Parker Solar Probe observations at the Alfv\'en surface are employed to quantify this turbulent modification to the solar wind's angular momentum, which is found to be ~ 3% - 10% and tends to be negative. Implications for solar and stellar rotational evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Great Wave: Evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation propagating outwards in the Galactic disc</title>

Abstract: We analyse the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of two samples of young stars in the Galactic disc, containing respectively young giants ($\sim$17$\, $000 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$7 kpc) and classical Cepheids ($\sim$3400 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$15 kpc). The vertical structure of the two samples exhibit a consistent shape of the Milky Way's warp, whose amplitude reaches $\sim$700 pc at a Galactocentric radius R $\sim$ 14 kpc. Moreover, both samples show evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation on top of the warp with a vertical height of $\sim$150-200 pc, extending over a large portion of the Galactic disc between Galactocentric radii $R \sim$ 10-12 kpc in the third Galactic quadrant (galactic longitudes $180^\circ &lt; l &lt; 270^\circ$) and $\sim$12-14 kpc in the second Galactic quadrant ($90^\circ &lt; l &lt; 180^\circ$). Its total length is at least 10 kpc and can possibly reach $\sim$ 20 kpc with the Cepheid sample. The stars in the corrugation exhibit both radial and vertical systematic motions, with Galactocentric radial velocities towards the outer disc of about 10-15 km/s. In the vertical motions, once the warp signature is subtracted, the residuals show a large-scale feature of systematically positive vertical velocities, which is shifted to slightly larger Galactocentric radii with respect to the spatial vertical corrugation (with a phase difference of roughly $\pi/2$), indicating an oscillatory behaviour. A comparison of the observed shift with a simple toy model suggests that the corrugation can be interpreted as a wave propagating towards the outer disc. The wave mapped in this work is located at larger heliocentric distances compared to the Radcliffe wave, a $\sim$2.7 kpc filament of dense gas clouds close to the Sun, and exhibits a larger coverage of the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 24$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 92$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &lt;= z &lt;= 3.61 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437--4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437--4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437--4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437--4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Earths composition: origin, evolution and energy budget</title>

Abstract: One in every two atoms in the Earth, Mars, and the Moon is oxygen; it is the third most abundant element in the solar system. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets are different from those of the Sun and demonstrate that these planets are not direct compositional analogs of the solar photosphere. Likewise, the Suns O/Fe, Fe/Mg and Mg/Si values are distinct from those of inner solar system chondrites and terrestrial planets. These four elements (O, Fe, Mg, Si) make up about 94% by mass of the rocky planets and their abundances are determined uniquely using geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical constraints. The rocky planets grew rapidly from planetesimals, most of which were differentiated, having a core and a mantle, before being accreted. Planetary growth in the early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution was rapid and was only partially recorded by the meteoritic record. The noncarbonaceous meteorites (NC) provide insights into the early history of the inner solar system and are used to construct a framework for how the rocky planets were assembled. NC chondrites have chondrule ages that are two to three million years younger than t_zero (the age of calcium-aluminum inclusions, CAI), documenting that chondrites are middle- to late-stage products of solar system evolution. The composition of the Earth, its current form of mantle convection, and the amount of radiogenic power that drives its engine remain controversial topics. Earths dynamics are driven by primordial and radiogenic heat sources. Measurement of the Earths geoneutrino flux defines its radiogenic power and restricts its bulk composition. Using the latest data from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments affirms that the Earth has 20 TW of radiogenic power and sets the proportions of refractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth at 2.5 to 2.7 times that in CI chondrites.</description>
