      <title>Ensuring continued operation of INSPIRE as a cornerstone of the HEP information infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The INSPIRE platform -- the most widely-used discovery service specifically tailored to the needs of researchers in High Energy Physics (HEP) -- has become a central component of the information infrastructure for the discipline. Despite this, INSPIRE's continued sustainability is frequently endangered by resource constraints, recently made more acute by the loss of support from historical funders changing their research priorities. If the European particle physics community wishes to ensure INSPIRE's long-term sustainability, the community should secure international support and ensure appropriate funding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine toponium formation effects in top-antitop pair production at the LHC, focusing on the near-threshold region where non-relativistic corrections are relevant. We discuss their modelling using non-relativistic QCD Green's functions, and show that predictions reproduce features expected from bound-state dynamics, in contrast to pseudo-scalar toy models.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-six baryon-number-violating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): the baryon-number-violating sector at dimension six in the power counting. We obtain the results in two different schemes: in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations; and in naive dimensional regularization, which in the considered sector of the theory does not lead to any ill-defined $\gamma_5$-odd traces. Our results are of interest for a reanalysis of the constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model from proton-decay searches within an EFT framework at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for Collective Neutrino Instability: Fast, Slow, and Mixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities in collective neutrino oscillations can lead to sizeable flavor conversion with vital astrophysical consequences. While it is now recognized that the initial phase space distributions of the different flavors determine the existence and character of instabilities, a rigorous instability condition for generic distributions -- that depend on both energy and emission angles -- is lacking. In this work we identify, analyze, and explain the conditions that are sufficient (and necessary) for a generic collective neutrino flavor instability.</description>

      <title>Pseudorapidity density, transverse momentum spectra, and elliptic flow studies in Xe-Xe collision systems at $\rm{\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44 TeV}$ using the HYDJET++ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic study of Xe--Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.44$~TeV center-of-mass energy. We employ the Monte Carlo (hydrodynamics plus jets) HYDJET++ model to calculate the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra, and the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of charged hadrons with different parameters in two geometrical configurations: body-body and tip-tip types of Xe--Xe collisions. The kinematic ranges $0 &lt; p_{\mathrm{T}} &lt; 50~\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ are considered in our study. Results are obtained for seven classes of centrality. For comparison, we have shown results from the AMPT model with the string-melting version. The results obtained for Xe--Xe collision systems for minimum bias at midrapidity match well with the experimental data from the ALICE and CMS Collaborations. We observe that the pseudorapidity density depends on the size and geometry of the colliding system. The centrality dependence of average transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\mathrm{T}} \rangle$) and average elliptic flow ($\langle v_2 \rangle$) is also observed. The charged hadron properties also show clear dependence on the geometrical configuration of the collisions. Our model results have been compared to results obtained from the AMPT model. The HYDJET++ model matches the experimental data more closely than the AMPT model, which tends to overpredict the data.</description>

      <title>Higher-order anisotropic flow correlations in Xe-Xe collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 5.44 TeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model (HYDrodynamics plus JETs), we produce anisotropic harmonic flow coefficients $v_n$ ($n = 4$-$7$) in deformed Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44~\mathrm{TeV}$. These harmonics are measured with respect to a plane constructed using the lower-order Fourier harmonics $v_2$ and $v_3$, produced using the reaction plane method. The cross-talk between elliptic and triangular flows in the model generates both even and odd higher-order harmonics. By combining analyses of higher harmonics with those of $v_2$ and $v_3$, one can eliminate uncertainties in modeling anisotropic flow from initial conditions and define quantities that involve only nonlinear hydrodynamic response coefficients. In this context, we study the individual response of higher-order flow coefficients to the lower-order ones through a power-law scaling technique of the form $v_n / v_m^m$, as a function of collision centrality. We report that the higher-order flow coefficients $v_n$ ($n = 4$-$7$) exhibit strong centrality dependence and are significantly correlated with the elliptic and triangular flow. The results are compared with data from recent ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS experiments at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Asymmetric Dark Matter Self Annihilation Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the relic density for asymmetric dark matter incorporating self annihilation processes in both the shear-dominated universe and Gauss-Bonnet braneworld. Under the same conditions where the ratio of final asymmetry to the initial asymmetry $ R \equiv \Delta_{-\infty}/\Delta_{\text{in}} $ is identical, the shear-dominated universe, due to its enhanced Hubble expansion rate, leads to an earlier freeze-out point of wash-out asymmetry process and allows a higher upper limit on the self annihilation cross section. Conversely, the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld, with a weakened Hubble expansion rate, delays the freeze-out point and permits a lower upper limit on the self annihilation cross section. We further constrain the wino mass $M_2$ for sneutrino and higgsino asymmetric dark matter in both scenarios, showing that, compared to the standard model, the lower limit of $M_2$ is smaller in the shear-dominated universe but higher in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld.</description>

      <title>Study of $B\to \pi \rho$, $\pi \omega$ decays in the modified perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $B\to\pi\rho$ and $\pi\omega$ decay processes using the modified perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. Sudakov factors arising from the resummation of the double logarithms for the contributions of the transverse momenta of partons can increase the applicability of perturbative calculations. In this work we find that infrared contributions cannot be fully suppressed by Sudakov factors alone when the $B$ meson wave function obtained by solving the wave equation in the QCD-inspired relativistic potential model is used in the calculation of $B$ decays. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a soft cutoff scale $\mu_c$ to separate the hard and soft contributions. Color-octet contributions for the intermediate quark-antiquark pairs are considered. Such contributions are crucial to deminish the discrepancies between the theoretical calculation and experiemntal data. Using the isospin symmetry, we do find the optimal parameter space for the nonperturbative inputs, which can result in excellent agreement between the theoretical calculation and experimental data of $B\to\pi\rho$ and $B\to\pi\omega$ decays.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-jet correlations in charged-current SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged-current deep inelastic scattering plays a significant role in determining parton distribution functions with flavour separation. In this work, we present a systematic calculation of the charged-current semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in the $eN$ collinear frame up to twist-3 level at leading order. Semi-inclusive refers to the process in which a jet is detected in addition to the scattered neutrino. We focus on neutrino-jet correlations in our calculation. We first present the differential cross section in terms of structure functions, followed by the differential cross section expressed in term of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions. We derive the complete set of azimuthal asymmetries and intrinsic asymmetries. We also introduce an observable $A^C$, defined as the ratio of the difference to the sum of differential cross sections for electron and positron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We notice that $A^C$ not only provides a sensitive probe for valence quark distribution functions but also can reveal the violation of strange-antistrange symmetry.</description>

      <title>Role of $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ baryons in decay $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, based on Belle data, we investigate the structure around 1435 MeV and the role of the $\Sigma(1380)$ resonance in the decay process $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^+$. The $\Lambda \pi^\pm$ invariant mass spectra are approximately reproduced by the contribution from the $\Sigma(1385)$, modeled as a Breit-Wigner resonance combined with background terms. However, an additional component is required to account for the pronounced enhancement near 1435 MeV. To describe this structure, we consider two scenarios for the $\Sigma(1435)$: one as a Breit-Wigner resonance with spin-parity $1/2^-$ described via effective Lagrangians, and the other as a rescattering effect arising from coupled-channel interactions. The rescattering contributions are evaluated using the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Simulated invariant mass spectra are generated and fitted to the experimental data. Both the Breit-Wigner and rescattering mechanisms provide reasonable descriptions of the enhancement near 1435 MeV, with the Breit-Wigner scenario yielding a slightly better $\chi^2$. However, the rescattering approach naturally generates a cusp-like structure near threshold, which closely resembles the feature observed in the data. Furthermore, the inclusion of the $\Sigma(1380)$ resonance with spin-parity $1/2^-$ significantly improves the fit in the low-energy region and further enhances the description near 1435 MeV through interference effects. These results underscore the essential roles of the two $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ states in accurately describing the invariant mass distributions in the decay $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$.</description>

      <title>An exact parametrization of minimal seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a parametrization of neutrino masses and mixing in the minimal seesaw model (MSM). The MSM, which introduces two heavy sterile neutrinos, is the minimal extension of the Standard Model in addressing the tiny masses of active neutrinos. The parametrization includes 11 free parameters: 6 neutrino oscillation parameters (2 mass-squared differences $\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$, 3 mixing angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$, and 1 Dirac phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$), 1 mass parameter in $0\nu2\beta$ decay $m_{ee}$, and 4 additional parameters: 2 heavy neutrino masses $M_1$ and $M_2$, 1 active-sterile mixing angle $\theta_{14}$ and 1 CP-violating phase $\delta_{14}$. This parametrization is derived exactly from the most general neutrino mass matrix in the MSM without any approximation. We further discuss its implications in phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Examining scalar portal inelastic dark matter with lepton fixed target experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inelastic dark matter (DM) scenarios have attracted considerable attention in contemporary particles physics. In this study, we investigate the phenomenology of sub-GeV inelastic dark matter scenarios mediated by a lepton-specific scalar portal. By solving Boltzmann equations, we obtain a thermal target curves for the set of inelastic DM mass splitting in the sub-GeV mediator mass range. We study the discovery potential of lepton fixed-target experiments, particularly NA64e and NA64$\mu$, through their missing-energy signatures. Our analysis focuses on the $\phi$-strahlung process, $l N \to l N \phi$, followed by the invisible decay of the scalar mediator into Majorana dark matter particles $\phi \to \chi_1 \chi_2$, as a probe of the mediator coupling with charged leptons of Standard Model. For the viable parameters of the inelastic dark matter scenario, we derive the sensitivity projections for NA64e and NA64$\mu$, implying that boosted state $\chi_2$ decays visibly $\chi_2 \to \chi_1 e^+ e^-$ beyond the detector acceptance. Our results demonstrate the complementary roles of electron- and muon-beam experiments in exploring the sub-GeV inelastic dark matter sector mediated by the scalar portal.</description>

      <title>Probing millicharged particles with NA64$\mu$ and LDMX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millicharged particles emerge as compelling candidates in numerous theoretically well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. These hypothetical particles, characterized by an electric charge that is a small fraction of the elementary charge, have attracted significant attention in contemporary experimental physics. Their potential existence motivates dedicated search strategies across multiple experimental platforms, leveraging their distinctive electromagnetic interactions while evading conventional detection methods. In the present paper we estimated the projected sensitivity of fixed-target experiments - specifically NA64$\mu$ and LDMX - to the parameter space of millicharged particles. For the NA64$\mu$ experiment, with an anticipated muon flux of $\mbox{MOT}\simeq 10^{14}$, our analysis reveals a detectable mass window of $10~\mbox{MeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 150~\mbox{MeV}$ and charge parameter range $10^{-4} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 7\times 10^{-4}$. This sensitivity arises from the bremsstrahlung-like missing energy signature $\mu N \to \mu N \gamma^{*}( \to \chi \bar{\chi})$. Furthermore, we evaluate the discovery potential of the LDMX facility, considering its projected electron beam statistics ($\mbox{EOT}\simeq 2\times 10^{16}$) and energy ($E_{\rm e}\simeq 8~\mbox{GeV}$). Our results demonstrate that LDMX can probe heavier MCPs in the mass range $250~\mbox{MeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 400 ~\mbox{MeV}$, with sensitivities reaching $10^{-3} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$. This parametric window can be accessible through the distinctive invisible decay channel $\rho \to \chi \bar{\chi}$, where $\rho$-meson photo-production $\gamma N \to N \rho$ plays a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>The ratio of $\gamma / \pi^0$ production rates in neutrino-nucleus interactions at the $\Delta$ resonance mass region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dependence of neutrino-induced {\gamma}/$\pi^0$ production ($\stackrel{ {(-)}}{\nu_\mu} + A \to \stackrel{ {(-)}}{\nu_\mu}(\mu) +\gamma/\pi^0 + X$) on the target nucleus A, at the $\Delta$ resonance mass region. Our conclusion is based on experimental data for $\pi^0$ production rates at photon-nucleus interactions from the A2 collaboration at the Mainz MAMI accelerator. We assume that $\Delta$ resonance decays are independent of the production mechanism (via photon, Z, or W boson). In Neutral Current (NC) interactions, the $1\pi^0 + X$ production scales as A$^{2/3}$, reflecting the nuclear surface area. In contrast, photons from $\Delta$ decays typically escape the nucleus, resulting in a cross-section proportional to the atomic number A. Thus, in NC interactions, the ratio of {\gamma} production to $\pi^0$ production is proportional to A$^{1/3}$. In Charged Current (CC) $\nu_\mu$($\bar \nu_\mu$) -induced production of $\Delta^+$ ($\Delta^0$) will be proportional to the number of neutrons (protons) in the nucleus. After $\Delta$ decay, due to the charge universality in strong interactions, the suppression factor for $\pi^0$ escaping the nucleus must also follow A$^{-1/3}$, as in NC interactions. We predict the ratio of the ${\gamma} / \pi^0$ production rates in NC and CC interactions and for $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar \nu_\mu$ beams:
  Argon target: ~3.1% (NC/CC $\nu_\mu/\bar \nu_\mu$)
  Water target: ~1.9% (NC), ~2.3% (CC $\nu_\mu$), ~1.7% (CC $\bar \nu_\mu$)
  Liquid Scintillator target: ~1.7% (NC), ~2.1% (CC $\nu_\mu$), ~1.6% (CC $\bar \nu_\mu$)
  We also discuss solving the MiniBooNE anomaly by looking at the CC single photon and single neutral pion production rates at the SBN program experiments at Fermilab.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to double prompt $J/{\psi}$ hadroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic-QCD (NRQCD) factorization, we perform a comprehensive investigation of the color singlet (CS) contribution to prompt $J/\psi$ pair production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at next-to-leading order (NLO) in $\alpha_s$. Specifically, we compare our NLO predictions with measurements from the LHCb, CMS, and ATLAS Collaborations. We find that the CS contribution itself can well describe the LHCb data in most of the experimental bins, except in the regions where the fixed-order calculation is spoiled by the emission of soft or hard-collinear gluons. In the CMS and ATLAS cases, however, the CS predictions greatly undershoot both the measured total and differential cross sections, despite sizable $K$ factors, of 2--3, for the total cross sections.</description>

      <title>Normal mode analysis within relativistic massive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the normal mode analysis on the linearized Boltzmann equation for massive particles in the relaxation time approximation. One intriguing feature of massive transport is the coupling of the secular equations between the sound and heat channels. This coupling vanishes as the mass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis, we determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset transition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless systems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of each mode under various values of the scaled mass. Within the range of scaled masses considered, the critical wavenumbers for the heat and shear channels decrease with increasing scaled mass, while that of the sound channel exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the scaled mass. In addition, we analytically derive the dispersion relations for these collective modes in the long-wavelength limit. Notably, kinetic theory also incorporates collisionless dissipation effects, known as Landau damping. We find that the branch cut structure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the massless case: whereas the massless system features only two branch points, the massive system exhibits an infinite number of such points forming a continuous branch cut.</description>

      <title>Portal Matter Models of Kinetic Mixing with Two Light Dark Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing (KM) portal mandates the existence of at least one new gauge boson, the dark photon (DP) based on the group $U(1)_D$, which mixes with the Standard Model (SM) photon via loops of other new heavy particles carrying both SM and dark charges called portal matter (PM). Arguments exist based on the RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling suggesting that at higher scales $U(1)_D$ becomes part of a more complex non-Abelian group, a simple example being just the SM-like $G_D=SU(2)_I \times U(1)_{Y_I}$. In our past analyses it was always assumed that $G_D$ broke in a SM-like manner directly to the DP's $U(1)_D$ which then subsequently broke at low energies $\lsim 1$ GeV. However, this need not be the case and $G_D$ can instead break to $U(1)_{T_{3I}}\times U(1)_{Y_I}$, with $T_{3I}$ being the diagonal generator of $SU(2)_I$, now producing two light gauge bosons which obtain masses at the $\lsim 1$ GeV scale. In this paper we will explore the phenomenology of a very simple realization of this kind of alternative setup employing non-abelian KM and having a minimal, lepton-like PM sector, demonstrating its distinctive nature in comparison to the previously examined symmetry breaking path. The effects of interference between these gauge bosons on thermal dark matter annihilation, the production of new heavy gauge, Higgs and PM states at colliders, as well as the corresponding signatures for the light dark gauge bosons are examined.</description>

      <title>Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Improve the Sensitivity of Higgs Pair Searches in the $4b$ Channel at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs self-coupling is crucial for understanding the structure of the scalar potential and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. In this work, utilizing deep neural network based on Particle Transformer that relies on attention mechanism, we present a comprehensive analysis of the measurement of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling through the Higgs pair production with subsequent decay into four $b$-quarks ($HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$) at the LHC. The model processes full event-level information as input, bypassing explicit jet pairing and can serves as an event classifier. At HL-LHC, our approach constrains the $\kappa_\lambda$ to $(-0.53,6.01)$ at 68\% CL achieving over 40\% improvement in precision over conventional cut-based analyses. Comparison against alternative machine learning architectures also shows the outstanding performance of the Transformer-based model, which is mainly due to its ability to capture the correlations in the high-dimensional collision data with the help of attention mechanism. The result highlights the potential of attention-based networks in collider phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the next-to-leading order corrections to single inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering at small $x$ using the color glass condensate formalism, for the case when the exchanged photon is transversely polarized. We show all UV and soft divergences cancel while collinear and rapidity divergences result in scale evolution of quark-hadron fragmentation function and small-x evolution of dipole amplitudes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reconstruction of the Critical Line in the QCD Phase Diagram from Imaginary to Real Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test a technique adopted in the lattice simulations framework, to reconstruct the chiral-phase boundary at real chemical potential, $\mu$, via extrapolation from imaginary $\mu$. We use a low-energy effective model, the Quark-Meson model, both in the mean-field approximation and within the Functional Renormalization Group, the latter in the Local Potential Approximation. The model provides results both for real and imaginary values of $\mu$, thus a direct comparison can be performed between the prediction of the model for real values of $\mu$ and the ones obtained via extrapolation from the results at imaginary $\mu$. We compute an effective convergence radius for the reconstruction technique, $\mu_\mathrm{conv}$, and find $\mu_\mathrm{conv}\approx146$ MeV. This value sustains the validity of the reconstruction technique also for finite and moderate values of the chemical potential. On the other hand, within our model, $\mu_\mathrm{conv}$ is quite smaller then the value of $\mu$ where we find the actual critical endpoint. Near this point of the phase diagram, we find a discrepancy between the actual phase boundary and the one pbtained via extrapolatin of $\approx150\%$. Therefore, our results show that the location of the critical endpoint obtained via reconstruction from imaginary $\mu$ should be considered with due caution</description>

      <title>Testing Thermal-Relic Dark Matter with a Dark Photon Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent DAMIC-M results, we present the status of thermal-relic dark matter $\chi$ coupled to a kinetically-mixed dark photon $A^\prime$. In the predictive "direct annihilation" regime, $m_{A'} &gt; m_\chi$, the relic abundance depends on the kinetic mixing parameter, and there is a minimum value compatible with thermal freeze out. Using only electron and nuclear recoil direct detection results, we find that for complex scalar dark matter, the direct-annihilation regime is now excluded for nearly all values of $m_\chi$; the only exception is the resonant annihilation regime where $m_{A'}\approx 2 m_\chi$. Direct annihilation relic targets for other representative models, including Majorana and Pseudo-Dirac candidates, remain viable across a wide range of model parameters, but will be tested with a combination of dedicated accelerator searches in the near future. In the opposite "secluded annihilation" regime, where $m_\chi &gt; m_{A'}$, this scenario is excluded by cosmic microwave background measurements for all $m_\chi \lesssim 30$ GeV. Similar conclusions in both the direct and secluded regimes hold for all anomaly-free vector mediators that couple to the first generation of electrically-charged Standard Model particles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 2.5$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering on Quantum Computers via Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework using Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) for simulating real-time scattering processes in $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Unlike traditional lattice discretisation methods, HT approximates the quantum field theory Hilbert space by truncating the energy eigenbasis of a solvable reference Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of required qubits. Our approach involves preparing initial states as wavepackets through adiabatic evolution from the free-field theory to the interacting regime. We experimentally demonstrate this state preparation procedure on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum device and validate it through quantum simulations, capturing key phenomena such as wavepacket dynamics, interference effects, and particle production post-collision. Detailed resource comparisons highlight the advantages of HT over lattice approaches in terms of qubit efficiency, although we observe challenges associated with circuit depth scaling. Our findings suggest that Hamiltonian Truncation offers a promising strategy for quantum simulations of quantum field theories, particularly as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve.</description>

Abstract: We derive a Perturbation Theory (PT) for the Lorentz boost operator in the space of two-nucleon wave functions. The latter is expressed in terms of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials, developed so far in great detail for their use in the NN scattering studies. The PT is designed to take into account the boost relativistic corrections in a systematic way and, as such, it is the only missing part in the corresponding approaches developed up to now in the low-energy effective field theories (EFT).</description>

      <title>Towards nucleon structure function moments and parton momentum fractions from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the lowest even isovector moment of the $F_2$ structure function in $2+1$-flavour lattice QCD with varying quark masses corresponding to $m_\pi \approx [410, 360, 300] \; {\rm MeV}$, at a fixed volume of $V = 48^3 \times 96$ and coupling $\beta = 5.65$ ($a = 0.068(3) \, {\rm fm}$). We directly compute the physical Compton amplitude using the Feynman-Hellmann approach and extract moments of the physical structure function. We report on the quark-mass dependence of the lowest isovector moment and estimate its value at the physical quark-mass point with $\sim 10\%$ uncertainty at fixed $Q^2$. By analysing the $Q^2$ dependence of the moments at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point ($m_\pi \approx 410 \; {\rm MeV}$), we separate the leading- and higher-twist contributions and estimate the parton momentum fraction, $\langle x \rangle_{u-d}$, which agrees with existing results.</description>

      <title>Orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy of an inner-shell orbital clock transition in neutral ytterbium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inner-shell orbital clock transition $^1S_0 \leftrightarrow 4f^{13}5d6s^2 \: (J=2)$ in neutral ytterbium atoms has attracted much attention as a new optical frequency standard as well as a highly sensitive probe to several new physics phenomena, such as ultra-light dark matter, violation of local Lorentz invariance, and a new Yukawa potential between electrons and neutrons. Here, we demonstrate almost two-orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy over the previous reports by trapping atoms in a three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattice. In particular, we successfully observe the coherent Rabi oscillation, the relaxation dynamics of the excited state, and the interorbital Feshbach resonance. To highlight the high precision of our spectroscopy, we carry out precise isotope shift measurements between five stable bosonic isotopes well below 10 Hz uncertainties, successfully setting bounds for a hypothetical boson mediating a force between electrons and neutrons. These results open up the way for various new physics search experiments and a wide range of applications to quantum science with this clock transition.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity Method for Evaluating Scattering Amplitudes within the Worldline Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The worldline formalism offers an alternative framework to the standard diagrammatic approach in quantum field theory, grounded in first-quantized relativistic path integrals. Over recent decades, this formalism has attracted growing interest due to its potential applications and computational advantages. As a result, a collection of worldline master integrals has been derived within this approach. However, efficient mathematical tools for evaluating these integrals remain limited.
  Motivated by unitarity methods used in the conventional formalism of quantum field theory, this work proposes a novel framework for evaluating one-loop worldline master integrals, up to a rational function in the kinematical external invariants, through the computation of their discontinuities. Similarly to standard unitarity techniques, the method involves decomposing an $n$-point one loop amplitude in $D=4$ dimensions into a linear combination of tadpole, bubble, triangle, and box master integrals. The coefficients of this decomposition are rational functions of the external kinematic invariants. Each master integral exhibits a characteristic discontinuity with respect to a specific kinematic invariant. Consequently, the rational coefficients can be determined by directly computing the discontinuities of the corresponding worldline master integrals. In the three-point and four-point on-shell cases, this computation is particularly tractable, as the discontinuities involve Dirac delta functions arising from the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula, which simplify the resulting integrals.
  For the four-point on-shell case, a set of master formulas for the discontinuities is derived. The practical implementation of the proposed discontinuity method is demonstrated through several illustrative examples.</description>

Abstract: Jet quenching serves as a key probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. This proceedings presents recent results from RHIC and LHC on jet energy loss, acoplanarity, and the flavour and path-length dependence of Parton energy loss, providing critical constraints on QGP properties and theoretical models. Upcoming data taking campaigns at RHIC and the LHC will offer enhanced precision and extended kinematic reach to further advance our understanding of jet-medium interactions.</description>

Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings without scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2]. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the GW signal, future interferometers can probe $m_Q$ and $f_a$ complementing the sensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant parameter that describe the physics. Specifically, we find that BBO and ET GW detectors will both be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Improved Predictions on Higgs-Starobinsky Inflation and Reheating with ACT DR6 and Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of recent CMB observations for Higgs-Starobinsky inflationary models and their associated reheating dynamics, utilizing data from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. In addition to direct CMB constraints, we incorporate indirect bounds arising from the potential overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly through limits on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). These constraints become especially relevant in scenarios featuring a stiff post-inflationary equation of state $w_{\rm RH}\geq 0.58$. Our analysis shows that, when both P-ACT-LB-BK18 data and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds are considered, the viable number of inflationary e-folds is restricted to the range ($57.9$-$62.2$) at the $2\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). Correspondingly, the reheating temperature is constrained to lie between the BBN energy scale and $10^{12}$ GeV, with the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter satisfying $w_{\rm RH} &gt; 0.41$. However, no parameter space remains viable at the $1\sigma$ C.L. once $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraints from PGWs are included, rendering the Higgs-Starobinsky model highly restricted.</description>

      <title>First Observations of Solar Halo Gamma Rays Over a Full Solar Cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</description>

Abstract: Generalized-unitarity calculations of two-loop amplitudes are performed by expanding the amplitude in a basis of master integrals and then determining the coefficients by taking a number of generalized cuts. In this paper, we present a complete classification of the solutions to the maximal cut of integrals with the double-box topology. The ideas presented here are expected to be relevant for all two-loop topologies as well. We find that these maximal-cut solutions are naturally associated with Riemann surfaces whose topology is determined by the number of states at the vertices of the double-box graph. In the case of four massless external momenta we find that, once the geometry of these Riemann surfaces is properly understood, there are uniquely defined master contours producing the coefficients of the double-box integrals in the basis decomposition of the two-loop amplitude. This is in perfect analogy with the situation in one-loop generalized unitarity.
  In addition, we point out that the chiral integrals recently introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. can be used as master integrals for the double-box contributions to the two-loop amplitudes in any gauge theory. The infrared finiteness of these integrals allow for their coefficients as well as their integrated expressions to be evaluated in strictly four dimensions, providing significant technical simplification. We evaluate these integrals at four points and obtain remarkably compact results.</description>

      <title>Discovery Prospects for the Light Charged Higgs Boson Decay to an Off-Shell Top Quark and a Bottom Quark at Future High-Energy Colliders</title>

Abstract: The charged Higgs boson ($H^\pm$) with a mass below the top quark mass remains a viable possibility within the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model under current constraints. While previous LHC searches have primarily focused on the $H^\pm\to\tau^\pm\nu$ decay mode, the decay channel into an off-shell top quark and a bottom quark, $H^\pm \rightarrow t^*b$, is leading or subleading for $H^\pm$ masses between 130 and 170 GeV. This study investigates the discovery potential of future colliders for this off-shell decay mode through pair-produced charged Higgs bosons decaying via $H^+H^-\rightarrow t^*b\tau\nu\rightarrow bbjj\tau\nu$. We perform signal-to-background analyses at the HL-LHC and a prospective 100 TeV proton-proton collider, employing cut-flow strategies and the Boosted Decision Tree method. However, due to the softness of the $b$ jets, signal significances fall below detection thresholds at these facilities. Extending our study to a multi-TeV muon collider (MuC), we demonstrate that a 3 TeV MuC achieves high signal significance, surpassing the $5\sigma$ threshold with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$ and a 10\% background uncertainty. Specifically, for $M_{H^\pm} = 130$, 150, and 170 GeV, the significances are 13.7, 13.5, and 6.06, respectively. In contrast, a 10 TeV MuC requires 10 ab$^{-1}$ to achieve similar results. Our findings highlight the critical role of the MuC in probing the new signal channel $H^\pm\rightarrow t^*b$, offering a promising avenue for future charged Higgs boson searches involving off-shell top quarks.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Gravitational Atoms</title>

Abstract: We propose a scenario of primordial gravitational atoms (PGAs), which may exist in the current and past universe due to spinning primordial black holes (PBHs) and very light bosonic fields. In a monochromatic mass scenario with a sizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD) era, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\propto f^3$ followed by a falling $\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we investigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs with a core mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim {\cal O}(10)~M_{\odot}$ and a cloud of light scalar with mass $\mu \sim {\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even stronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and TianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the $(\mu,M_{\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum spin, $10^{-8}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 10^4~M_{\odot}$, $10^{-16}~{\rm eV}\lesssim \mu\lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed with a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be probed.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos play a crucial role in particle physics, but cannot be tracked in collider experiments. If more than one neutrino is present in a collision event, it is impossible to extract neutrinos' information using any of the traditional methods. In this Letter, we introduce an innovative inclusive-tagging scheme that is capable of capturing the four-momentum of an undetected particle on the signal side, such as a neutrino, $K_L^0$, etc., in collider experiments. This is the first proposed solution to the longstanding challenge outlined above. Our scheme, based on an asymptotically recursive vector sequence, has the potential to catalyze a significant transformation in the reconstruction techniques for (semi-)leptonic decays of collider experiments. The application and development of this scheme will greatly improve the precision of measurements of Standard Model parameters in the (semi-)leptonic sector with the same data samples, and could play a pivotal role in the search for new physics. Additionally, the asymptotically recursive (vector) sequence introduced in our scheme might also have promising applications in other fields, such as machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model of Particle Physics as an effective theory from two non-universal $U(1)$'s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of obtaining the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics as an effective theory of a more fundamental one, whose electroweak sector includes two non-universal local $U(1)$ gauge groups, with the chiral anomaly cancellation taking place through an interplay among families. As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, a massive gauge boson $Z'$ arises, which couples differently to the third family of fermions (by assumption, we restrict ourselves to the scenario in which the $Z'$ couples in the same way to the first two families). Two Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet are necessary to generate the SM fermion masses and break the gauge symmetries. We show that in our model, the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of the Higgs sector are identically zero if each right-handed SM fermion is only coupled with a single Higgs doublet. This result represents a FCNC cancellation mechanism different from the usual procedure in Two-Higgs Doublet Models~(2HDM). The non-universal nature of our solutions requires the presence of three right-handed neutrino fields, one for each family. Our model generates all elements of the Dirac mass matrix for quarks and leptons, which is quite non-trivial for non-universal models. Thus, we can fit all the masses and mixing angles with two scalar doublets. Finally, we show the distribution of solutions for the scalar boson masses in our model by scanning well-motivated intervals for the model parameters. We consider two possibilities for the scalar potential and compare these results with the Higgs-like resonant signals recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. Finally, we also report collider, electroweak, and flavor constraints on the model parameters.</description>

Abstract: With the neutrino experiments advancing toward high-precision measurements and greater emphasis on reducing systematic uncertainties, improving the single-pion production models, a major component of the hadronic activity observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments, into the Monte Carlo simulations is crucial. This work presents the predictions of the struck nucleon's Fermi motion by analyzing the charged-current neutral pion production on carbon nucleus in MINER$\nu$A. A minimal variation of GENIE and NuWro based on their default models shows an improvement in the prediction of single $\pi^0$ production. The prediction describes the data more accurately in the higher-momentum tail; however, discrepancies between the predictions and data below the Fermi peak highlight the limitations in current nuclear models used in the Monte Carlo generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic (super)strings offer promising ways to test ideas about the early universe and physics at high energies. While in field theory constructions their tension is usually assumed to be constant (or at most slowly-varying), this is often not the case in the context of String Theory. Indeed, the tensions of both fundamental and field theory strings within a string compactification depend on the expectation values of the moduli, which in turn can vary with time. We discuss how the evolution of a cosmic string network changes with a time-dependent tension, both for long-strings and closed loops, by providing an appropriate generalisation of the Velocity One Scale (VOS) model and its implications. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, exhibiting novel features such as growing loops, percolation and a radiation-like behaviour of the long string network. We conclude with a few remarks on the impact for gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi_c'$ and $\Omega_c$ baryons at high temperature with chiral restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masses of the singly heavy baryons (SHBs), composed of a heavy quark and a light diquark, are studied from the viewpoints of heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS) and chiral-symmetry restoration at finite temperature. We consider the light diquarks with spin-parity $J^P=0^\pm$ and $1^\pm$. Medium corrections to the SHBs are provided through the diquarks whereas the heavy quark is simply regarded as a spectator. The chiral dynamics of the diquark are described by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model having (pseudo)scalar-type and (axial)vector-type four-point interactions and the six-point ones responsible for the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. The divergences are handled by means of the three-dimensional proper-time regularization with both ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs included, in order to eliminate unphysical imaginary parts. As a result, the mass degeneracies between the parity partners of all the SHBs are predicted in accordance with the chiral restoration. In particular, the HQS-doublet SHBs exhibit clear mass degeneracies due to the absence of the direct anomaly effects. We also predict a mass degeneracy of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Omega_c$ above the pseudocritical temperature $T_{\rm pc}$ of chiral restoration, which results in a peculiar mass hierarchy for positive-parity HQS-doublet SHBs where $\Xi_c'$ becomes heavier than $\Omega_c$ Besides, it is found that the decay width of $\Sigma_c\to\Lambda_c\pi$ vanishes above $T_{\rm pc}$ reflecting a closing of the threshold. The predicted modifications of masses and decay widths of the SHBs are expected to provide future heavy-ion collision experiments and lattice simulations with useful information on chiral dynamics of the diquarks.</description>

      <title>Form factors of light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic and meson-photon transition form factors (TFF) of light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. To comprehensively account for both the longitudinal and transverse nonperturbative dynamics of hadronic constituents, we incorpoarate intrinsic transverse momentum distributions (iTMDs) alongside the conventional light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The main motivations of this work are the disjointedness of electromagnetic form factors between the theoretical predictions and the experimental measurements, and the BaBar-Belle tension of pion-photon transition form factor in the large momentum transfers. Our calculation is carried out at the next-to-leading-order for the contributions from leading and subleading twist LCDAs, and leading order for the twist four contributions. Notably, this work presents the first systematic evaluation of higher-twist contributions to meson-photon TFFs. The key findings are: (a) iTMDs play a crucial role in describing form factor data, particularly in the small-to-intermediate momentum transfer region where they induce significant modifications to pQCD predictions. (b) The extracted transverse size parameters for valence quark states are found to be $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^{-2}$, the chiral mass of pion meson $m_0^\pi$ at $1$ GeV is determined to be $1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV. (c) The meson-photon TFFs are predominantly governed by leading-twist LCDAs. The iTMDs-enhanced pQCD results show better agreement with Belle's pion TFF data across intermediate and large momentum transfers and favor a small $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing angle. (d) Remarkably, the inclusion of iTMDs extends the applicability of pQCD calculations down to a few GeV$^2$ for all considered form factors, significantly improving the theory-data consistency.</description>

      <title>Interplay of $95$ GeV Diphoton Excess and Dark Matter in Supersymmetric Triplet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of the Higgs boson and the nature of dark matter remain fundamental challenges in particle physics. We investigate the $95$ GeV diphoton excess and dark matter within the framework of the triplet-extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TMSSM). In this model, an additional Hypercharge $Y=0$, $SU(2)_L$ triplet superfield is introduced. Mixing between the triplet and doublet Higgs states enhances the diphoton signal strength of the $95$ GeV Higgs boson, resulting in $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}^{\text{CMS+ATLAS}} = 0.24_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$, which is consistent with experimental observations. This enhancement arises primarily from charged Higgs loop contributions. Additionally, the model accommodates viable dark matter candidates in the form of a bino-dominated neutralino. The relic density is reduced to the observed value through resonance-enhanced annihilation via the Higgs portal or co-annihilation with the triplino or higgsino. This reduction remains consistent with constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments. A comprehensive parameter scan demonstrates that the TMSSM can simultaneously explain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess, the observed $125$ GeV Higgs mass, and the dark matter relic density, establishing a compelling and theoretically consistent framework.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors of $\Omega^-$ with the meson cloud in the spacelike and timelike regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present comprehensive calculations of the electromagnetic form factors, including the charge, magnetic-dipole, electric-quadrupole and magnetic-octupole form factors, of the $\Omega^-$ in the spacelike region using the quark-diquark approach, incorporating the effect of the meson cloud. The obtained magnetic moment is in agreement with the experimental measurement and the electromagnetic radii are comparable with other model calculations. It is found that the meson cloud effect remains almost unchanged as the energy becomes high and this feature implies that the meson cloud should be considered in all the energy region. Moreover, the asymptotic relations allow us to extend the electromagnetic form factors from the spacelike region to the timelike region, and then the effective form factor is almost identical with the data from CLEO and BESIII. Finally, polarization properties of the final state $\Omega^-$ in the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \Omega^- \bar{\Omega}^+$ process with the unpolarized initial states are also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1208.1754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the maximal unitarity method at two loops to double-box basis integrals with up to three external massive legs. We use consistency equations based on the requirement that integrals of total derivatives vanish. We obtain unique formulae for the coefficients of the master double-box integrals. These formulae can be used either analytically or numerically.</description>

      <title>Maximal Unitarity for the Four-Mass Double Box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4632</link>
      <description>arXiv:1308.4632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the maximal-unitarity formalism at two loops to double-box integrals with four massive external legs. These are relevant for higher-point processes, as well as for heavy vector rescattering, VV -&gt; VV. In this formalism, the two-loop amplitude is expanded over a basis of integrals. We obtain formulas for the coefficients of the double-box integrals, expressing them as products of tree-level amplitudes integrated over specific complex multidimensional contours. The contours are subject to the consistency condition that integrals over them annihilate any integrand whose integral over real Minkowski space vanishes. These include integrals over parity-odd integrands and total derivatives arising from integration-by-parts (IBP) identities. We find that, unlike the zero- through three-mass cases, the IBP identities impose no constraints on the contours in the four-mass case. We also discuss the algebraic varieties connected with various double-box integrals, and show how discrete symmetries of these varieties largely determine the constraints.</description>

      <title>Imaginary parts and discontinuities of Wilson line correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5681</link>
      <description>arXiv:1410.5681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of position-space cuts of eikonal diagrams, the set of diagrams appearing in the perturbative expansion of the correlator of a set of straight semi-infinite Wilson lines. The cuts are applied directly to the position-space representation of any such diagram and compute its imaginary part to the leading order in the dimensional regulator. Our cutting prescription thus defines a position-space analog of the standard momentum-space Cutkosky rules. Unlike momentum-space cuts which put internal lines on shell, position-space cuts constrain a number of the gauge bosons exchanged between the energetic partons to be lightlike, leading to a vanishing and a non-vanishing imaginary part for space- and timelike kinematics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic modeling and science reach of DMRadio-m$^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DMRadio-m$^3$ is an experiment that is designed to be sensitive to KSVZ and DFSZ QCD axion models in the 10--200\,MHz (41 neV$/c^2$ -- 0.83 $\mu$eV/$c^2$) range. The experiment uses a solenoidal dc magnetic field to convert an axion dark-matter signal to an ac electromagnetic response in a coaxial copper pickup. The current induced by this axion signal is measured by dc SQUIDs. In this work, we present the electromagnetic modeling of the response of the experiment to an axion signal over the full frequency range of DMRadio-m$^3$, which extends from the low-frequency, lumped-element limit to a regime where the axion Compton wavelength is only a factor of two larger than the detector size. With these results, we determine the live time and sensitivity of the experiment. The primary science goal of sensitivity to DFSZ axions across 30--200 MHz can be achieved with a $3\sigma$ live scan time of 2.9 years.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations measured in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC reports new measurements of jet quenching based on the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from direct photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in pp and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, for triggers in the range $9&lt;E_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}&lt;20$ GeV. The datasets have integrated luminosities of 3.9$ {\rm nb}^{-1}$ for Au+Au and 23$ {\rm pb}^{-1}$ for pp collisions. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. The large uncorrelated jet background in central Au+Au collisions is corrected using a mixed-event approach, which enables precise charged-particle jet measurements at low transverse momentum $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}$ and large $R$. Recoil-jet distributions are reported in the range $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}&lt;25$ \gev. Comparison of the distributions measured in pp and Au+Au collisions reveals strong medium-induced jet yield suppression for $R=0.2$, with markedly less suppression for $R=0.5$. Comparison is also made to theoretical models incorporating jet quenching. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying jet quenching and the angular dependence of medium-induced jet-energy transport, and provide new constraints on modelling such effects.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Chiral Gauge Theories with Flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact results in softly-broken supersymmetric $\text{SU}(N_C)$ chiral gauge theories with charged fermions in one antisymmetric, $N_F$ fundamental, and $N_C+N_F-4$ anti-fundamental representations. We achieve this by considering the supersymmetric version of these theories and utilizing anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking at a scale $m \ll \Lambda$ to generate a vacuum. The connection to non-supersymmetric theories is then conjectured in the limit $m \rightarrow \infty$. For odd $N_C$, we determine the massless fermions and unbroken global symmetries in the infrared. For even $N_C$, we find global symmetries are non-anomalous and no massless fermions. In all cases, the symmetry breaking patterns differ from what the tumbling hypothesis would suggest.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as "sandwich conditions": The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>
