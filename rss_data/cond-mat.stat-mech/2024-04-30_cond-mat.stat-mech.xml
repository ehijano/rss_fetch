      <title>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this paper, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free on-site microscopic symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff, Kirkpatick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are labeled by a positive integer $Q$ and constructed by a deformation of the 2d classical XY model, defined on any lattice, with an on-site potential that preserves a discrete $Q$-fold spin rotation and reflection symmetry. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of Landau-incompatible transitions are easily seen, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase are obtained, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We present quantum models with anomaly-free symmetries that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Rare Events in Extreme Value Statistics of L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rare events in the extreme value statistics of stochastic symmetric jump processes with power tails in the distributions of the jumps, using the big jump principle. The principle states that in the presence of stochastic processes with power tails statistics, if at a certain time a physical quantity takes on a value much larger than its typical value, this large fluctuation is realised through a single macroscopic jump that exceeds the typical scale of the process by several orders of magnitude. In particular, our estimation focuses on the asymptotic behaviour of the tail of the probability distribution of maxima, a fundamental quantity in a wide class of stochastic models used in chemistry to estimate reaction thresholds, in climatology for earthquake risk assessment, in finance for portfolio management, and in ecology for the collective behaviour of species. We determine the analytical form of the probability distribution of rare events in the extreme value statistics of three L\'evy processes; L\'evy flights, L\'evy walks and the L\'evy-Lorentz gas. For the L\'evy flights, we re-obtain through the big jump approach recent analytical results, extending their validity. For the L\'evy-Lorentz gas we show that the topology of the disordered lattice along which the walker moves induces memory effects in its dynamics, which influences the extreme value statistics. Our results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity of periodically driven two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the heat capacity for steady periodically driven systems and as an example we compute it for dissipative two-level systems where the energy gap is time-modulated. There, as a function of ambient temperature, the Schottky peak remains the dominant feature. Yet, in contrast with equilibrium, the quasistatic thermal response of a nonequilibrium system also reveals kinetic information present in the transition rates; e.g., the heat capacity depends on the time-symmetric reactivities and changes by the presence of a kinetic barrier. It still vanishes though at absolute zero, in accord with an extended Nernst heat postulate, but at a different rate from the equilibrium case. More generally, we discuss the dependence on driving frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics in static and dynamic Galton boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbing the arrangements of pegs on a static Galton board can result in non-trivial stationary distributions, which in the continuum limit correspond to departure from regular gaussian behavior. Two such distributions are obtained. Further, the distributions generated for a dynamic galton board under external forcing in a general direction are obtained by solution of the corresponding stochastic differential equations. Exact cumulant generating functions for the distribution are presented for forcing in one dimension. An approximate expression, correct to first order in the forcing amplitude, is presented for the case of two dimensions. Both cases show nontrivial departures from the static gaussian solution.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover in Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) KPZ growth is usually investigated on substrates of lateral sizes $L_x=L_y$, so that $L_x$ and the correlation length ($\xi$) are the only relevant lengths determining the scaling behavior. However, in cylindrical geometry, as well as in flat rectangular substrates $L_x \neq L_y$ and, thus, the surfaces can become correlated in a single direction, when $\xi \sim L_x \ll L_y$. From extensive simulations of several KPZ models, we demonstrate that this yields a dimensional crossover in their dynamics, with the roughness scaling as $W \sim t^{\beta_{\text{2D}}}$ for $t \ll t_c$ and $W \sim t^{\beta_{\text{1D}}}$ for $t \gg t_c$, where $t_c \sim L_x^{1/z_{2\text{D}}}$. The height distributions (HDs) also cross over from the 2D flat [cylindrical] HD to the asymptotic Tracy-Widom GOE [GUE] distribution. Moreover, 2D-to-1D crossovers are found also in the asymptotic growth velocity and in the steady state regime of flat systems, where a family of universal HDs exists, interpolating between the 2D and 1D ones as $L_y/L_x$ increases. Importantly, the crossover scalings are fully determined and indicate a possible way to solve 2D KPZ models.</description>

      <title>BAD-NEUS: Rapidly converging trajectory stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an element of stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Then, building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we propose an improved stratification that allows approximation error to be reduced systematically. We show that the improved stratification can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>On the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation of incoherent precipitates in solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By critically examining the traditional theory of homogeneous nucleation of precipitates in solid solutions, it is revealed that the theory's assertion regarding an increase in the nucleation free energy due to elastic strain associated with the difference in atomic volumes between the two phases is applicable to coherent precipitates, but becomes incorrect when applied to incoherent precipitates. This conclusion is obtained by accounting for thermal point defects in the matrix, which can be absorbed at the interface between an incoherent particle and the matrix during nucleation, thereby relieving elastic stresses. Accordingly, a new kinetic model based on the Reiss theory for binary nucleation is proposed for predicting the nucleation rate of incoherent precipitates by agglomeration of solute atoms and point defects, with a further extension to account for excess vacancies formed under non-equilibrium conditions of quenching experiments.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

      <title>Self-reverting vortices in chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently a strong interest in the collective behavior of chiral active particles that can propel and rotate themselves. In the presence of alignment interactions for many chiral particles, chiral self-propulsion can induce vortex patterns in the velocity fields. However, these emerging patterns are non-permanent, and do not induce global vorticity. Here we combine theoretical arguments and computer simulations to predict a so-far unknown class of collective behavior. We show that, for chiral active particles, vortices with significant dynamical coherence emerge spontaneously. They originate from the interplay between attraction interactions and chirality in the absence of alignment interactions. Depending on parameters, the vortices can either feature a constant vorticity or a vorticity that oscillates periodically in time, resulting in self-reverting vortices. Our results may guide future experiments to realize customized collective phenomena such as spontaneously rotating gears and patterns with a self-reverting order.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum thermal machines in a Lieb-kagome Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems serve as a suitable working medium for realizing quantum thermal machines (QTMs) by offering distinct advantages such as cooperative many-body effects, and performance boost at the quantum critical points. However, the bulk of the existing literature exploring the criticality of many-body systems in the context of QTMs involves models sans the electronic interactions, which are non-trivial to deal with and require sophisticated numerical techniques. Here we adopt the prototypical Hubbard model in two dimensions (2D) in the framework of the line graph Lieb-kagome lattice for the working medium of a multi-functional QTM. We resort to a non-perturbative, static path approximated (SPA) Monte Carlo technique to deal with the repulsive Hubbard model. We observe that in a Stirling cycle, in both the interacting and non-interacting limits, the heat engine function dominates and its performance gets better when the strain is induced from the kagome to the Lieb limit, while for the reverse the refrigeration action is preferred. Further, we show that the QTM performs better when the difference between the temperatures of the two baths is lower and the QTM reaches the Carnot limit in this regime. Further, we extensively study the performance of the QTM in the repulsive Hubbard interacting regime where the magnetic orders come into the picture. We explore the performance of the QTM along the quantum critical points and in the large interaction limit.</description>

      <title>Polymer Collapse and Liquid-Liquid Phase-Separation are Coupled in a Generalized Prewetting Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in controlling gene expression. Specificity in expression is achieved through the interaction of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins with particular sequences of DNA. At unphysiological concentrations many of these nuclear proteins can phase-separate in the absence of DNA, and it has been hypothesized that, in vivo, the thermodynamic forces driving these phases help determine chromosomal organization. However it is unclear how DNA, itself a long polymer subject to configurational transitions, interacts with three-dimensional protein phases. Here we show that a long compressible polymer can be coupled to interacting protein mixtures, leading to a generalized prewetting transition where polymer collapse is coincident with a locally stabilized liquid droplet. We use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations and a mean-field theory to show that these phases can be stable even in regimes where both polymer collapse and coexisting liquid phases are unstable in isolation, and that these new transitions can be either abrupt or continuous. For polymers with internal linear structure we further show that changes in the concentration of bulk components can lead to changes in three-dimensional polymer structure. In the nucleus there are many distinct proteins that interact with many different regions of chromatin, potentially giving rise to many different Prewet phases. The simple systems we consider here highlight chromatin's role as a lower-dimensional surface whose interactions with proteins are required for these novel phases.</description>

      <title>Pinning Disfavors Nucleation in Colloidal Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vapor deposition, known for precise structural control, is inevitably influenced by impurities. These impurities, often distinct from the depositing material, can significantly impact material properties, including local structure. Interestingly, the effect of immobilizing some of the depositing particles themselves, which would still preserve local structural symmetry, remains largely unexplored. By introducing a small fraction of pinned sites during colloidal vapor deposition and employing a combination of thermodynamic and kinematic measurements, we demonstrate that pinned sites, termed "mobility impurities", are disfavored as nucleation centers. Moreover, tuning the mobility of mobile colloids can adjust the likelihood of nucleation. In later stages of growth, pinning induces mode localization, altering the thin film's vibrational spectrum. Our research underscores the potential of strategically incorporating mobility impurities to engineer material properties.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Fluctuations in Viscoelastic Stress: A Comparison of the Temporary Network and Dumbbell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, stress fluctuations in flowing and deformed materials are overlooked, with an obvious focus on average stresses in a continuum mechanical approximation. However, these fluctuations, often dismissed as noise, hold the potential to provide direct insights into the material structure and its structure-stress coupling, uncovering detailed aspects of fluid transport and relaxation behaviors. Despite advancements in experimental techniques allowing for the visualization of these fluctuations, their significance remains largely untapped, as modeling efforts continue to target Newtonian fluids within the confines of Gaussian noise assumptions. In the present work a comparative analysis of stress fluctuations in two distinct microstructural models is carried out: the temporary network model and the dumbbell model. Despite both models conforming to the Upper Convected Maxwell Model at a macroscopic level, the temporary network model predicts non-Gaussian fluctuations. We find that stress fluctuations within the temporary network model exhibit more pronounced abruptness at local scale, with only an enlargement of the control volume leading to a gradual Gaussian-like noise, diminishing the differences between the two models. These findings underscore the heightened sensitivity of fluctuating rheology to microstructural details and the microstructure-flow coupling, beyond what is captured by macroscopically averaged stresses.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Merging Percolation: A long-range percolation process in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Percolation on networks is a common framework to model a wide range of processes, from cascading failures to epidemic spreading. Standard percolation assumes short-range interactions, implying that nodes can merge into clusters only if they are nearest-neighbors. Cumulative Merging Percolation (CMP) is an new percolation process that assumes long-range interactions, such that nodes can merge into clusters even if they are topologically distant. Hence in CMP percolation clusters do not coincide with the topological connected components of the network. Previous work has shown that a specific formulation of CMP features peculiar mechanisms for the formation of the giant cluster, and allows to model different network dynamics such as recurrent epidemic processes. Here we develop a more general formulation of CMP in terms of the functional form of the cluster interaction range, showing an even richer phase transition scenario with competition of different mechanisms resulting in crossover phenomena. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process with Slow Boundaries: A Hydrodynamic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the one-dimensional model of the symmetric simple exclusion process slowly coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundaries. In its non-equilibrium stationary state, the large deviations functions of density and current have been recently derived using exact microscopic analysis by Derrida, Hirschberg and Sadhu in J. Stat. Phys. 182, 15 (2021). We present an independent derivation using the hydrodynamic approach of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT). The slow coupling introduces additional boundary terms in the MFT-action, which modifies the spatial boundary conditions for the associated variational problem. For the density large deviations, we explicitly solve the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations using a simple local transformation of the optimal fields. For the current large deviations, our solution is obtained using the additivity principle. In addition to recovering the expression of the large deviations functions, our solution describes the most probable path for these rare fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Occupation time of a system of Brownian particles on the line with steplike initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of non-interacting Brownian particles on the line with steplike initial condition and study the statistics of the occupation time on the positive half-line. We demonstrate that this system exhibits long-lasting memory effects of the initialization. Specifically, we calculate the mean and the variance of the occupation time, demonstrating that the memory effects in the variance are determined by a generalized compressibility (or Fano factor), associated with the initial condition. In the particular case of the uncorrelated uniform initial condition we conduct a detailed study of two probability distributions of the occupation time: annealed (averaged over all possible initial configurations) and quenched (for a typical configuration). We show that at large times both the annealed and the quenched distributions admit large deviation form and we compute analytically the associated rate functions. We verify our analytical predictions via numerical simulations using Importance Sampling Monte-Carlo strategy.</description>

Abstract: The extended Third Law of thermodynamics for nonequilibrium jump processes is studied in previous collaborative papers (Kh et al.,2023) [1,2], where the nonequilibrium heat capacity and the excess heat with the corresponding quasipotential are introduced. The extended Third Law states that the nonequilibrium heat capacity vanishes under two conditions as the temperature approaches zero. The current paper presents a concise overview of key papers addressing the nonequilibrium calorimetry and the nonequilibrium Nernst postulate (the nonequilibrium Third Law of thermodynamics). The quasipotential is a crucial quantity to calculate the nonequilibrium heat capacity. The new result presented in this work includes an interpretation of the quasipotential in terms of the mean time taken by the Markov jump process, starting from a given state, to reach other states for the first time.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic concentration inequalities and tradeoff relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic tradeoff relations quantify the fundamental concept of "no free lunch" in the physical world, suggesting that faster and more precise physical processes come at a higher thermodynamic cost. The key elements in these tradeoff relations are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and speed limit, which are closely related to information inequalities from which other tradeoff relations are derived. Concentration inequalities are relations that complement information inequalities in statistical analyses and have been widely used in various fields. However, their role in thermodynamic tradeoff relations remains unclear. This study develops thermodynamic concentration inequalities that provide bounds for the distribution of observables in quantum and classical Markov processes. We derive a set of tradeoff relations that generalise speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations from the developed thermodynamic concentration inequalities. The derived tradeoff relations hold under minimal assumptions of the underlying physical processes. This study clarifies the role of concentration inequalities in thermodynamics, paving the way for deriving new tradeoff relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of percolation models where the local occupation variables have long-range correlations decaying as a power law $\sim r^{-a}$ at large distances $r$, for some $0&lt; a&lt; d$ where $d$ is the underlying spatial dimension. For several of these models, we present both, rigorous analytical results and matching simulations that determine the critical exponents characterizing the fixed point associated to their phase transition, which is of second order. The exact values we obtain are rational functions of the two parameters $a$ and $d$ alone, and do not depend on the specifics of the model.</description>

      <title>Intraspecific predator interference promotes biodiversity in ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05098v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining biodiversity is a fundamental issue in ecology. A long-standing puzzle lies in the paradox of the plankton: many species of plankton feeding on a limited variety of resources coexist, apparently flouting the competitive exclusion principle (CEP), which holds that the number of predator (consumer) species cannot exceed that of the resources at a steady state. Here, we present a mechanistic model and demonstrate that intraspecific interference among the consumers enables a plethora of consumer species to coexist at constant population densities with only one or a handful of resource species. This facilitated biodiversity is resistant to stochasticity, either with the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model naturally explains the classical experiments that invalidate the CEP, quantitatively illustrates the universal S-shaped pattern of the rank-abundance curves across a wide range of ecological communities, and can be broadly used to resolve the mystery of biodiversity in many natural ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Strong Determinism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strongly deterministic theory of physics is one that permits exactly one possible history of the universe. In the words of Penrose (1989), ''it is not just a matter of the future being determined by the past; the entire history of the universe is fixed, according to some precise mathematical scheme, for all time.'' Such an extraordinary feature may appear unattainable in a world like ours. In this paper, I show that it can be achieved in a simple way and discuss its implications for metaphysics and philosophy of science, including natural properties, free will, explanation, and modality. First, I propose a precise definition of strong determinism. Next, I discuss its philosophical ramifications and a toy example. Finally, I provide a realistic example of a strongly deterministic (and simple) physical theory -- the Everettian Wentaculus. A surprising consequence is that whether or not our world is strongly deterministic may be empirically underdetermined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states of $k$ qudits (also known as perfect tensors) are quantum states that have maximal entanglement for all possible bipartitions of the sites/parties. We consider the problem of whether such states can be decomposed into a tensor network with a small number of tensors, such that all physical and all auxiliary spaces have the same dimension $D$. We find that certain AME states with $k=6$ can be decomposed into a network with only three 4-leg tensors; we provide concrete solutions for local dimension $D=5$ and higher. Our result implies that certain AME states with six parties can be created with only three two-site unitaries from a product state of three Bell pairs, or equivalently, with six two-site unitaries acting on a product state on six qudits. We also consider the problem for $k=8$, where we find similar tensor network decompositions with six 4-leg tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rate and security of quantum communications between users placed at arbitrary points of a quantum communication network depend on the structure of the network, on its extension and on the nature of the communication channels. In this work we propose a strategy for the optimization of trusted-relays based networks that intertwines classical network approaches and quantum information theory. Specifically, by suitably defining a quantum communication efficiency functional, we identify the optimal quantum communication connections through the network by balancing security and the quantum communication rate. The optimized network is then constructed as the network of the maximal quantum communication efficiency connections and its performance is evaluated by studying the scaling of average properties as functions of the number of nodes and of the network spatial extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Dissipative particle dynamics for coarse-grained models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a computational method based on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) that introduces solvent hydrodynamic interactions to coarse-grained models of solutes, such as ions, molecules, or polymers. DPD-solvent (DPDS) is a fully off-lattice method that allows straightforward incorporation of hydrodynamics at desired solvent viscosity, compressibility and solute diffusivity with any particle-based solute model. Solutes interact with the solvent only through the DPD thermostat, which ensures that the equilibrium properties of the solute system are not affected by the introduction of the DPD solvent. Thus, DPDS can be used as a replacement for traditional molecular dynamics thermostats such as Nos\'e-Hoover and Langevin. We demonstrate the applicability of DPDS on the case of polymer dynamics and electroosmotic flow through a nanopore. The method should be broadly useful as means to introduce hydrodynamics to existing coarse-grained models of molecules and soft materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since it's rediscovery in the twentieth century, the Mpemba effect, where a far-from-equilibrium state may relax faster than a state closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and has recently received significant attention in quantum systems. Many theories explaining this counter-intuitive behavior in classical systems rely on memory effects. However, in quantum systems, the relation between the Mpemba effect and memory has remained unexplored. In this work, we consider a general non-Markovian open quantum setting and reveal new classes of quantum Mpemba effects, with no analog in Markovian quantum dynamics. Generically, open quantum dynamics possess a finite memory time and a unique steady state. Due to non-Markovian dynamics, even if the system is initialized in the steady state it can take a long time to relax back. We find other initial states that reach the steady state much faster. Most notably, we demonstrate that there can be an initial state in which the system reaches the steady state within the finite memory time itself, therefore giving the fastest possible relaxation to stationarity. We verify the effect for quantum dot systems coupled to electronic reservoirs in equilibrium and non-equilibrium setups at weak, intermediate and strong coupling, and both with and without interactions. Our work provides new insights into the rich physics underlying accelerated relaxation in quantum systems.</description>
