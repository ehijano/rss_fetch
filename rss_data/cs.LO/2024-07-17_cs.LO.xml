      <title>Bridging Weighted First Order Model Counting and Graph Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. It can be solved in time polynomial in the domain size for sentences from the two-variable fragment with counting quantifiers, known as $C^2$. This polynomial-time complexity is also retained when extending $C^2$ by one of the following axioms: linear order axiom, tree axiom, forest axiom, directed acyclic graph axiom or connectedness axiom. An interesting question remains as to which other axioms can be added to the first-order sentences in this way. We provide a new perspective on this problem by associating WFOMC with graph polynomials. Using WFOMC, we define Weak Connectedness Polynomial and Strong Connectedness Polynomials for first-order logic sentences. It turns out that these polynomials have the following interesting properties. First, they can be computed in polynomial time in the domain size for sentences from $C^2$. Second, we can use them to solve WFOMC with all of the existing axioms known to be tractable as well as with new ones such as bipartiteness, strong connectedness, being a spanning subgraph, having $k$ connected components, etc. Third, the well-known Tutte polynomial can be recovered as a special case of the Weak Connectedness Polynomial, and the Strict and Non-Strict Directed Chromatic Polynomials can be recovered from the Strong Connectedness Polynomials, which allows us to show that these important graph polynomials can be computed in time polynomial in the number of vertices for any graph that can be encoded by a fixed $C^2$ sentence and a conjunction of an arbitrary number of ground unary literals.</description>

      <title>PutnamBench: Evaluating Neural Theorem-Provers on the Putnam Mathematical Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PutnamBench, a new multilingual benchmark for evaluating the ability of neural theorem-provers to solve competition mathematics problems. PutnamBench consists of 1697 hand-constructed formalizations of 640 theorems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the premier undergraduate-level mathematics competition in North America. All the theorems have formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle; a substantial subset also has Coq formalizations. Proving the theorems requires significant problem-solving ability and proficiency in a broad range of topics taught in undergraduate mathematics courses. We use PutnamBench to evaluate several established neural and symbolic theorem-provers. These approaches can only solve a handful of the PutnamBench problems, establishing the benchmark as a difficult open challenge for research on neural theorem-proving. PutnamBench is available at https://github.com/trishullab/PutnamBench.</description>

      <title>Collapsing the bounded width hierarchy for infinite-domain CSPs: when symmetries are enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that relational structures admitting specific polymorphisms (namely, canonical pseudo-WNU operations of all arities $n \geq 3$) have low relational width. This implies a collapse of the bounded width hierarchy for numerous classes of infinite-domain CSPs studied in the literature. Moreover, we obtain a characterization of bounded width for first-order reducts of unary structures and a characterization of MMSNP sentences that are equivalent to a Datalog program, answering a question posed by Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter. In particular, the bounded width hierarchy collapses in those cases as well. Our results extend the scope of theorems of Barto and Kozik characterizing bounded width for finite structures, and show the applicability of infinite-domain CSPs to other fields.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic logic over semi-primal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14581v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study many-valued coalgebraic logics with semi-primal algebras of truth-degrees. We provide a systematic way to lift endofunctors defined on the variety of Boolean algebras to endofunctors on the variety generated by a semi-primal algebra. We show that this can be extended to a technique to lift classical coalgebraic logics to many-valued ones, and that (one-step) completeness and expressivity are preserved under this lifting. For specific classes of endofunctors, we also describe how to obtain an axiomatization of the lifted many-valued logic directly from an axiomatization of the original classical one. In particular, we apply all of these techniques to classical modal logic.</description>

      <title>On Lower Bounding Minimal Model Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal models of a Boolean formula play a pivotal role in various reasoning tasks. While previous research has primarily focused on qualitative analysis over minimal models; our study concentrates on the quantitative aspect, specifically counting of minimal models. Exact counting of minimal models is strictly harder than #P, prompting our investigation into establishing a lower bound for their quantity, which is often useful in related applications. In this paper, we introduce two novel techniques for counting minimal models, leveraging the expressive power of answer set programming: the first technique employs methods from knowledge compilation, while the second one draws on recent advancements in hashing-based approximate model counting. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the lower bound estimates of the number of minimal models, surpassing the performance of existing minimal model reasoning systems in terms of runtime.</description>
