      <title>Integration of LSTM Networks in Random Forest Algorithms for Stock Market Trading Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is the analysis and selection of stock trading systems that combine different models with data of different nature, such as financial and microeconomic information. Specifically, based on previous work by the authors and applying advanced techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, our objective is to formulate trading algorithms for the stock market with empirically tested statistical advantages, thus improving results published in the literature. Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables. In doing so, Random Forest turned out to be the best performer among the decision trees. We also discuss how the prediction performance of such a hybrid approach can be boosted by selecting the technical variables.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Conditions for COS Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the truncation error of the COS method and give simple, verifiable conditions that guarantee convergence. In one dimension, COS is admissible when the density belongs to both L1 and L2 and has a finite weighted L2 moment of order strictly greater than one. We extend the result to multiple dimensions by requiring the moment order to exceed the dimension. These conditions enlarge the class of densities covered by previous analyses and include heavy-tailed distributions such as Student t with small degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Visibility-Graph Asymmetry as a Structural Indicator of Volatility Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatility clustering is one of the most robust stylized facts of financial markets, yet it is typically detected using moment-based diagnostics or parametric models such as GARCH. This paper shows that clustered volatility also leaves a clear imprint on the time-reversal symmetry of horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed on absolute returns in physical time. For each time point, we compute the maximal forward and backward visibility distances, $L^{+}(t)$ and $L^{-}(t)$, and use their empirical distributions to build a visibility-asymmetry fingerprint comprising the Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, variance difference, entropy difference, and a ratio of extreme visibility spans. In a Monte Carlo study, these HVG asymmetry features sharply separate volatility-clustered GARCH(1,1) dynamics from i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise and from randomly shuffled GARCH series that preserve the marginal distribution but destroy temporal dependence; a simple linear classifier based on the fingerprint achieves about 90\% in-sample accuracy. Applying the method to daily S\&amp;P500 data reveals a pronounced forward--backward imbalance, including a variance difference $\Delta\mathrm{Var}$ that exceeds the simulated GARCH values by two orders of magnitude and vanishes after shuffling. Overall, the visibility-graph asymmetry fingerprint emerges as a simple, model-free, and geometrically interpretable indicator of volatility clustering and time irreversibility in financial time series.</description>
