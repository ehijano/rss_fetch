      <title>Multiscale Hilbert expansion and hydrodynamics beyond Navier-Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A truncated Hilbert expansion with multiple scales is used to construct asymptotic solution of the linearized one-dimensional Boltzmann equation with small Knudsen number. The freedom ganed by introducing new independent time variables is exploited to eliminate the sources of secular behavior as the time interval increases. The regular gas-dynamic equations then appear as necessary conditions for expansion to be uniformly valid on a long time intervals.</description>

      <title>On the Spectrum of Schr\"{o}dinger Operators Interacting at Two Distinct Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form $\Delta - W$ on $L^2_{\text{rad}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, the space of radially symmetric square integrable functions are relevant in a variety of physical contexts. The potential $W$ is taken to be radially symmetric (i.e. $W(x) = W(|x|)$) and to decompose into two components with distinct spatial scales: $W=W_\varepsilon= V_0+V_{1,\varepsilon}$. The second component $V_{1,\varepsilon}(|x|) = \varepsilon^2V_1(\varepsilon |x|)$ represents a scaled potential that becomes increasingly delocalized as $\varepsilon \to 0$. We will assume that both potentials $V_0(r), V_1(r)$ exhibit certain decay properties as $r \to \infty$. We show how the eigenvalue count on the positive real axis is built out of the spectra associated with the two reduced eigenvalue problems on their separate scales. The result is that the total number of eigenvalues of $\Delta - W$ is the sum of the number of positive eigenvalues of $\Delta - V_0$ and $\Delta - V_1$. Our analysis combines dynamical systems techniques with a separation of scales argument, providing a novel framework for studying spectral properties of differential operators where multiple spatial scales interact.</description>

      <title>On the inextensibility assumption in the stability of elastic rings: overhaul of a traditional paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the oldest and most common structural engineering issues is the elastic buckling of circular rings under external pressure, which has a fundamental importance in a number of applications in general mechanics, engineering and bio-physics, just to name a few. Levy is considered to have provided the first significant solution to this problem in 1884, and most stability text-books make reference to this original solution, which is based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam model. Following this incipit, over the past one hundred and forty years a huge number of papers have continued to analyse many special cases and extensions. However, the majority of these studies tend to build on the a-priori assumption of inextensibility of the ring centre line without investigating the real significance and extent of this condition. Here, in the framework of a suitable non-linear kinematic, the problem is re-examined from its roots, and it is shown that not only the inextensibility paradigm cannot straightforwardly lead to the classic solution in an energy framework, but, on the contrary, the extensibility of the ring is necessary to allow a unified and meaningful treatment of buckling and initial post-buckling behaviour for a complete variety of cases. On these bases, some facts and results in literature are rectified and discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis of Ising models, Part III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>

      <title>Solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: semianalytical Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, approximate solutions to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation are constructed by means of the Galerkin method. Specifically, it is shown how the dynamics of a real scalar field in $1+1$ dimensions subjected to Dirichlet boundary conditions and Mexican-hat-like potentials can be approximated by mechanical systems with a few particles. Because the approximation is performed at a Lagrangian level, one of the advantages of this method is the control over conservation laws present in the field theory, which are captured by the finite mechanical systems. Among the results, exact stationary solutions for the nonlinear KG equation are found in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions, which are shown to correspond to stationary configurations of the mechanical systems. Furthermore, numerical simulations are provided, giving hints towards the convergence of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the recent developments of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and links: $\hat{Z}$ and $F_L$. They are $q$-series invariants originated from mathematical physics. They exhibit rich features, for example, quantum modularity, infinite dimensional Verma module structures and knot-quiver correspondence. Furthermore, they have connections to other topological invariants. We also provide a review of an extension of the above series invariants to Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable Schr\"odinger operators related to the hypergeometric equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators defined as closed operators that are exactly solvable in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function. We allow the potentials to be complex.
  These operators fall into three groups. The first group can be reduced to the Gegenbauer equation, up to an affine transformation, a special case of the hypergeometric equation. The two other groups, which we call {\em hypergeometric of the first}, resp. {\em second kind}, can be reduced to the general Gauss hypergeometric equation. Each of the group is subdivided in three families, acting to on the Hilbert space $L^2]-1,1[,$ $L^2(\rr_+)$ resp. $L^2(\rr)$. Motivated by geometric applications of these families, we call them {\em spherical}, {\em hyperbolic}, resp. {\em deSitterian}. All these families are known from applications in Quantum Mechanics: e.g. spherical hypergeometric Schr\"odinger operators of the first kind are often called {\em trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller Hamiltonians}.
  For operators belonging to each family we compute their spectrum and determine their Green function (the integral kernel of their resolvent). We also describe transmutation identities that relate these Green functions. These identities interchange spectral parameters with coupling constants across different operator families. Finally, we describe how these operators arise from separation of variables of (pseudo-)Laplacians on symmetric manifolds.
  Our paper can be viewed as a sequel to \cite{DL}, where closed realizations of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators solvable in terms Kummer's confluent equation were studied.</description>

      <title>Linear viscoelasticity: Mechanics, analysis and approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this review is to highlight the connection between well-established physical and mathematical principles as they pertain to the theory of linear elasticity. We begin by examining the physical foundations of Boltzmann and Volterra's hereditary law formalism, and how those principles restrict the form of the hereditary law. We then turn to questions of material stability and continuous dependence on the stress history within the framework of the Lax-Milgram theorem, which we find to set forth rigorous and unequivocal conditions for the well-posedness of the linear viscoelastic problem. The outcome of this analysis is remarkable in that it gives precise meaning to fundamental physical properties such as fading memory. Finally, we turn to the question of best representation of viscoelastic materials by finite-rank hereditary operators or, equivalently, by a finite set of history or internal variables. We note that the theory of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and $N$-widths supplies the answer to the question.</description>

      <title>A further remark on the density estimate for degenerate Allen-Cahn equations: $\Delta_{p}$-type equations for $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$ with rough coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short remark on a previous paper \cite{SZ25}, we continue the study of Allen-Cahn equations associated with Ginzburg-Landau energies \begin{equation*}
  J(v,\Omega)=\int_{\Omega}\Big\{F(\nabla v,v,x)+W(v,x)\Big\}dx, \end{equation*} involving a Dirichlet energy $F(\vec{\xi},\tau,x)\sim|\vec{\xi}|^{p}$ and a degenerate double-well potential $W(\tau,x)\sim(1-\tau^{2})^{m}$. In contrast to \cite{SZ25}, we remove all regularity assumptions on the Ginzburg-Landau energy. Then, with further assumptions that $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$ and that $W(\tau,x)$ is monotone in $\tau$ on both sides of $0$, we establish a density estimate for the level sets of nontrivial minimizers $|u|\leq1$.</description>

      <title>Logical Dependence of Physical Determinism on Set-theoretic Metatheory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baroque questions of set-theoretic foundations are widely assumed to be irrelevant to physics. In this article, I challenge this assumption. I argue that even the fundamental physical question of whether a theory is deterministic - whether it fixes a unique future given the present - can depend on choice of set-theoretic axiom candidates over which there is deep disagreement. Suppose, as is customary, that a deterministic theory is one whose mathematical formulation yields a unique solution to its governing equations. Then the question of whether a theory is deterministic is the question of whether there exists a unique solution to its mathematical model. I argue that competing axiom candidates extending standard mathematics can diverge on all dimensions of determinism. First, they may disagree about whether a given physical system is well-posed, and so whether a solution exists. Second, even when they agree that a solution exists, they can differ on whether that solution is unique. Finally, even when they agree that a system has a solution, and agree that this solution is unique, they may still dispute what that solution is. Whether a theory is deterministic - and even which outcome it predicts - can depend on choice of set-theoretic metatheory. I indicate how the conclusions extend to discrete systems and suggest directions for future research. One upshot of the discussion is that either physical theories must be relativized to set-theoretic metatheories, in which case physics itself becomes relative, or, as Quine controversially argued, the search for new axioms to settle undecidables may admit of empirical input.</description>

      <title>Dark tranquility: Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. However, the behavior of wave propagation in such extreme habitats remains rich and nuanced. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that persist without ever reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics separable states can be characterized as convex combinations of product states whereas non-separable states exhibit entanglement. Quantum entanglement has played a pivotal role in both theoretical investigations and practical applications within quantum information science. In this study, we explore the connection between product states and geometric structures, specifically manifolds and their associated geometric properties such as the first fundamental form (metric). We focus on the manifolds formed by the product states of M systems of N levels, examining the induced metric derived from the Euclidean metric. For elementary cases we will compute the Levi-Civita connection, and, where computationally tractable, the scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-contraction and asymptotic stability of large shock for scalar viscous conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $L^2$-contraction and time-asymptotic stability of large shock for scalar viscous conservation laws with polynomial flux. For the strictly convex flux $f(u)=u^p $ with $2\leq p \leq 4$, we can prove $L^2$-contraction and time-asymptotic stability of arbitrarily large viscous shock profile in $H^1$-framework by using $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shift and suitable weight function. Additionally, if the initial perturbation belongs to $L^1$, then $L^2$ time-asymptotic decay rate $t^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Sigma function associated with a hyperelliptic curve with two points at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baker constructed basic meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve with two points at infinity. We call them Baker functions. The construction is based on the Abel-Jacobi map, which allows us to identify the field of meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of the curve with the field of meromorphic functions on the symmetric product of the curve. In our previous paper, a solution to the KP equation was constructed in terms of the Baker function. This paper is devoted to the properties of the Baker functions. In this paper, we construct an entire function whose second logarithmic derivatives are the Baker functions. We prove that the power series expansion of the entire function around the origin is determined only by the coefficients of the defining equation of the curve and a branch point of the curve algebraically. We also describe the quasi-periodicity of the entire function and express the entire function in terms of the Riemann theta function.</description>

      <title>Mass Lower Bounds for Asymptotically Locally Flat Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish positive mass type theorems for asymptotically locally flat (ALF) manifolds, which have asymptotic ends modeled on circle bundles over a Euclidean base with fibers of constant length. In particular for dimensions $n\leq 7$, the mass of AF manifolds is shown to be nonnegative under the assumption of nonnegative scalar curvature if a codimension-two coordinate sphere in the asymptotic end is trivial in homology, with zero mass achieved only for the product $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\times S^1$. The same conclusions are obtained in dimension four for ALF manifolds admitting an almost free $U(1)$ action. Moreover, in this setting the mass is shown to be bounded below by a multiple of the degree of the circle bundle at infinity. This is the first such result illustrating how nontrivial topology of the end contributes to the mass.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the Black Hole Interior Volume and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic and conceptual notion of this work starts from the recent investigations of Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli (CR) in their paper entitled ''How big is a black hole?''. This work is related to the black hole interior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior volume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a space-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$. Using this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is proportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this formulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of infalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the charged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical analysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the volume linearly increases with advancing time.
  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black hole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black hole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality constant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy is less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note that these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than the Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand the uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Elephant random walks on infinite Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of elephant random walks on finitely generated infinite groups whose Cayley graphs are homogeneous trees of degree $d \ge 3$ (e.g., groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^{* d_1} * \mathbb{Z}_2^{*d_2}$ with $2d_1 + d_2 \ge 3$). We show that the asymptotic speed of the walk does not depend on the memory parameter $p \in [0, 1)$ and equals $\frac{d - 2}{d}$, the asymptotic speed of simple random walk on these graphs. The rate of convergence to the limiting speed turns out to depend on the memory parameter $p$ and one encounters phase transitions akin to elephant random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear realisation approach to extended supergravity theories in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the nonlinear realisation approach to spontaneously broken supergravity in three dimensions presented in arXiv:2304.09506. Using this approach we provide a novel derivation of $\mathcal{N}$-extended supergravity, with and without a cosmological term. It corresponds to a St\"uckelberg-type extension of the following theories: (i) the $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity theories with $p+q=\mathcal{N}$, $p\geq q\geq 0$ proposed by Ach\'ucarro and Townsend; and (ii) the $\mathcal{N}$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity of Marcus and Schwarz. We also apply the approach to obtain a St\"uckelberg reformulation of the supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$. In our construction, the pure supergravity actions (Poincar\'e and AdS) share the invariance under two different local $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetries. One of them acts on the Goldstini, while the other supersymmetry leaves the Goldstini inert. The $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert. The supersymmetry that acts on the Goldstini can be used to gauge them away, and then the resulting actions coincide with that given in the literature.</description>

Abstract: As an example of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, the mean field Langevin dynamics recently attracts attention due to its connection to (noisy) gradient descent on infinitely wide neural networks in the mean field regime, and hence the convergence property of the dynamics is of great theoretical interest. In this paper, In the continuity of [1, 2], we are interested by the long-time behavior and uniform in time propagation of chaos by synchronous coupling for mean-field Langevin dynamics (over- and under-damped).</description>

      <title>Hierarchically structured, high-efficiency and thermally robust perovskite solar cells with band-engineered double-hole layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising optoelectronic properties of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their commercial viability is hindered by interfacial energy misalignment, suboptimal light absorption, and thermal instability. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 based PSC through integrated electronic and morphological engineering. Firstly, to address interfacial recombination and inefficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL junction, we introduced a double hole transport layer (HTL) stack comprising CuO and I2O5-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which significantly improved energy level alignment and carrier selectivity. Comprehensive multiphysics simulations, combining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical analysis with finite element method (FEM) based electrical and thermal modeling, demonstrated that optimized doping concentrations and thickness parameters within the CuO/Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers can enhance the PCE to 22.78%. However, planar architectures, while offering ease of fabrication and scalability, exhibit weak near-UV and near-infrared absorption, whereas nanostructures attain superior light trapping but incur significant fabrication complexity, underscoring the need for balanced design strategies. To address these inherent limitations, we propose a hierarchical ellipsoidal patterned solar cell (HEPSC), wherein a top-layer ellipsoidal nanostructure is introduced across the full device stack. This design enhances broadband light trapping and optical confinement throughout the active layers while maintaining fabrication feasibility through geometrically realistic structuring.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition JR21 [arXiv:1906.01053], Liu22 [arXiv:1907.09876] and the flat initial condition Liu22 [arXiv:1907.09876] for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions JR22 [arXiv:2010.07357v1], Rah25 [arXiv:2504.19975]. In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. We also verify that the equal time degenerated version of our formula matches the path integral formula in MQR21 [arXiv:1701.00018] for the KPZ fixed point.
  The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key novelty is a probabilistic representation of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in Liu22 [arXiv:1907.09876].</description>

      <title>Parquet theory for molecular systems. I. Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Finite dimensional approximations for Hilbert space operators and applications in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a unified framework for quasidiagonal and F\o lner-type approximations of linear operators on Hilbert spaces. These approximations (originally formulated for bounded operators and operator algebras) involve sequences of non-zero finite rank orthogonal projections that asymptotically commute with the operator -- either in norm (quasidiagonal) or in mean (F\o lner). Such structures guarantee spectral approximation results in terms of their finite sections. We extend this theory to unbounded, densely defined closable operators, establishing a generalization of Halmos' classical result: every closable quasidiagonal operator is a compact perturbation of a closable block-diagonal operator on the same domain. Likewise, we introduce sparse F\o lner sequences and establish an interplay between quasidiagonal approximations and the existence of sparse F\o lner sequences. The theoretical developments are illustrated with explicit examples using different types of weighted shifts and applied to quantum mechanical models, including a detailed treatment of the Weyl algebra and its Schr\"odinger representation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Colorimetric Sensing: Achieving over 5700-fold Accuracy Improvement via Full-Spectrum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in full-spectrum transmission profiles, particularly in intensity-based systems where linear models may be highly effective. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that applying a forward feature selection strategy to normalized transmission spectra, combined with linear regression and ten-fold cross-validation, yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Using food dye dilutions as a model system, the mean squared error was reduced from over 22,000 with a single wavelength to 3.87 using twelve selected features, corresponding to a more than 5,700-fold enhancement. These results validate that full-spectrum modeling enables precise concentration prediction without requiring changes to the sensing hardware. The approach is broadly applicable to colorimetric assays used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial analysis, offering a scalable pathway to improve sensitivity and reliability in existing platforms.</description>

      <title>The properties of resistive MHD modes and unstable spectra in advanced tokamak regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced tokamak regimes, featuring extended regions of low magnetic shear, are promising candidates for future fusion reactors but are also more prone to specific kinds of MHD instabilities. The proximity to a rational surface in a very low shear region weakens field line bending stabilisation and amplifies the effects of toroidal coupling between modes, leading to the emergence of long-wavelength resistive infernal modes. These modes can grow collectively as a discrete spectrum, leading to a cascade of different perturbations for single mode numbers $(m, n)$, with subdominant modes showing increasingly oscillatory radial structures. These spectra of fast-growing modes are significant for developing stable scenarios in future reactors, and for the understanding of global reconnection events like sawteeth, motivating a deeper investigation into their fundamental physics. Deriving new analytic solutions, including a generalisation of the ideal interchange dispersion relation to non monotonic $q$ profiles, and extending a modular linear resistive MHD solver, we investigate how resistivity, compressibility, toroidal effects, and shaping influence stability, especially in reversed shear $q$ profiles. It is also shown that common assumptions in numerical calculations prevent the observation of the full variety of modes present in these advanced scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Charge Conjugation, Correlations, Elitzur's Theorem and the Mass Gap Problem in Lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Models in $d=4$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional Euclidean Wilson lattice Yang-Mills model with gauge group $SU(N)$, and the associated lattice Euclidean quantum field theory constructed by Osterwalder-Schrader-Seiler via a Feynman-Kac formula. In this model, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\in SU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a charge conjugation operator $\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and prove that, for $N\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two sectors with charge conjugation $\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In the space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a similar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown; applications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two distinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the expectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon field parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically in the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field expansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term. However, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar measure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling $\beta=g^{-2}&gt;0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir operator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the analysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the Yang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\not=2$ and at least for small $\beta$, a multiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be present in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large time large deviations for the height function $\mathfrak{h}(x,t)$ of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth introduced in ABW22 [arXiv:2108.06018]. We show that the upper-tail deviations have speed $t$ and derive an explicit formula for the rate function $\Phi_+(\mu)$. On the other hand, we show that the lower-tail deviations have speed $t^2$ and express the corresponding rate function $\Phi_-(\mu)$ in terms of a variational problem. Our analysis relies on distributional identities between the height function $\mathfrak{h}$ and two important measures on the set of integer partitions: the Poissonized Plancherel measure and the cylindric Plancherel measure. Following a scheme developed in DT21 [arXiv:1910.09271], we analyze a Fredholm determinant representation for the $q$-Laplace transform of $\mathfrak{h}(x,t)$, from which we extract exact Lyapunov exponents and through inversion the upper-tail rate function $\Phi_+$. The proof of the lower-tail large deviation principle is more subtle and requires several novel ideas which combine classical asymptotic results for the Plancherel measure and log-concavity properties of Schur polynomials. Techniques we develop to characterize the lower-tail are rather flexible and have the potential to generalize to other solvable growth models.</description>

      <title>The Spherical model and the large-$N$ limit of the Spin $O(N)$ model via the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the relation between the spherical model of Berlin-Kac and the spin $O(N)$ model in the limit $N \to \infty$, and explain how they are connected via the discrete Gaussian free field (GFF).
  Using probabilistic limit theorems and concentration of measure, we prove that the infinite-volume limit of the spherical model on a $d$-dimensional torus is a massive GFF in the high-temperature regime, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Rademacher random constant in the low-temperature regime. The proof at the critical temperature appears to be new and relies on a fine analysis of the zero-average Green's function on the torus.
  We study the spin $O(N)$ model in the double limit of spin dimensionality and torus size. Sending $N \to \infty$ first, and then the torus size to infinity, we show that the different spin coordinates become i.i.d. fields, distributed as a massive GFF in the high-temperature regime, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Gaussian random constant in the low-temperature regime.
  In particular, although the limiting free energies per site of the two models agree at all temperatures, their finite-dimensional laws still differ in terms of their zero modes in the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Propp's benzels and Lai's nearly symmetric hexagons with holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai and to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, which results in exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates a generalization of the classical Sitnikov problem, concentrating on the movement of a satellite along the Z-axis as it interacts with $n$ primary bodies in periodic motion. It establishes the existence of an infinite number of even and anti-periodic solutions with increasing periods. The proof employs the Leray-Schauder degree theory to trace the critical points of action functionals, using a homotopy from solutions when the primary bodies are transformed into circular orbits.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui24].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from the above generalization of Segal's sewing to $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes N}$-modules. Therefore, our result on the convergence of the generalized Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [Hua05a,HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a superspace analogue of combinatorial Hopf algebras (Aguiar-Bergeron-Sottile, 2006), and show that the Hopf superalgebra of quasi-symmetric (resp. symmetric) functions in superspace (Fishel-Lapointe-Pinto, 2019) is a terminal object in the category of all (resp. cocommutative) combinatorial Hopf superalgebras. We also introduce a superspace analogue of chromatic symmetric functions of graphs (Stanley, 1995) using the chromatic Hopf superalgebra of two-colored graphs.</description>

      <title>Causal Classification of Pathological Misner-Type Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate three causality-violating spacetimes: Misner space (including Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model), the pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, and a new model introduced here, the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. Despite their different physical origins -- ranging from a flat vacuum solution to a black-hole-type vacuum solution to a non-vacuum model requiring exotic matter -- all three share a common warped-product structure, $2$-dimensional cylindrical base metrics of Eddington-Finkelstein type, and fundamental causal features such as Cauchy and chronology horizons, acausal regions, and analogous geodesic behaviour. Building on a conjecture first proposed in 2016, we present a formal proof that the three models are pairwise isocausal on their universal covers and on suitable causally regular regions of their compactified forms. The proof is constructive, providing explicit causal bijections on the covers and identifying a concrete deck-equivariance criterion governing descent to the compactified spacetimes: if the equivariance degree satisfies $|k|=1$ the models are globally isocausal, whereas if $|k|&gt;1$ or equivariance fails, then at most a one-way causal relation holds between the compactified models. These results supply a rigorous causal classification linking these spacetimes, placing them within a unified Misner-type family and providing a framework for extending the classification to other causality-violating solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Nonreversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study constructs Markov chain reversibilizations and develops quantum algorithmic techniques to accelerate nonreversible processes. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation via time-modulated velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by mixing processes in analytical laboratories, this work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. We study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation, where the velocity field is modelled as the product of a shear flow and a time-dependent modulation function $\xi(t)$. The main objective of this paper is to derive quantitative estimates for the energy decay rates, which are shown to depend sensitively on the properties of $\xi$. We identify a class of time-dependent functions that are bounded by increasing functions, for which we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases. Additionally, we explore the case of velocity fields that may be switched on and off over time. Here, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical flows of this class: one exhibiting a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework, adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust decay estimates.</description>

Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global variants of four-dimensional gauge theories are specified by their spectrum of genuine Wilson-'t Hooft line operators. The choice of global variant has significant consequences when spacetime is taken to be $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$. We focus on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories, which are closely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We establish, on general grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on the integrable system side by introducing a notion of global variants for complex many-body integrable systems associated with Lie algebras. Focusing on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories of type $A$ and $B_2$, we elucidate the implications for the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries realized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of multiplicative anomaly of zeta regularization is solved for polynomials. For a regularizable sequence $\Lambda$, we explicitly calculate the zeta regularized product of $(\Lambda-z_1)\dots(\Lambda-z_n)$ for $z_1,\dots,z_n\in\mathbb{C}$. We give an explicit formula for the discrepancies between polynomials. Our results imply Mizuno's theorem as a special case. We furthermore give novel regularized product formulas for multi-dimensional products in terms of Barnes multiple gamma functions, zeros of the Riemann zeta function and zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials, known as transfer charge models. Focusing on the non-self-adjoint setting that arises in the study of solitons, we systematically develop the scattering theory and establish dispersive estimates under the assumption that the potentials move at significantly different velocities, even in the presence of unstable modes. In particular, we prove the existence of wave operators, asymptotic completeness, and pointwise decay of solutions, without requiring the absence of threshold resonances. Our analysis set up the fundamental work for studying the nonlinear dynamics of multi-solitons, including asymptotic stability and collisions.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle in the real line I compile and contrast, starting with a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, following from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. It was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two spatial dimensions, an important model in plasma physics. For small, smooth, and spatially localized initial data, we establish the global existence of solutions and characterize their sharp long-time behavior, including sharp time decay and scattering properties. A particularly interesting phenomenon is that the Klein-Gordon component exhibits modified scattering for certain initial data, while for others it undergoes linear scattering-a dichotomy highlighting delicate long-range interaction effects.
  The major obstacles are lack of symmetry and weak decay of the solution in two dimensions. To overcome these, we introduce a novel nonlinear transformation of the wave component and reinterpret the nonlinear coupling as a perturbation of the mass term in the Klein-Gordon equation. The proof employs a combination of physical space and frequency space methods.</description>

      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical. This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case.
  This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>

      <title>On dissipation operators of Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider dissipation operators used in Quantum Optics for the description of quantum spontaneous emission in the context of damped driven Jaynes-Cummings equations. The equations describe quantised one-mode Maxwell field coupled to a two-level molecule. Our main result is the symmetry and nonpositivity of basic dissipation operator of Quantum Optics.</description>
