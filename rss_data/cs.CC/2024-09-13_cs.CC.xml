      <title>New constructions of pseudorandom codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced in [CG24], pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs) are a new cryptographic primitive with applications in watermarking generative AI models. These are codes where a collection of polynomially many codewords is computationally indistinguishable from random, except to individuals with the decoding key. In this work, we examine the assumptions under which PRCs with robustness to a constant error rate exist.
  1. We show that if both the planted hyperloop assumption introduced in [BKR23] and security of a version of Goldreich's PRG hold, then there exist public-key PRCs for which no efficient adversary can distinguish a polynomial number of codewords from random with better than $o(1)$ advantage.
  2. We revisit the construction of [CG24] and show that it can be based on a wider range of assumptions than presented in [CG24]. To do this, we introduce a weakened version of the planted XOR assumption which we call the weak planted XOR assumption and which may be of independent interest.
  3. We initiate the study of PRCs which are secure against space-bounded adversaries. We show how to construct secret-key PRCs of length $O(n)$ which are $\textit{unconditionally}$ indistinguishable from random by $\text{poly}(n)$ time, $O(n^{1.5-\varepsilon})$ space adversaries.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error Bound for Quantum Machine Learning in NISQ Era -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the mounting anticipation for the quantum revolution, the success of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era hinges on a largely unexplored factor: the generalization error bound, a cornerstone of robust and reliable machine learning models. Current QML research, while exploring novel algorithms and applications extensively, is predominantly situated in the context of noise-free, ideal quantum computers. However, Quantum Circuit (QC) operations in NISQ-era devices are susceptible to various noise sources and errors. In this article, we conduct a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to explore the state-of-the-art generalization bound for supervised QML in NISQ-era and analyze the latest practices in the field. Our study systematically summarizes the existing computational platforms with quantum hardware, datasets, optimization techniques, and the common properties of the bounds found in the literature. We further present the performance accuracy of various approaches in classical benchmark datasets like the MNIST and IRIS datasets. The SMS also highlights the limitations and challenges in QML in the NISQ era and discusses future research directions to advance the field. Using a detailed Boolean operators query in five reliable indexers, we collected 544 papers and filtered them to a small set of 37 relevant articles. This filtration was done following the best practice of SMS with well-defined research questions and inclusion and exclusion criteria.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Observable to Address Noise in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field that combines the power of quantum computing with the principles of machine learning. One of the significant challenges in QML is dealing with noise in quantum systems, especially in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Noise in quantum systems can introduce errors in quantum computations and degrade the performance of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning observables that are robust against noisy channels in quantum systems. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn observables that remain invariant under the effects of noise and show that this can be achieved through a machine-learning approach. We present a toy example using a Bell state under a depolarization channel to illustrate the concept of robust observables. We then describe a machine-learning framework for learning such observables across six two-qubit quantum circuits and five noisy channels. Our results show that it is possible to learn observables that are more robust to noise than conventional observables. We discuss the implications of this finding for quantum machine learning, including potential applications in enhancing the stability of QML models in noisy environments. By developing techniques for learning robust observables, we can improve the performance and reliability of quantum machine learning models in the presence of noise, contributing to the advancement of practical QML applications in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Gaussian Testing and Non-Gaussian Measures via Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the properties of fermionic convolution defined by fermionic Gaussian unitary. A key finding is the purity invariance of pure Gaussian states under this convolution. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient protocol to test the fermionic Gaussianity of pure states by using 3 copies of the input states. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of measures called ``Non-Gaussian Entropy,'' designed to quantify the fermionic non-Gaussianity of states.</description>

      <title>Communication Separations for Truthful Auctions: Breaking the Two-Player Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the communication complexity of truthful combinatorial auctions, and in particular the case where valuations are either subadditive or single-minded, which we denote with $\mathsf{SubAdd}\cup\mathsf{SingleM}$. We show that for three bidders with valuations in $\mathsf{SubAdd}\cup\mathsf{SingleM}$, any deterministic truthful mechanism that achieves at least a $0.366$-approximation requires $\exp(m)$ communication. In contrast, a natural extension of [Fei09] yields a non-truthful $\mathrm{poly}(m)$-communication protocol that achieves a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation, demonstrating a gap between the power of truthful mechanisms and non-truthful protocols for this problem.
  Our approach follows the taxation complexity framework laid out in [Dob16b], but applies this framework in a setting not encompassed by the techniques used in past work. In particular, the only successful prior application of this framework uses a reduction to simultaneous protocols which only applies for two bidders [AKSW20], whereas our three-player lower bounds are stronger than what can possibly arise from a two-player construction (since a trivial truthful auction guarantees a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for two players).</description>

      <title>Pure-Circuit: Tight Inapproximability for PPAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art methods for showing inapproximability in PPAD arise from the $\varepsilon$-Generalized-Circuit ($\varepsilon$-GCircuit) problem. Rubinstein (2018) showed that there exists a small unknown constant $\varepsilon$ for which $\varepsilon$-GCircuit is PPAD-hard, and subsequent work has shown hardness results for other problems in PPAD by using $\varepsilon$-GCircuit as an intermediate problem.
  We introduce Pure-Circuit, a new intermediate problem for PPAD, which can be thought of as $\varepsilon$-GCircuit pushed to the limit as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 1$, and we show that the problem is PPAD-complete. We then prove that $\varepsilon$-GCircuit is PPAD-hard for all $\varepsilon &lt; 0.1$ by a reduction from Pure-Circuit, and thus strengthen all prior work that has used GCircuit as an intermediate problem from the existential-constant regime to the large-constant regime.
  We show that stronger inapproximability results can be derived by reducing directly from Pure-Circuit. In particular, we prove tight inapproximability results for computing approximate Nash equilibria and approximate well-supported Nash equilibria in graphical games, for finding approximate well-supported Nash equilibria in polymatrix games, and for finding approximate equilibria in threshold games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14075v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientists have demonstrated that quantum computing has presented novel approaches to address computational challenges, each varying in complexity. Adapting problem-solving strategies is crucial to harness the full potential of quantum computing. Nonetheless, there are defined boundaries to the capabilities of quantum computing. This paper concentrates on aggregating prior research efforts dedicated to solving intricate classical computational problems through quantum computing. The objective is to systematically compile an exhaustive inventory of these solutions and categorize a collection of demanding open problems that await further exploration. Through statistical analysis, we help the researchers with their further investigations.</description>

      <title>A Gap-ETH-Tight Approximation Scheme for Euclidean TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.03778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classic task of finding the shortest tour of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any fixed constant $d \geq 2$. We determine the optimal dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the running time of an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate tour, under a plausible assumption. Specifically, we give an algorithm that runs in $2^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} n\log n$ time. This improves the previously smallest dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the running time $(1/\varepsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}n \log n$ of the algorithm by Rao and Smith~(STOC 1998). We also show that a $2^{o(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}\text{poly}(n)$ algorithm would violate the Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH).
  Our new algorithm builds upon the celebrated quadtree-based methods initially proposed by Arora (J. ACM 1998), but it adds a new idea that we call \emph{sparsity-sensitive patching}. On a high level this lets the granularity with which we simplify the tour depend on how sparse it is locally. We demonstrate that our technique extends to other problems, by showing that for Steiner Tree and Rectilinear Steiner Tree it yields the same running time. We complement our results with a matching Gap-ETH lower bound for Rectilinear Steiner Tree.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding approximate stationary points, i.e., points where the gradient is approximately zero, of non-convex but smooth objective functions $f$ over unrestricted $d$-dimensional domains is one of the most fundamental problems in classical non-convex optimization. Nevertheless, the computational and query complexity of this problem are still not well understood when the dimension $d$ of the problem is independent of the approximation error. In this paper, we show the following computational and query complexity results:
  1. The problem of finding approximate stationary points over unrestricted domains is PLS-complete.
  2. For $d = 2$, we provide a zero-order algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary points that requires at most $O(1/\varepsilon)$ value queries to the objective function.
  3. We show that any algorithm needs at least $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to the objective function and/or its gradient to find $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary points when $d=2$. Combined with the above, this characterizes the query complexity of this problem to be $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$.
  4. For $d = 2$, we provide a zero-order algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-KKT points in constrained optimization problems that requires at most $O(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ value queries to the objective function. This closes the gap between the works of Bubeck and Mikulincer [2020] and Vavasis [1993] and characterizes the query complexity of this problem to be $\Theta(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$.
  5. Combining our results with the recent result of Fearnley et al. [2022], we show that finding approximate KKT points in constrained optimization is reducible to finding approximate stationary points in unconstrained optimization but the converse is impossible.</description>
