      <title>ChemRecon: a Consolidated Meta-Database Platform for Biochemical Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present ChemRecon, a meta-database and Python interface for integrating and exploring biochemical data across multiple heterogeneous resources by consolidating compounds, reactions, enzymes, molecular structures, and atom-to-atom maps from several major databases into a single, consistent ontology. ChemRecon enables unified querying, cross-database analysis, and the construction of graph-based representations of sets of related database entries by the traversal of inter-database connections. This facilitates information extraction which is impossible within any single database, including deriving consensus information from conflicting sources, of which identifying the most probable molecular structure associated with a given compound is just one example. The Python interface is available via pip from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/chemrecon/). ChemRecon is open-source and the source code is hosted at GitLab (https://gitlab.com/casbjorn/chemrecon). Documentation and additional information is available at https://chemrecon.org.</description>

      <title>Free Lunch in Medical Image Foundation Model Pre-training via Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image foundation models (MIFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for a wide range of clinical tasks, yet their development is constrained by the scarcity, heterogeneity, and high cost of large-scale annotated datasets. Here, we propose RaSD (Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement), a scalable framework for pre-training MIFMs entirely on synthetic data. By modeling anatomical structures and appearance variations with randomized Gaussian distributions, RaSD exposes models to sufficient multi-scale structural and appearance perturbations, forcing them to rely on invariant and task-relevant anatomical cues rather than dataset-specific textures, thereby enabling robust and transferable representation learning. We pre-trained RaSD on 1.2 million 3D volumes and 9.6 million 2D images, and extensively evaluated the resulting models across 6 imaging modalities, 48 datasets, and 56 downstream tasks. Across all evaluated downstream tasks, RaSD consistently outperforms training-from-scratch models, achieves the best performance on 17 tasks, and remains comparable to models pre-trained on large real datasets in most others. These results demonstrate that the capacity of synthetic data alone to drive robust representation learning. Our findings establish a paradigm shift in medical AI, demonstrating that synthetic data can serve as a "free lunch" for scalable, privacy-preserving, and clinically generalizable foundation models.</description>

      <title>EMERALD-UI: An interactive web application to unveil novel protein biology hidden in the suboptimal-alignment space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life over the past four billion years has been shaped by proteins and their capacity to assemble into three dimensional conformations. Protein sequence alignments have been the enabling technology for exploring the evolution and functional adaptation of proteins across the tree of life. Recent advancements in scaling the prediction of three dimensional protein structures from primary sequence alone, revealed that different modes of conservation and function operate on the sequence and structure level. This difference in protein conservation patterns and their underlying functional change that could emerge in suboptimal alignment configurations is often ignored in optimal protein alignment approaches. We introduce EMERALD-UI, an open-source interactive web application which is designed to reveal unexplored biology by visualising stable structural conformations or protein regions hidden in the suboptimal alignment space.
  Availability: EMERALD-UI is available at https://algbio.github.io/emerald-ui/.

      <title>LinkedNN: a neural model of linkage disequilibrium decay for recent effective population size inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Summary: A bioinformatics tool is presented for estimating recent effective population size by using a neural network to automatically compute linkage disequilibrium-related features as a function of genomic distance between polymorphisms. The new method outperforms existing deep learning and summary statistic-based approaches using relatively few sequenced individuals and variant sites, making it particularly valuable for molecular ecology applications with sparse, unphased data. Availability and implementation: The program is available as an easily installable Python package with documentation here: https://pypi.org/project/linkedNN/. The open source code is available from: https://github.com/the-smith-lab/LinkedNN.</description>

      <title>A Reanalysis of the FDA's Benefit--Risk Assessment of Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID Vaccine Based on a Model Incorporating Benefits Derived from Prior COVID Infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a benefit-risk assessment for Moderna's COVID vaccine mRNA-1273 prior to its full approval, announced 1/31/2022. The FDA's assessment focused on males of ages 18-64 years because the agency's risk analysis was limited to vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis (VAM/P) given the excess risk among males. The FDA's analysis concluded that vaccine benefits clearly outweighed risks, even for 18-25-year-old males (those at highest VAM/P risk). We reanalyze the FDA's benefit-risk assessment using information available through the third week of January 2022 and focusing on 18-25-year-old males. We use the FDA's framework but extend its model by accounting for protection derived from prior COVID infection, finer age-stratification in COVID-hospitalization rates, and incidental hospitalizations (those of patients who test positive for COVID but are being treated for something else). We also use more realistic projections of Omicron-infection rates and more accurate rates of VAM/P. With hospitalizations as the principal endpoint of the analysis (those prevented by vaccination vs. those caused by VAM/P), our model finds vaccine risks outweighed benefits for 18-25-year-old males, except in scenarios projecting implausibly high Omicron-infection prevalence. Our assessment suggests that mRNA-1273 vaccination of 18-25-year-old males generated between 8% and 52% more hospitalizations from vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis alone compared to COVID hospitalizations prevented (over a five-month period of vaccine protection assumed by the FDA). The preceding assessment derives from model inputs based on data available at the time of the FDA's mRNA-1273 assessment. Moreover, these inputs as well as model outputs are validated by subsequently available data.</description>

      <title>SimAQ: Mitigating Experimental Artifacts in Soft X-Ray Tomography using Simulated Acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft X-ray tomography provides detailed structural insight into whole cells but is hindered by experimental artifacts such as the missing wedge and by limited availability of annotated datasets. We present SimAQ, a simulation pipeline that generates realistic yeast phantoms and applies synthetic imaging artifacts to produce paired noisy volumes, sinograms, and reconstructions. We validate our approach by training a neural network primarily on synthetic data and demonstrate effective few-shot and zero-shot transfer learning on real X-ray tomograms. Our model delivers accurate segmentations, enabling quantitative analysis of noisy tomograms without relying on large labeled datasets.</description>

      <title>Biomechanically Informed Image Registration for Patient-Specific Aortic Valve Strain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aortic valve (AV) biomechanics play a critical role in maintaining normal cardiac function. Pathological variations, particularly in bicuspid aortic valves, alter leaflet loading, increase strain, and accelerate disease progression. Accurate patient-specific characterization of valve geometry and deformation is therefore essential for predicting disease progression and guiding durable repair. Current imaging and computational methods often fail to capture rapid valve motion and complex patient-specific features, limiting precise biomechanical assessment. To address these limitations, we developed an image registration framework coupled with the finite element method (FEM) to improve AV tracking and biomechanical evaluation. The valve geometries derived from 4D echocardiography and CT were used to simulate AV closure and generate intermediate deformation states. These FEM-generated states facilitated leaflet tracking, while image registration corrected misalignment between simulations and imaging data. In 20 patients, FEM-augmented registration improved accuracy by 40% compared with direct registration. This improvement enabled more reliable strain estimation by measuring leaflet deformation directly from imaging and reducing uncertainties associated with boundary conditions and material assumptions. Areal, Green-Lagrange, and deviatoric strains were quantified in adult trileaflet/bicuspid valves, as well as pediatric patients, revealing distinct deformation patterns across valve groups. Convergence in mean deviatoric strain between adult trileaflet and pediatric valves suggests volumetric deformation underlies age- and size-related differences in AV mechanics. The FEM-augmented registration enhances tracking and biomechanical evaluation accuracy, providing clinically relevant insights into patient-specific AV deformation to support individualized medical and intervention planning.</description>

      <title>EVA: Towards a universal model of the immune system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective application of foundation models to translational research in immune-mediated diseases requires multimodal patient-level representations that can capture complex phenotypes emerging from multicellular interactions. Yet most current biological foundation models focus only on single-cell resolution and are evaluated on technical metrics often disconnected from actual drug development tasks and challenges. Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies. We release an open version of EVA for transcriptomics to accelerate research on immune-mediated diseases.</description>
