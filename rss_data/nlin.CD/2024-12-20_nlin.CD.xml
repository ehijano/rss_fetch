      <title>Accurate modeling of continuous-time SAT solvers in SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing dynamical systems as solvers of NP-complete problems. In this paper, we present accurate implementations of two continuous-time dynamical solvers, known in the literature as analog SAT and digital memcomputing, using advanced numerical integration algorithms of SPICE circuit simulators. For this purpose, we have developed Python scripts that convert Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems into electronic circuits representing the analog SAT and digital memcomputing dynamical systems. Our Python scripts process conjunctive normal form (CNF) files and create netlists that can be directly imported into LTspice. We explore the SPICE implementations of analog SAT and digital memcomputing solvers by applying these to a selected set of problems and present some interesting and potentially useful findings related to digital memcomputing and analog SAT.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>

      <title>Characterising the dynamics of unlabelled temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks model the architecture backbone of complex systems. The backbone itself can change over time leading to what is called `temporal networks'. Interpreting temporal networks as trajectories in graph space of a latent graph dynamics has recently enabled the extension of concepts and tools from dynamical systems and time series to networks. Here we address temporal networks with unlabelled nodes, a case that has received relatively little attention so far. Situations in which node labelling cannot be tracked over time often emerge in practice due to technical challenges, or privacy constraints. In unlabelled temporal networks there is no one-to-one matching between a network snapshot and its adjacency matrix. Characterizing the dynamical properties of such unlabelled network trajectories is nontrivial. We here exploit graph invariants to extend to the unlabelled setting network-dynamical quantifiers of linear correlations and dynamical instability. In particular, we focus on autocorrelation functions and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We show with synthetic graph dynamics that the measures are capable of recovering and estimating these dynamical fingerprints even when node labels are unavailable. We also validate the methods for some empirical temporal networks with removed node labels.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each Floquet eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a hybrid regular and chaotic system, we use the energy dispersion to separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The distribution of quasi-energies in the ergodic subspace resembles that of a random matrix model. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Quantum three-rotor problem in the identity representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum three-rotor problem concerns the dynamics of 3 equally massive particles moving on a circle subject to pairwise attractive cosine potentials and can model coupled Josephson junctions. Classically, it displays order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy. The quantum system admits a dimensionless coupling with semiclassical behavior at strong coupling. We study stationary states with periodic `relative' wave functions. Perturbative and harmonic approximations capture the spectrum at weak coupling and that of low-lying states at strong coupling. More generally, the cumulative distribution of energy levels obtained by numerical diagonalization is well-described by a Weyl-like semiclassical estimate. However, the system has an $S_3 \times Z_2$ symmetry that is obscured when working with relative angles. By exploiting a basis for invariant states, we obtain the spectrum restricted to the identity representation. To uncover universal quantum hallmarks of chaos, we partition the spectrum into energy windows where the classical motion is regular, mixed or chaotic and unfold each separately. At strong coupling, we find striking signatures of transitions between regularity and chaos: spacing distributions morph from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson while the number variance shifts from linear to logarithmic behavior at small lengths. Some nonuniversal features are also examined. For instance, for strong coupling, the number variance saturates and oscillates at large lengths while the spectral form factor displays a nonuniversal peak at short times. Moreover, deviations from Poisson spacings at asymptotically low and high energies are well-explained by quantum harmonic and free-rotor spectra projected to the identity representation at strong and weak coupling. Interestingly, the degeneracy of free-rotor levels admits an elegant formula that we deduce using properties of Eisenstein primes.</description>
