      <title>Design and Performance of a Universal SiPM Readout System for X- and Gamma-Ray Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of both multi-messenger and time-domain astrophysics over the last decade has seen a large interest in the development of small-scale, cheap, and robust gamma-ray detectors. This has been further encouraged by the availability of CubeSat platforms. Of particular interest are detectors capable of producing spectral and localization measurements of X and gamma-ray transients to allow for accurate follow-up measurements at different wavelengths. A vast number of the instruments developed for such purposes in the last years use a combination of scintillators and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) for photon detection. Here, we present the design, performance, and space qualification of a readout system capable of reading out 64 SiPM channels. This low-power and low-cost system was originally designed for the POLAR-2 mission, a large scale gamma-ray polarimeter. However, its flexible design makes it equally suitable for use on various CubeSat missions. The system was found to perform well when reading out both plastic and high Z scintillators using a total of 1.8~W. The space qualified design furthermore relies on commercial off-the-shelf components, thereby also removing most international export issues. In this paper, we will present the overall design, the performance of the electronics, its performance when reading out various scintillators and the successful space-qualification of this design.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Imaging: Hide and Seek with Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, most of the about 5700 exoplanets have been discovered mainly with radial velocity and transit methods. These techniques are sensitive to planets in close orbits, not being able to probe large star--planet separations. $\mu$-lensing is the indirect method that allows us to probe the planetary systems at the snow-line and beyond, but it is not a repeatable observation. On the contrary, direct imaging (DI) allows for the detection and characterization of low mass companions at wide separation (\mbox{$\leq$ 5--6 au}). The main challenge of DI is that a typical planet--star contrast ranges from $10^{-6}$, for a young Jupiter in emitted light, to $10^{-9}$ for Earth in reflected light. In the last two decades, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to combining large (D $\geq$ 5 m) telescopes (to reduce the impact of diffraction) with coronagraphs and high-order adaptive optics (to correct phase errors induced by atmospheric turbulence), with sophisticated image post-processing, to reach such a contrast between the star and the planet in order to detect and characterize cooler and closer companions to nearby stars. Building on the first pioneering instrumentation, the second generation of high-contrast imagers, SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO, allowed us to probe hundreds of stars (e.g., 500--600 stars using SHINE and GPIES), contributing to a better understanding of the demography and the occurrence of planetary systems. The DI offers a possible clear vision for studying the formation and physical properties of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs, and the future DI (space and ground-based) instruments with deeper detection limits will enhance this vision. In this paper, we briefly review the methods, the instruments, the main sample of targeted stars, the remarkable results, and the perspective of this rising technique.</description>

      <title>Easy remote observations using web interfaces: controlling an Italian telescope from Japan, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote observations are often limited by user interfaces, which seem frozen to another computer era: low performances, outdated programming languages, command-line scripting, high version-dependent software. Instead, web-based tools are standard: using nothing more than a browser, astronomers can interact with a generic observatory in a native cross-platform, remote-born way. We used this approach while advancing in the remotization of the 1m-class OARPAF telescope, located in Northern Italy. The web-based control software provides easy and integrated management of its components. This solution can be exported not only to similar hardware/software facilities, but also to large instruments such as SHARK-NIR at LBT; not only for single operations, but also for procedure scripting. In this contribution we describe our best practices and present two recent, orthogonal use cases: an in-place professional use for exoplanetary transit follow-ups, and the first remote control of the telescope from a Japanese high school, allowing students to independently observe, in their daytime, globular clusters</description>

      <title>Improvements to SHINS, the SHARK-NIR Instrument Software, during the AIT phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of SHARK-NIR (System for coronagraphy with High Order adaptive optics in Z and H band), we present the development of SHINS, the SHARK-NIR INstrument control Software, in particular focusing on the changes introduced during the Assembly, Integration, and Test (AIT) phase. SHARK-NIR observing sessions will be carried out with "ESO-style" Observation Blocks (OBs) based on so-called Templates scripts that will be prepared by observers. We decided to develop Templates also for the large number of AIT tests (flexures, coronagraphic mask alignment, scientific camera performances...). Here we present the adopted HTTP API for the OBs generation and a web-based frontend that implements it. Taking advantage of this approach, we decided to expose APIs also for individual device movement and monitoring, as well as for general status. These APIs are then used in the web-based instrument control and synoptic panels. During the recent AIT phase, a potential collision issue between two motorized components emerged. While we are exploring the possibility of a hardware interlock, we present a software solution developed at the Observation Software level, that is also available while using other software such as engineering panels. The system is based on three protection layers and it has been successfully tested.</description>

      <title>Toward the remotization and robotization of the OARPAF telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OARPAF (Osservatorio Astronomico Regionale Parco Antola Comune di Fascia, Italy) hosts an 80cm Astelco telescope with a Gambato Dome, SBIG-STX camera, Davis weather station, and SBIG AllSky camera. We present a layer-structured python3 framework to control these devices. Layer 1 provides straightforward getter/setter interface for "atomic" operations on devices. Layer 2 wraps the above mentioned atomic operations into "ESO-style" Templates, to perform sequences of common pointing, observation, and calibration operations called "Observation Blocks" (OBs) that are run by a sequencer. Layer 3 is a REST API based on HTTP verbs to expose methods that control Layer 1 devices and Layer 2. We also present a web interface built on top of this layer. The work is part of the frame for remoting and robotizing the observatory.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Multiple Channels Room Temperature Readout Electronics for Large Transition-Edge Sensor Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensor (TES) is a highly sensitive device that is capable of detecting extremely low levels of energy. It is characterised by low noise performance and high energy resolution. A mature method for reading out TES signal is through time-division multiplexing (TDM) direct current superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In a TDM system, the signal readout chain represents a significant source of noise other than the TES intrinsic noise. The noise generated by TES is in the range of several tens to several hundreds of $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. In order to ensure the high energy resolution of TES, it is necessary to ensure that the noise contribution from the room temperature readout electronics is less than $10$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$. In this work, we have designed a low-noise, high-resolution room temperature readout circuit for TDM. The equivalent current noise contribution of ADC is about $0.05$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$ and $0.46$ $pA\sqrt{Hz}$ under 30:1 multiplexing. The resolution of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is larger than 11.5 bits, which can reconstruct the TES signal without distortion. The readout board, which has eight channels, has JESD204B serial ports, which has greatly simplified the space of room temperature electronics. The readout chain is based on multi-threaded CPU processing and can transfer data at 2 $Gbps$ for each channel in real time. This readout board can be used in a TDM system with smaller size for large TES arrays.</description>

      <title>Helical Magnetic Field in a Massive Protostellar Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly collimated outflows (jets) are observed across a wide range of astrophysical systems involving the accretion of material onto central objects, from supermassive black holes in active galaxies to proto-brown dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. Despite the diversity of their driving sources, it is believed that all jets are different manifestations of a single universal phenomenon. However, a unified explanation for their ejection and collimation remains elusive. In this study we present the first rotation measure analysis of the polarized synchrotron emission ever performed in a protostellar radio jet, which allows us to reveal its true 3D magnetic structure. Unlike extragalactic radio jets, which often exhibit faint counterjets, protostellar radio jets allow both the jet and the counterjet to be analyzed. This exceptional circumstance allows us to unveil the magnetic field structure of both components. Our findings provide the first solid evidence for a helical magnetic field within a protostellar jet, supporting the universality of the jet collimation mechanism.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of weak gravitational lensing and its current applications in cosmology. We begin by introducing the fundamental concepts of gravitational lensing and derive the key equations for the deflection angle, lensing potential, convergence, and shear. We explore how weak lensing can be used as a cosmological probe, discussing cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and their combination with galaxy clustering in the 3$\times$2pt analysis. The chapter covers the theoretical framework for modeling lensing observables, shear estimation techniques, and major systematic effects such as intrinsic alignments and baryonic feedback. We review the current results of weak lensing cosmology from major surveys and outline prospects for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated LISA parameter estimation with full time domain response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first full Bayesian inference analysis for LISA parameter estimation incorporating the effects of subdominant harmonics and spin-precession through a full time domain response. The substantial computational demands of using time domain waveforms for LISA are significantly mitigated by implementing a novel Python version of the IMRPhenomT family of waveform models and the LISA response with GPU acceleration. This time domain response alleviates the theoretical necessity of developing specific transfer functions to approximate the LISA response in the Fourier domain for each specific type of system and allows for the use of unequal arms configurations and realistic LISA orbits. Our analysis includes a series of zero-noise injections for a Massive Black Hole Binary with aligned and precessing spins. We investigate the impact of including subdominant harmonics, compare equal and unequal arm configurations, and analyze different Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) configurations. We utilize full and uniform priors, with a lower frequency cutoff of 0.1mHz, and a signal duration of approximately two months, sampled every 5 seconds. The sampler is initialized based on Fisher estimates. Our results demonstrate LISA capability to measure the two spin magnitudes and the primary spin tilt angle, alongside sky localization, with percent-level precision, while component masses are determined with sub-percent accuracy.</description>

      <title>Jewel Optics I: non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the guilt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enduring technique of aperture masking interferometry, now more than 150 years old, is still widely practised today for it opens a window of high angular resolution astronomy that remains difficult to access by any competing technology. However, the requirement to apodise the pupil into a non-redundant array dramatically limits the throughput, typically to $\sim$10\% or less. This in turn has a dramatic impact on sensitivity, limiting observational reach to only bright science targets. This paper presents "Jewel Optics", a technology that leverages the gains in signal fidelity conferred by non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the sensitivity penalty incurred by traditional aperture masks. Our approach fragments the pupil into several sets of sparse-array non-redundant patterns, each of which is encoded onto a unique phase wedge. After extensive searching, solutions could be found where all individual sets are fully non-redundant while fully tiling the available area of the input pupil. Each pattern is assigned a common phase wedge which diverts light from those sub-apertures onto a unique, defined region of the detector. We demonstrate a prototype designed for use in the VAMPIRES instrument at the Subaru telescope and find excellent agreement between the design and lab results. We discuss a design refinement for producing fully achromatic Jewel Optics, and finally we highlight the potential for future work with these optical components.</description>

      <title>Novel Deep Learning Approach to Detecting Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08429v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has opened up new avenues for exploring and understanding some of the fundamental principles of the universe. The optimal method for detecting modelled gravitational-wave events involves template-based matched filtering and performing a multi-detector coincidence search in the resulting signal-to-noise ratio time series. In recent years, advancements in machine learning and deep learning have led to a flurry of research into using these techniques to replace matched filtering searches and for efficient and robust parameter estimation of the gravitational wave sources. This paper presents a feasibility study for a novel approach to detecting binary black hole gravitational wave signals, which utilizes deep learning techniques on the signal-to-noise ratio time series produced from matched filtering. We show that a deep-learning search can efficiently detect binary black hole gravitational waves from the signal-to-noise ratio time series in simulated Gaussian noise with simulated transient glitches. Furthermore, our search method can outperform a maximum SNR-based matched filtering search on simulated data of the Hanford and Livingston LIGO detectors in the presence of glitches. We further demonstrate that our approach can improve the detection sensitivity for binary black hole mergers at lower masses, relative to a baseline sensitivity of existing search pipelines and deep learning approaches. Lastly, since we are building upon the foundations of a matched filtering search pipeline, we can extract estimates for the signal-to-noise ratio and detector frame chirp mass of a gravitational wave event with similar accuracy as existing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for inverse problems: application to weak lensing mass mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inverse problems, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to obtain error bars with coverage guarantees that are independent of any prior assumptions about the data distribution. In the context of mass mapping, uncertainties could lead to errors that affects our understanding of the underlying mass distribution, or could propagate to cosmological parameter estimation, thereby impacting the precision and reliability of cosmological models. Current surveys, such as Euclid or Rubin, will provide new weak lensing datasets of very high quality. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in mass maps is therefore critical to perform reliable cosmological parameter inference. In this paper, we extend the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm, initially proposed for scalar regression, to inverse problems. We compare our approach with another distribution-free approach based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS). Both methods are based on a calibration dataset, and offer finite-sample coverage guarantees that are independent of the data distribution. Furthermore, they are applicable to any mass mapping method, including blackbox predictors. In our experiments, we apply UQ on three mass-mapping method: the Kaiser-Squires inversion, iterative Wiener filtering, and the MCALens algorithm. Our experiments reveal that RCPS tends to produce overconservative confidence bounds with small calibration sets, whereas CQR is designed to avoid this issue. Although the expected miscoverage rate is guaranteed to stay below a user-prescribed threshold regardless of the mass mapping method, selecting an appropriate reconstruction algorithm remains crucial for obtaining accurate estimates, especially around peak-like structures, which are particularly important for inferring cosmological parameters. Additionally, the choice of mass mapping method influences the size of the error bars.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Detection of Instrumental Glitches in LISA TDI Data</title>

Abstract: The orbiting LISA instrument is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz band, produced by sources including galactic binaries and extreme mass ratio inspirals, among others. The detector consists of three spacecraft, each carrying a pair of free-falling test masses. A technology-demonstration mission, LISA Pathfinder, was launched in 2015, and observed several sudden changes in test mass acceleration, referred to as "glitches." Similar glitches in the full LISA mission have the potential to contaminate the Time-Delay Interferometry outputs that are the detector's primary data product. In this paper, we describe an optimization technique using maximum likelihood estimation for detecting and removing glitches with a known waveform.</description>

      <title>Astronomy and Society: The Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomy, of all the sciences, is possibly the one with the most public appeal across all age groups. This is also evidenced by the existence of a large number of planetaria and amateur astronomy societies, which is unique to the field. Astronomy is known as a `gateway science', with an ability to attract students who then proceed to explore their interest in other STEM fields too. Astronomy's link to society is therefore substantive and diverse. In this white paper, six key areas are analysed, namely outreach and communication, astronomy education, history and heritage, astronomy for development, diversity, and hiring practices for outreach personnel.
  The current status of each of these areas is described, followed by an analysis of what is needed for the future. A set of recommendations for institutions, funding agencies, and individuals are evolved for each specific area. This work charts out the vision for how the astronomy-society connection should take shape in the future, and attempts to provide a road-map for the various stakeholders involved.</description>
