      <title>Neural Network Emulation of Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions at Intermediate Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of new techniques in machine learning are speeding up progress in research in various fields. In this work, we construct and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) to be used within a Bayesian statistical framework as a faster and more reliable alternative to the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator of an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate beam energies. We found strong evidence of DNN being able to emulate the IBUU simulator's prediction on the strengths of protons' directed and elliptical flow very efficiently even with small training datasets and with accuracy about ten times higher than the GP. Limitations of our present work and future improvements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Initial Data for First-order Causal Viscous Conformal Fluids in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the Einstein constraint equations for a first-order causal viscous relativistic hydrodynamic theory in the case of a conformal fluid. For such a theory, a direct application of the conformal method does not lead to a decoupling of the equations, even for constant-mean curvature initial data. We combine the conformal method applied to a background perfect fluid theory with a perturbative argument in order to obtain the result.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the controversy over the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integral along a path in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In this paper, we try to demonstrate that their cancellation argument would not be justified by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of external electromagnetic potential. At the end, we conclude that the failure of the cancellation argument is due to unjustified application of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem to the problem of time-dependent AB-effect.</description>

      <title>Higgs-confinement continuity and matching of Aharonov-Bohm phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some gauge theories with a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry exhibit fractional Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases around vortices in the Higgs regime. We discuss continuity between confining and Higgs regimes in such gauge theories with fundamental matter fields, focusing on the AB phases. By explicit calculations in relevant lattice models, we demonstrate that the AB phase is smoothly connected between the confining and Higgs regimes, supporting the Higgs-confinement continuity. This result provides new insight into phase structures of gauge theories with superfluidity, such as dense QCD.</description>

      <title>Estimation of electric field in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the spacetime profile of the electric field in head-on heavy-ion collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = {\mathcal O}(3 \;-\; 10\;{\rm GeV})$. Using a hadronic cascade model (JAM; Jet AA Microscopic transport model), we numerically demonstrate that the produced field has strength $eE = {\mathcal O}((30 \;-\; 60\;{\rm MeV})^2)$, which is supercritical to the Schwinger limit of QED and is non-negligibly large compared even to the hadron/QCD scale, and survives for a long time $\tau = {\mathcal O}(10\;{\rm fm}/c)$ due to the baryon stopping. We show that the produced field is nonperturbatively strong in the sense that the nonperturbativity parameters (e.g., the Keldysh parameter) are sufficiently large. This is in contrast to high-energy collisions $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \gtrsim 100 \;{\rm GeV}$, where the field is extremely short-lived and hence is perturbative. Our results imply that the electromagnetic field may have phenomenological impacts on hadronic/QCD processes in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions and that heavy-ion collisions can be used as a new tool to explore strong-field physics in the nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>
