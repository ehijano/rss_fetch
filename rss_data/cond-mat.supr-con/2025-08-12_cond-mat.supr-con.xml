      <title>Symmetry-breaking perturbations in the Jahn-Teller-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the multiorbital Hubbard model coupled to anisotropic Jahn-Teller phonons, which is relevant for the description of fulleride superconductors. This system is often approximated by a model with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) Hund's coupling, in which the coupling to the Jahn-Teller phonon is effectively described, but the retardation effect associated with phonon propagation is neglected. We compare the properties of the models with static AFM Hund's coupling and dynamical Jahn-Teller electron-phonon interaction by means of the Eliashberg theory. Considering the susceptibilities for the spin, magnetic orbital, electric orbital, and superconductivity, we reveal a qualitatively different behavior between the two models in the case of the magnetic orbital susceptibility. We further study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet superconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital susceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and retardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low temperatures. By analyzing this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, we clarify that odd-frequency pairs induced by the magnetic field play a crucial role in the spin and orbital magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, the magnetic degrees of freedom produce interesting behaviors in the presence of retardation effects associated with electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>g-Factor Enhanced Upper Critical Field in Superconducting PdTe2 due to Quantum Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pauli limiting field of superconductors determines the maximal possible value of magnetic field at which superconductivity remains possible. For weak-coupling superconductors, it is determined by an established relation that can be found by setting the condensation energy equal to the magnetization free energy. The latter is a function of the carrier g-factor. Here, we demonstrate in a van der Waals superconductor PdTe2, that quantum confinement can tune the effective g-factor causing the Pauli limit to become thickness dependent. We experimentally probe the in-plane upper critical field (Hc2||) of PdTe2 at intermediate thicknesses down to 20mK. Hc2|| is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude as the thickness is varied from 50nm down to 19nm. We model its temperature and thickness dependence, revealing that both orbital and spin Zeeman depairing mechanisms impact its value. While the variation of the orbital interaction is expected, our findings reveal how the Zeeman interaction impacts superconductivity in thin films. They aid in the search for mixed and odd pairing superconductivity where an enhancement of Hc2|| can be occasionally associated with those unconventional pairing symmetries.</description>

      <title>Effect of Josephson junction parameter spread on the performance of SQUID arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions based on grain boundaries, such as those made of Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), exhibit inherent parameter spreads in their critical current and normal state resistance. This variation in junction properties leads to a decrease in array performance for magnetic sensing applications. Therefore, we must develop a quantitative understanding of how junction parameter spreads impact arrays with different designs. In this paper, we use numerical simulations to investigate how the ensemble averaged voltage modulation depth (eta) of one-dimensional SQUID arrays varies with the statistical spread in the junction parameters. In these calculations for arrays we vary the number of junctions, loop inductance and thermal noise strength. We show that eta decreases with increasing spread, and that this reduction is accelerated further by the number of junctions and SQUID cell inductance, but is robust to changes in the thermal noise strength.</description>

      <title>Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov States and Topological Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Altermagnets: an Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical study of the ground-state phase diagram for dilute two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi gases exhibiting $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting under $s$-wave pairing. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field framework, four distinct phases are identified: a Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper-type superfluid, a normal metallic phase, a nodal superfluid with topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (TBFSs), and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states with finite center-of-mass momentum. Among these, the FFLO states and TBFSs exemplify two unconventional forms of superconductivity. Considering the simplicity of this model, with only one band, zero net magnetization, and $s$-wave paring, the emergence of both unconventional phases underscores the pivotal role of altermagnetic spin splitting in enabling exotic pairing phenomena. This analytical study not only offers a valuable benchmark for future numerical simulations, but also provides a concrete experimental roadmap for realizing FFLO states and TBFSs in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Terahertz range polarization rotation in the candidate time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor BiNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the observation of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconductivity in a BiNi bilayer using terahertz (THz) polarimetry. Leveraging a novel high-precision THz polarimetry technique, we detect, in the superconducting state and at zero magnetic field, the smallest polarization rotation of THz light measured to date. By using the MgO substrate itself as an optical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each other. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred microradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with TRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the THz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these low-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the TRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a disordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.</description>

      <title>Topological hydrodynamics in spin-triplet superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Lack of collisional hydrodynamics in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs/Amplitude Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in superconducting chiral topological semimetals with parallel spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to conventional Weyl semimetals in achiral crystals, chiral topological semimetals in chiral crystals exhibit Weyl nodes at time-reversal-invariant momenta. A Fermi surface spin texture with parallel spin-momentum locking in these material has been observed by a recent experiment [Nat. Comm. 15,3720(2024)]. We find that the Weyl nodes location and the Fermi surface spin texture lead to gapped zero-momenta intranode superconductivity (SC), which is absent in achiral Weyl semimetals. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that a cubic lattice system in general favors a mixture of spin-singlet $s_\pm$ and $d+id$-wave pairings. In the presence of only the $s_\pm$-wave pairing, we identify a first-order time-reversal invariant topological SC phase. Notably, an SC phase with two Majorana cones for opened Fermi surfaces is energetically favorable. In addition, a second-order topological superconductor with chiral Majorana states can be realized in the presence of a mixture of $s\pm$- and $d+id$-wave pairing. We show that chiral topological semimetals in cubic lattice are fascinating platforms for exploring intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with Plasma oscillation phase-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + \delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation is be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</description>

Abstract: Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

Abstract: The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material. These include charge density waves, nematic phases, superconducting phases, and pair density waves. In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be transitioned into the superconducting state by applying and subsequently removing a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is possibly a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.</description>
