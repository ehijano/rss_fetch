      <title>Global Gauge Symmetries and Spatial Asymptotic Boundary Conditions in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Yang-Mills gauge theory on a Euclidean Cauchy surface the group of gauge symmetries carrying direct empirical significance is often believed to be $\mathcal{G}_\text{DES}=\mathcal{G}^I/\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$, where $\mathcal{G}^I$ is the group of boundary-preserving gauge symmetries and $\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$ is its subgroup of transformations that are generated by the constraints of the theory. These groups are identified respectively as the gauge transformations that become constant asymptotically and those that become the identity asymptotically. In the Abelian case $G=U(1)$ the quotient is then identified as the group of global gauge symmetries, i.e. $U(1)$ itself. However, known derivations of this claim are imprecise, both mathematically and conceptually. We derive the physical gauge group rigorously for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory. Our main new point is that the requirement to restrict to $\mathcal{G}^I$ does not follow from finiteness of energy only, but from the requirement that the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory be defined on a tangent bundle to configuration space. Moreover, we explain why the quotient consists precisely of a copy of the global gauge group for every homotopy class, even if the various gauge transformations apparently have different asymptotic rates of convergence. Lastly, we consider Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in our framework and show that asymptotic boundary conditions differ in the unbroken and broken phases.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>

      <title>Epistemic-Pragmatist Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics: A Comparative Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate similarities and differences between the main neo-Copenhagen (or "epistemic-pragmatist") interpretations of quantum mechanics, here identified as those defined by the rejection of an ontological nature of the quantum states and the simultaneous avoidance of hidden variables, while maintaining the quantum formalism unchanged. We argue that there is a single general interpretive framework in which the core claims that the various interpretations in the class are committed to, and which they emphasize to varying degrees, can be represented. We also identify, however, remaining differences of a more substantial nature, and we offer a first analysis of them. We also argue that these remaining differences cannot be resolved within the formalism of quantum mechanics itself and identify the more general philosophical considerations that can be used in order to break this interpretation underdetermination.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Between Compatibility and Deterministic Underlying States in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and our ability to create a deterministic underlying-state model for that scenario (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). We first argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system's observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order.</description>
