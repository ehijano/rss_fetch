      <title>RVRAE: A Dynamic Factor Model Based on Variational Recurrent Autoencoder for Stock Returns Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the dynamic factor model has emerged as a dominant tool in economics and finance, particularly for investment strategies. This model offers improved handling of complex, nonlinear, and noisy market conditions compared to traditional static factor models. The advancement of machine learning, especially in dealing with nonlinear data, has further enhanced asset pricing methodologies. This paper introduces a groundbreaking dynamic factor model named RVRAE. This model is a probabilistic approach that addresses the temporal dependencies and noise in market data. RVRAE ingeniously combines the principles of dynamic factor modeling with the variational recurrent autoencoder (VRAE) from deep learning. A key feature of RVRAE is its use of a prior-posterior learning method. This method fine-tunes the model's learning process by seeking an optimal posterior factor model informed by future data. Notably, RVRAE is adept at risk modeling in volatile stock markets, estimating variances from latent space distributions while also predicting returns. Our empirical tests with real stock market data underscore RVRAE's superior performance compared to various established baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Transformer for Times Series: an Application to the S&amp;P500</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer models have been extensively used with good results in a wide area of machine learning applications including Large Language Models and image generation. Here, we inquire on the applicability of this approach to financial time series. We first describe the dataset construction for two prototypical situations: a mean reverting synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on one hand and real S&amp;P500 data on the other hand. Then, we present in detail the proposed Transformer architecture and finally we discuss some encouraging results. For the synthetic data we predict rather accurately the next move, and for the S&amp;P500 we get some interesting results related to quadratic variation and volatility prediction.</description>

      <title>Cyber risk and the cross-section of stock returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract firms' cyber risk with a machine learning algorithm measuring the proximity between their disclosures and a dedicated cyber corpus. Our approach outperforms dictionary methods, uses full disclosure and not devoted-only sections, and generates a cyber risk measure uncorrelated with other firms' characteristics. We find that a portfolio of US-listed stocks in the high cyber risk quantile generates an excess return of 18.72% p.a. Moreover, a long-short cyber risk portfolio has a significant and positive risk premium of 6.93% p.a., robust to all factors' benchmarks. Finally, using a Bayesian asset pricing method, we show that our cyber risk factor is the essential feature that allows any multi-factor model to price the cross-section of stock returns.</description>
