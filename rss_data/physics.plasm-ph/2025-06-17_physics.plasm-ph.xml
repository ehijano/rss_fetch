      <title>Validation of Hermes-3 turbulence simulations against the TCV-X21 diverted L-mode reference case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatic flux-driven turbulence simulations with the Hermes-3 code are performed in TCV L-mode conditions in forward and reversed toroidal field configurations, and compared to the TCV-X21 reference dataset [D.S. Oliveira and T. Body et al. 2022] qualitatively and with a quantitative methodology. Using only the magnetic equilibrium, total power across the separatrix (120kW) and total particle flux to the targets (3e21/s) as inputs, the simulations produce time-averaged plasma profiles in good agreement with experiment. Shifts in the target peak location when the toroidal field direction is reversed are reproduced in simulation, including the experimentally observed splitting of the outer strike point into two density peaks.
  Differences between simulation and experiment include density profiles inside the separatrix and at the inner target in forward (favorable Grad-B) field configuration. These differences in target temperature in forward field configuration lead to differences in the balance of current to the inner and outer divertor in the private flux region. The cause of these differences is most likely the lack of neutral gas in these simulations, indicating that even in low recycling regimes neutral gas plays an important role in determining edge plasma profiles. These conclusions are consistent with findings in [D.S. Oliveira and T. Body et al. 2022].</description>

      <title>Global linear drift-wave eigenmode structures on flux surfaces in stellarators: ion temperature gradient mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent transport greatly impacts the performance of stellarator magnetic confinement devices. While significant progress has been made on the numerical front, theoretical understanding of turbulence in stellarators is still lacking. In particular, due to nonaxisymmetry, different field lines couple within flux surfaces, the effects from which have yet to be adequately studied. In this work, we numerically simulate the linear electrostatic ion-temperature-gradient modes in stellarators using the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC. We find that the linear eigenmode structures are nonuniform on flux surfaces and are localized at the downstream direction of the ion diamagnetic drift. Based on a simple model from Zocco etal [Phys. Plasmas 23, 082516 (2016); 27, 022507 (2020)], we show that the localization can be explained from the nonzero imaginary part of the binormal wavenumber. We further demonstrate that a localized surface-global eigenmode can be constructed from local gyrokinetic codes stella and GX, if we first solve the local dispersion relation with real wavenumbers at each field line, and then do an analytic continuation to the complex-wavenumber plane. These results suggest that the complex-wavenumber spectra from surface-global effects are required to understand linear drift-wave eigenmode structures in stellarators.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Shattered Pellet Injections with Plasmoid Drifts in ASDEX Upgrade and ITER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pellet injection is an important means to fuel and control discharges and mitigate disruptions in reactor-scale fusion devices. To accurately assess the efficiency of these applications, it is necessary to account for the drift of the ablated material toward the low-field side. In this study, we have implemented a semi-analytical model for ablation cloud drifts in the numerical disruption modelling tool DREAM. We show that this model is capable of reproducing the density evolution in shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in ASDEX Upgrade, for model parameters within the expected range. The model is then used to investigate the prospects for disruption mitigation by staggered SPIs in 15 MA DT H-mode ITER scenarios. We find that the drifts may decrease the assimilation of pure deuterium SPIs by about an order of magnitude, which may be important to consider when designing the disruption mitigation scheme in ITER. The ITER scenarios studied here generally result in similar multi-MA runaway electron (RE) currents, regardless of the drift assumptions, but the effect of the drift is larger in situations with a fast and early thermal quench. The RE current may also be more strongly affected by the drift losses when accounting for RE losses caused by the vertical plasma motion.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction-free magnetic control of DIII-D plasma with deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of plasma shape and position is essential for stable tokamak operation and achieving commercial fusion energy. Traditional control methods rely on equilibrium reconstruction and linearized models, limiting adaptability and real-time performance. Here,the first application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for magnetic plasma control on the mid-size DIII-D tokamak is presented, demonstrating a nonlinear approach that improves robustness and flexibility across plasma scenarios. Using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, this method eliminates the need for equilibrium reconstruction, enabling high-speed control execution and scalability on larger fusion devices. NSFsim, a 2D Grad-Shafranov equilibration solver with a circuit equation and a 1D transport solver, is used to train the agent. Its capability of reproducing the kinetic parameter evolution alongside magnetic equilibria evolution appears to be an essential factor significantly affecting control quality. RL-based controllers demonstrated robust magnetic control in experimental application at DIII-D, preserving control performance in transient events during plasma discharges, and reaching target parameters from the first discharge without additional tuning or modifications. The approach itself has significant generalization potential across devices and targets. This work represents a step toward AI-driven, real-time plasma control, advancing the feasibility of next-generation fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>The bump-on-tail instability excited by energetic electrons in helicon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores for the first time bump-on-tail (BOT) instability excited by energetic electrons in helicon plasma. The Berk-Breizman model that developed for the wave-particle interaction and resulted instability in magnetic fusion is used. Details of the BOT instability are computed referring to typical helicon discharge conditions. Parameter studies are also conducted to reveal the effects of collisionality and energetic drive, to account for high-pressure and high-power senarios respectively. It is found that under the HXHM (high magnetic field helicon experiment) experimental parameters, the disturbed distribution function oscillates explosively at the initial stage of BOT instability excitation, and the wave frequency shift does not appear, i.e., the steady-state solution always exists under this mode. In the process of restoring stability, the exchange of energetic particles and wave energy is concurrent with the change of wave amplitude. As the Krook operator increases (i.e., from 0.1 to 1), the saturation level of the electric field and the instability enhance. Additionally, there have a bigger disturbance for the initial EEDF (electron energy distribution function) in high-power helicon devices, so that the energy exchange between waves and energetic particles is stronger as well. Moreover, BOT instability effects the density and flux of bulk plasma, and the flux increases with the Krook operator. The effect of BOT instability is one order of magnitude larger on rotating plasma than that on stationary plasma.These findings present a full picture of BOT instability in helicon plasma and are valuable to controlling it for efficient and safe applications, e.g., high-power space plasma propulsion and plasma material interactions using helicon source.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for the enhancement of fusion reactivity by turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactivity of fusion plasma depends not only on its local density and temperature but also, through a recently identified kinetic effect, on the relative velocities of nearby fluid elements. Turbulence on fine spatial scales therefore enhances fusion reactivity. The enhancement is quantified here for general subsonic turbulent flows. Leveraging this effect in the design of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments could enable substantial energy savings.</description>

      <title>Thermo-mechanic invariant in anisotropic plasma with heat fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate linear perturbations in an incompressible, weakly collisional, anisotropic plasma, taking heat fluxes into account. Our analysis identifies a new class of time-invariant perturbations that encompass heat flux variations and aperiodic longitudinal perturbations in the magnetic field and flow velocity. Under the Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) approximation, which neglects low-frequency heat flux effects, these perturbations are purely thermal and decoupled from magnetic and velocity fields. When heat fluxes are included, these perturbations gain kinematic and magnetic components, leading to the identification of a ``thermo-mechanic mode.''
  The nature of aperiodic linear modes suggests that they may reach higher amplitudes in perturbation structures, that can be revealed as filamentary formations. We discuss the potential implications of these filaments on the large-scale dynamics of flows and on the nonlinear energy balance within small-scale MHD turbulence. Our findings indicate that thermo-mechanic invariant may play a significant role in modulating turbulence energy transfer dynamics, potentially impacting both local and global flow behavior in weakly collisional anisotropic plasmas.</description>

      <title>An upper pressure limit for low-Z benign termination of runaway electron beams in TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model for the particle balance in the post-disruption runaway electron plateau phase of a tokamak discharge. The model is constructed with the help of, and applied to, experimental data from TCV discharges investigating the so-called ``low-Z benign termination'' runaway electron mitigation scheme. In the benign termination scheme, the free electron density is first reduced in order for a subsequently induced MHD instability to grow rapidly and spread the runaway electrons widely across the wall. We show that the observed non-monotonic dependence of the free electron density with the measured neutral pressure is due to plasma re-ionization induced by runaway electron impact ionization. At higher neutral pressures, more target particles are present in the plasma for runaway electrons to collide with and ionize. Parameter scans are conducted to clarify the role of the runaway electron density and energy on the free electron density, and it is found that only the runaway electron density has a noticeable impact. While the free electron density is shown to be related to the spread of heat fluxes at termination, the exact cause for the upper neutral pressure limit remains undetermined and an object for further study.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis and Parallel Scaling Study of A Parareal Parallel-in-Time Integration Algorithm for Particle-in-Fourier Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a parareal based time parallelization scheme in the phase-space for the particle-in-Fourier (PIF) discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson system used in kinetic plasma simulations. We use PIF with a coarse tolerance for the nonuniform fast Fourier transforms, or the standard particle-in-cell scheme, combined with temporal coarsening, as coarse propagators. This is different from the typical spatial coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes for parareal, which are not possible or effective for PIF schemes. We perform an error analysis of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau damping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also implement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source, performance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100 GPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization utilizing the parareal algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to $4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a push rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma mini-apps considered.</description>
