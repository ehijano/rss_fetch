      <title>Centralized Health and Exposomic Resource (C-HER): Analytic and AI-Ready Data for External Exposomic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Centralized Health and Exposomic Resource (C-HER) project has identified, profiled, spatially indexed, and stored over 30 external exposomic datasets. The resulting analytic and AI-ready data (AAIRD) provides a significant opportunity to develop an integrated picture of the exposome for health research. The exposome is a conceptual framework designed to guide the study of the complex environmental and genetic factors that together shape human health. Few composite measures of the exposome exist due to the high dimensionality of exposure data, multimodal data sources, and varying spatiotemporal scales. We develop a data engineering solution that overcomes the challenges of spatio-temporal linkage in this field. We provide examples of how environmental data can be combined to characterize a region, model air pollution, or provide indicators for cancer research. The development of AAIRD will allow future studies to use ML and deep learning methods to generate spatial and contextual exposure data for disease prediction.</description>

      <title>Transportability of Prognostic Markers: Rethinking Common Practices through a Sufficient-Component-Cause Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportability, the ability to maintain performance across populations, is a desirable property of of markers of clinical outcomes. However, empirical findings indicate that markers often exhibit varying performances across populations. For prognostic markers whose results are used to quantify of the risk of an outcome, oftentimes a form of updating is required when the marker is transported to populations with different disease prevalences. Here, we revisit transportability of prognostic markers through the lens of the foundational framework of sufficient component causes (SCC). We argue that transporting a marker "as is" implicitly assumes predictive values are transportable, whereas conventional prevalence-adjustment shifts the locus of transportability to accuracy metrics (sensitivity and specificity). Using a minimalist SCC framework that decomposes risk prediction into its causal constituents, we show that both approaches rely on strong assumptions about the stability of cause distributions across populations. A SCC framework instead invites making transparent assumptions about how different causes vary across populations, leading to different transportation methods. For example, in the absence of any external information other than disease prevalence, a cause-neutral perspective can assume all causes are responsible for change in prevalence, leading to a new form of marker transportation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that different transportability assumptions lead to varying degrees of information loss, depending on how population differ from each other in the distribution of causes. A SCC perspective challenges common assumptions and practices for marker transportability, and proposes transportation algorithms that reflect our knowledge or assumptions about how causes vary across populations.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Safety Stock Dimensioning: A Data-Driven Approach for Supply Chains of Hardware OEMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilient supply chains are critical, especially for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that power today's digital economy. Safety Stock dimensioning-the computation of the appropriate safety stock quantity-is one of several mechanisms to ensure supply chain resiliency, as it protects the supply chain against demand and supply uncertainties. Unfortunately, the major approaches to dimensioning safety stock heavily assume that demand is normally distributed and ignore future demand variability, limiting their applicability in manufacturing contexts where demand is non-normal, intermittent, and highly skewed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that relaxes the assumption of normality, enabling the demand distribution of each inventory item to be analytically determined using Kernel Density Estimation. Also, we extended the analysis from historical demand variability to forecasted demand variability. We evaluated the proposed approach against a normal distribution model in a near-world inventory replenishment simulation. Afterwards, we used a linear optimization model to determine the optimal safety stock configuration. The results from the simulation and linear optimization models showed that the data-driven approach outperformed traditional approaches. In particular, the data-driven approach achieved the desired service levels at lower safety stock levels than the conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Dynamic causal discovery in Alzheimer's disease through latent pseudotime modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC 0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers, enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</description>

      <title>Applying Time Series Deep Learning Models to Forecast the Growth of Perennial Ryegrass in Ireland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grasslands, constituting the world's second-largest terrestrial carbon sink, play a crucial role in biodiversity and the regulation of the carbon cycle. Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we propose deep learning models tailored for univariate datasets, presenting cost-effective alternatives. Notably, a temporal convolutional network designed for forecasting Perennial Ryegrass growth in Cork exhibits high performance, leveraging historical grass height data with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46. Validation across a comprehensive dataset spanning 1,757 weeks over 34 years provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming practices.</description>

      <title>Bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion Surrogate with Active Learning for Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF) simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error, estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression. New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Compound Flood Risk and Transition Zones via an Extended Joint Probability Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound flooding from the combined effects of extreme storm surge, rainfall, and river flows poses significant risks to infrastructure and communities -- as demonstrated by hurricanes Isaac and Harvey. Yet, existing methods to quantify compound flood risk lack a unified probabilistic basis. Copula-based models capture the co-occurrence of flood drivers but not the likelihood of the flood response, while coupled hydrodynamic models simulate interactions but lack a probabilistic characterization of compound flood extremes. The Joint Probability Method (JPM), the foundation of coastal surge risk analysis, has never been formally extended to incorporate hydrologic drivers -- leaving a critical gap in quantifying compound flood risk and the statistical structure of compound flood transition zones (CFTZs). Here, we extend the JPM theory to hydrologic processes for quantifying the likelihood of compound flood depths across both tropical and non-tropical storms. This extended methodology incorporates rainfall fields, antecedent soil moisture, and baseflow alongside coastal storm surge, enabling: (1) a statistical description of the flood depth as the response to the joint distribution of hydrologic and coastal drivers, (2) a statistical delineation of the CFTZ based on exceedance probabilities, and (3) a systematic identification of design storms for specified return period flood depths, moving beyond design based solely on driver likelihoods. We demonstrate this method around Lake Maurepas, Louisiana. Results show a CFTZ more than double the area of prior event-specific delineations, with compound interactions increasing flood depths by up to 2.25 feet. This extended JPM provides a probabilistic foundation for compound flood risk assessment and planning.</description>

      <title>The Human Flourishing Geographic Index: A County-Level Dataset for the United States, 2013--2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators. Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States over the past decade.</description>

      <title>Sub-exponential Growth in Online Word Usage: A Piecewise Power-Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of sub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in epidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that about 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well captured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the duration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with strangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.</description>

      <title>Assessing Replicability Across Dependent Studies: A Framework for Testing Partial Conjunction Hypotheses with Application to GWAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replicability is central to scientific progress, and the partial conjunction (PC) hypothesis testing framework provides an objective tool to quantify it across disciplines. Existing PC methods assume independent studies. Yet many modern applications, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sample overlap, violate this assumption, leading to dependence among study-specific summary statistics. Failure to account for this dependence can drastically inflate type I errors when combining inferences. We propose e-Filter, a powerful procedure grounded on the theory of e-values. It involves a filtering step that retains a set of the most promising PC hypotheses, and a selection step where PC hypotheses from the filtering step are marked as discoveries whenever their e-values exceed a selection threshold. We establish the validity of e-Filter for FWER and FDR control under unknown study dependence. A comprehensive simulation study demonstrates its excellent power gains over competing methods. We apply e-Filter to a GWAS replicability study to identify consistent genetic signals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Here, the participating studies exhibit varying levels of sample overlap, rendering existing methods unsuitable for combining inferences. A subsequent pathway enrichment analysis shows that e-Filter replicated signals achieve stronger statistical enrichment on biologically relevant LDL-C pathways than competing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used in a number of clinical applications, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, monitoring of disease development, and treatment effect evaluation. Statistical modeling of PET imaging is essential to address continually emerging scientific questions in these research fields, including hypotheses related to evaluation of effects of disease modifying treatments on amyloid reduction in AD and associations between amyloid reduction and cognitive function, among many others. In this paper, we provide background information and tools for statisticians interested in developing statistical models for PET imaging to pre-process and prepare data for analysis. We introduce our novel pre-processing and visualization tool TRAECR (Template registration, MRI-PET co-Registration, Anatomical brain Extraction and COMBAT/RAVEL harmonization) to facilitate data preparation for statistical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bitumen extraction for the production of synthetic crude oil in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands industry has recently come under spotlight for being a significant source of greenhouse gas emission. A major cause of concern is methane, a greenhouse gas produced by the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in oil sands residues, or tailings, stored in settle basins commonly known as oil sands tailing ponds. In order to determine the methane emitting potential of these tailing ponds and have future methane projections, we use real-time weather data, mechanistic models developed from laboratory controlled experiments, and industrial reports to train a physics constrained machine learning model. Our trained model can successfully identify the directions of active ponds and estimate their emission levels, which are generally hard to obtain due to data sampling restrictions. We found that each active oil sands tailing pond could emit between 950 to 1500 tonnes of methane per year, whose environmental impact is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from at least 6000 gasoline powered vehicles. Although abandoned ponds are often presumed to have insignificant emissions, our findings indicate that these ponds could become active over time and potentially emit up to 1000 tonnes of methane each year. Taking an average over all datasets that was used in model training, we estimate that emissions around major oil sands regions would need to be reduced by approximately 12% over a year, to reduce the average methane concentrations to 2005 levels.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Model Approach for Estimating Regional Functional Connectivity from Voxel-level BOLD Signals</title>

Abstract: Resting-state brain functional connectivity quantifies the synchrony between activity patterns of different brain regions. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), each region comprises a set of spatially contiguous voxels at which blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals are acquired. The ubiquitous Correlation of Averages (CA) estimator, and other similar metrics, are computed from spatially aggregated signals within each region, and remain the quantifications of inter-regional connectivity most used by neuroscientists despite their bias that stems from intra-regional correlation and measurement error. We leverage the framework of linear mixed-effects models to isolate different sources of variability in the voxel-level signals, including both inter-regional and intra-regional correlation and measurement error. A novel computational pipeline, focused on subject-level inter-regional correlation parameters of interest, is developed to address the challenges of applying maximum (or restricted maximum) likelihood estimation to such structured, high-dimensional spatiotemporal data. Simulation results demonstrate the reliability of correlation estimates and their large sample standard error approximations, and their superiority relative to CA. The proposed method is applied to two public fMRI data sets. First, we analyze scans of a dead rat to assess false positive performance when connectivity is absent. Second, individual human brain networks are constructed for subjects from a Human Connectome Project test-retest database. Concordance between inter-regional correlation estimates for test-retest scans of the same subject are shown to be higher for the proposed method relative to CA.</description>

Abstract: A novel procedure is presented for finding the true but latent endpoints within the repayment histories of individual loans. The monthly observations beyond these true endpoints are false, largely due to operational failures that delay account closure, thereby corrupting some loans. Detecting these false observations is difficult at scale since each affected loan history might have a different sequence of trailing zero (or very small) month-end balances. Identifying these trailing balances requires an exact definition of a "small balance", which our method informs. We demonstrate this procedure and isolate the ideal small-balance definition using two different South African datasets. Evidently, corrupted loans are remarkably prevalent and have excess histories that are surprisingly long, which ruin the timing of risk events and compromise any subsequent time-to-event model, e.g., survival analysis. Having discarded these excess histories, we demonstrably improve the accuracy of both the predicted timing and severity of risk events, without materially impacting the portfolio. The resulting estimates of credit losses are lower and less biased, which augurs well for raising accurate credit impairments under IFRS 9. Our work therefore addresses a pernicious data error, which highlights the pivotal role of data preparation in producing credible forecasts of credit risk.</description>

      <title>A comparison between copula-based, mixed model, and estimating equation methods for regression of bivariate correlated data</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation study comparing the performance of generalized joint regression models (GJRM) with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and generalized estimating equations (GEE) for regression of longitudinal data with two measurements per observational unit. We compare models on the basis of overall fit, coefficient accuracy and computational complexity.
  We find that for the normal model with identity link, all models provide accurate estimates of regression coefficients with comparable fit. However, for non-normal marginal distributions and when a non-identity link function is used, we highlight a major pitfall in the use of GLMMs: without significant adjustment they provide highly biased estimates of marginal coefficients and often provide extreme fits. GLMM coefficient bias and relative lack of fit is more pronounced when the marginal distributions are more skewed or highly correlated. In addition, we find major discrepancies between the estimates from different GLMM software implementations. In contrast, we find that GJRM provides unbiased estimates across all distributions with accurate standard errors when the copula is correctly specified; and the GJRM provides a model fit favourable or comparable to GLMMs and GEEs in almost all cases. We also compare the approaches for a real-world longitudinal study of doctor visits.
  We conclude that for non-normal bivariate data, the GJRM provides a superior model with more consistently accurate and interpretable coefficients than the GLMM, and better or comparable fit than both the GLMM and GEE, while providing more flexibility in choice of marginal distributions, and control over correlation structure.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover effects: Airstrikes and insurgent violence in the Iraq War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social scientists now routinely draw on high-frequency, high-granularity ''microlevel'' data to estimate the causal effects of subnational interventions. To date, most researchers aggregate these data into panels, often tied to large-scale administrative units. This approach has two limitations. First, data (over)aggregation obscures valuable spatial and temporal information, heightening the risk of mistaken inferences. Second, existing panel approaches either ignore spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects completely or impose overly restrictive assumptions. We introduce a general methodological framework and an accompanying open-source R package, geocausal, that enable spatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover effects. Using this framework, we demonstrate how to define and estimate causal quantities of interest, explore heterogeneous treatment effects, conduct causal mediation analysis, and perform data visualization. We apply our methodology to the Iraq War (2003-11), where we reexamine long-standing questions about the effects of airstrikes on insurgent violence.</description>

      <title>Assessing Risk Heterogeneity through Heavy-Tailed Frequency and Severity Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of risk typically involves dividing a random damage-generation process into separate frequency (event-count) and severity (damage-magnitude) components. In the present article, we construct canonical families of mixture distributions for each of these components, based on a Negative Binomial kernel for frequencies and a Gamma kernel for severities. These mixtures are employed to assess the heterogeneity of risk factors underlying an empirical distribution through the shape of the implied mixing distribution. From the duality of the Negative Binomial and Gamma distributions, we first derive necessary and sufficient conditions for heavy-tailed (i.e., inverse power-law) canonical mixtures. We then formulate flexible 4-parameter families of mixing distributions for Geometric and Exponential kernels to generate heavy-tailed 4-parameter mixture models, and extend these mixtures to arbitrary Negative Binomial and Gamma kernels, respectively, yielding 5-parameter mixtures for detecting and measuring risk heterogeneity. To check the robustness of such heterogeneity inferences, we show how a fitted 5-parameter model may be re-expressed in terms of alternative Negative Binomial or Gamma kernels whose associated mixing distributions form a "calibrated" family.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</description>
