      <title>Longitudinal market structure detection using a dynamic modularity-spectral algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Modularity-Spectral Algorithm (DynMSA), a novel approach to identify clusters of stocks with high intra-cluster correlations and low inter-cluster correlations by combining Random Matrix Theory with modularity optimisation and spectral clustering. The primary objective is to uncover hidden market structures and find diversifiers based on return correlations, thereby achieving a more effective risk-reducing portfolio allocation. We applied DynMSA to constituents of the S&amp;P 500 and compared the results to sector- and market-based benchmarks. Besides the conception of this algorithm, our contributions further include implementing a sector-based calibration for modularity optimisation and a correlation-based distance function for spectral clustering. Testing revealed that DynMSA outperforms baseline models in intra- and inter-cluster correlation differences, particularly over medium-term correlation look-backs. It also identifies stable clusters and detects regime changes due to exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Portfolios constructed using our clusters showed higher Sortino and Sharpe ratios, lower downside volatility, reduced maximum drawdown and higher annualised returns compared to an equally weighted market benchmark.</description>

      <title>Cost-efficiency in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the topic of cost-efficiency in incomplete markets. A payoff is called cost-efficient if it achieves a given probability distribution at some given investment horizon with a minimum initial budget. Extensive literature exists for the case of a complete financial market. We show how the problem can be extended to incomplete markets and how the main results from the theory of complete markets still hold in adapted form. In particular, we find that in incomplete markets, the optimal portfolio choice for non-decreasing preferences that are diversification-loving (a notion introduced in this paper) must be "perfectly" cost-efficient. This notion of perfect cost-efficiency is shown to be equivalent to the fact that the payoff can be rationalized, i.e., it is the solution to an expected utility problem.</description>

      <title>An extended Merton problem with relaxed benchmark tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a Merton's optimal consumption problem in an extended formulation incorporating the tracking of a benchmark process described by a geometric Brownian motion. We consider a relaxed tracking formulation such that the wealth process compensated by a fictitious capital injection outperforms the benchmark at all times. The fund manager aims to maximize the expected utility of consumption deducted by the cost of the capital injection, where the latter term can also be regarded as the expected largest shortfall of the wealth with reference to the benchmark. By introducing an auxiliary state process with reflection, we formulate and tackle an equivalent stochastic control problem by means of the dual transform and probabilistic representation, where the dual PDE can be solved explicitly. On the strength of the closed-form results, we can derive and verify the optimal feedback control for the primal control problem, allowing us to discuss some new and interesting financial implications induced by the additional risk-taking from the capital injection and the goal of tracking.</description>
