      <title>Novel Approximation of the Modified Mild Slope Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mild-slope equation and its various modifications aim to model, with varying degrees of success, linear water wave propagation over sloping or undulating seabed topography. However, despite multiple modifications and attempted simplifications, the different variants of the equation include multiple higher order terms involving the nonlinear water wave dispersion relation and thus remain analytic intractable. To further facilitate its use, we derive a drastically simplified alternative version of the modified mild-slope equation that bears striking resemblance to the linear shallow water equation while retaining all critical features of the original equation that enable it to be valid for a wide range of wave numbers and water depths. Direct comparison of the modified mild-slope equation and our simplified formulation indicates that the simplified equations agree with the modified mild slope equation at leading orders in the forcing frequency and local depth. Validations with multiple sets of benchmark wave scattering problems demonstrate that despite the clearly reduced complexity, the simplified equations were able to replicate the predictions of the modified mild slope equations over a wide range of wave numbers and surface topographies, including higher order resonant conditions.</description>

      <title>Hurricane Impact Index for Assessing Direct and Indirect Hazards in Central America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hurricanes rank among the most destructive natural hazards. They are complex phenomena that can cause both direct damage along their path and indirect impacts due to heavy rainfall and strong winds, with effects varying according to regional topography. In this paper, we propose a Hurricane Impact Index to assess both direct and indirect hazards, and we demonstrate its applicability to the Central American region. The index is constructed so that we can decompose these effects across multiple dimensions of time and space, enabling a detailed analysis of the intensity and distribution of hurricane impacts.</description>

      <title>SPP location with spherical ray tracing by refractive index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric layer structure is a primary factor affecting the precision of single-point satellite positioning. The assumption of electromagnetic wave rectilinear propagation hinders the accurate implementation of ionospheric and tropospheric corrections, whereas curvilinear positioning methods fully account for ray deflection. This study aims to derive partial derivative formulas for theoretical travel time with respect to latitude, longitude, elevation, and velocity models by formulating electromagnetic wave travel time equations under a coordinate-based one-dimensional layered velocity model. Subsequently, a linearized LSQR method is employed to invert station coordinates, receiver clock biases, and electromagnetic wave velocities at the bottom of the ionosphere and troposphere using over six sets of observations. This replaces conventional ionospheric/tropospheric pseudorange corrections in single-point positioning, establishing a novel spherical coordinate refraction travel time positioning method. The classical straight-line pseudorange positioning is reformulated into a time-of-flight positioning approach, and the positioning accuracy differences between straight-line and spherical coordinate refraction travel time methods are compared. By integrating classical ionospheric and tropospheric models to construct corresponding refractive index models and combining them with curvilinear ray tracing methods, the inherent theoretical limitations of positioning can be effectively mitigated.</description>

      <title>Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount.

      <title>Earth's Infrared Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like Johnson noise, where the thermal fluctuations of charge carriers in a resistor lead to current fluctuations, the internal variability of Earth's atmosphere leads to fluctuations in the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) emitted to space, creating "Earth's Infrared Background" (EIB). We identify the background with spatially isotropic, random variability consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It allows one to distinguish it from atmospheric variability on preferred spatiotemporal scales, including the annual/seasonal/daily cycles, waves, storms, and other coherent modes. Thus, like the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), where anisotropies in the microwave radiation represent features of interest in the Universe, anisotropies in the OLR represent features of interest in Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the CMB, which represents a snapshot of the early Universe, the EIB represents Earth's climate in (quasi-) steady state and is therefore described by its spatiotemporal variability. By fitting the OLR from satellite observations to a stochastically forced $\varepsilon$nergy balance climate model, we find that the EIB consists of random fluctuations with a standard deviation of 26.5 W m$^{-2}$, compared to the mean 240 W m$^{-2}$ flux emitted to space. These fluctuations have a red spectrum in both space and time with an upper bound of 400 km and 2.5 days on their spatiotemporal decorrelation, between meso-scale and synoptic-scale weather.</description>

      <title>Supporting renewable energy planning and operation with data-driven high-resolution ensemble weather forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information. Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained, full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member, 10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes &lt; 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.</description>
