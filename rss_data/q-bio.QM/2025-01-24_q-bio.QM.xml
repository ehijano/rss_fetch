      <title>Derivation from kinetic theory and 2-D pattern analysis of chemotaxis models for Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of reaction-diffusion equations for Multiple Sclerosis is presented. These models are derived by means of a diffusive limit starting from a proper kinetic description, taking account of the underlying microscopic interactions among cells. At the macroscopic level, we discuss the necessary conditions for Turing instability phenomena and the formation of two-dimensional patterns, whose shape and stability are investigated by means of a weakly nonlinear analysis. Some numerical simulations, confirming and extending theoretical results, are proposed for a specific scenario.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of biological systems now and then: revisiting tools and visions from the beginning of the century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, computational modelling of biological systems has evolved remarkably and sees matured use spanning basic and clinical research. While the topic of the peri-millennial debate about the virtues and limitations of 'reductionism and integrationism' seems less controversial today, a new apparent dichotomy dominates discussions: mechanistic vs. data-driven modelling. In light of this distinction, we provide an overview of recent achievements and new challenges with a focus on the cardiovascular system. Attention has shifted from generating a universal model of the human to either models of individual humans (digital twins) or entire cohorts of models representative of clinical populations to enable in silico clinical trials. Disease-specific parameterisation, inter-individual and intra-individual variability, uncertainty quantification as well as interoperable, standardised, and quality-controlled data are important issues today, which call for open tools, data and metadata standards, as well as strong community interactions. The quantitative, biophysical, and highly controlled approach provided by in silico methods has become an integral part of physiological and medical research. In silico methods have the potential to accelerate future progress also in the fields of integrated multi-physics modelling, multi-scale models, virtual cohort studies, and machine learning beyond what is feasible today. In fact, mechanistic and data-driven modelling can complement each other synergistically and fuel tomorrow's artificial intelligence applications to further our understanding of physiology and disease mechanisms, to generate new hypotheses and assess their plausibility, and thus to contribute to the evolution of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between small and large scales movements in a neotropical small mammal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We record and analyze the movement patterns of the marsupial {\it Didelphis aurita} at different temporal scales. Animals trajectories are collected at a daily scale by using spool-and-line techniques, and with the help of radio-tracking devices animals traveled distances are estimated at intervals of weeks. Small-scale movements are well described by truncated L\'evy flight, while large-scale movements produce a distribution of distances which is compatible with a Brownian motion. A model of the movement behavior of these animals, based on a truncated L\'evy flight calibrated on the small scale data, converges towards a Brownian behavior after a short time interval of the order of one week. These results show that whether L\'evy flight or Brownian motion behaviors apply, will depend on the scale of aggregation of the animals paths. In this specific case, as the effect of the rude truncation present in the daily data generates a fast convergence towards Brownian behaviors, L\'evy flights become of scarce interest for describing the local dispersion properties of these animals, which result well approximated by a normal diffusion process and not a fast, anomalous one. Interestingly, we are able to describe two movement phases as the consequence of a statistical effect generated by aggregation, without the necessity of introducing ecological constraints or mechanisms operating at different spatio-temporal scales. This result is of general interest, as it can be a key element for describing movement phenomenology at distinct spatio-temporal scales across different taxa and in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Exercise and Feedback System for Social Healthcare using LLMOps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the growing demand for personalized feedback in healthcare platforms and social communities by introducing an LLMOps-based system for automated exercise analysis and personalized recommendations. Current healthcare platforms rely heavily on manual analysis and generic health advice, limiting user engagement and health promotion effectiveness. We developed a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to automatically analyze user activity data from the "Ounwan" exercise recording community. The system integrates LLMOps with LLM APIs, containerized infrastructure, and CI/CD practices to efficiently process large-scale user activity data, identify patterns, and generate personalized recommendations. The architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and security for large-scale healthcare communities. Evaluation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in three key metrics: exercise classification, duration prediction, and caloric expenditure estimation. This approach improves the efficiency of community management while providing more accurate and personalized feedback to users, addressing the limitations of traditional manual analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Redefining Influenza Transmission Seasonality Using the Novel Seasonality Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of climate conditions on influenza epidemiology has mostly been studied by addressing a singular aspect of transmission and a climate variable correlating to it. As climate change unfolds at an unprecedented rate, we urgently need new multidisciplinary approaches that can embrace complexity of disease transmission in the fast-changing environment and help us better understand the implications for health. In this study, we have implemented a novel seasonality index to capture a vast network of climate, infectious, and socio-behavioural mechanisms influencing a seasonal influenza epidemic. We hypothesize that intricate, region-specific behavioural patterns are cross regulating the influenza spreading and dynamics of epidemics with changes in meteorological conditions within a specific season. To better understand the phenomena, we analysed weekly surveillance data from temperate European countries and redefined seasonal transitions using the seasonality index. This approach allowed us to characterize influenza seasonality more accurately in relation to specific atmospheric conditions. Key findings include: i) a strong correlation between influenza infection rates and the seasonality index across different climate zones and social groups, and ii) a high linear correlation between winter duration, determined by the seasonality index, and the time scale of low-frequency peaks in the infection rates power spectral density.</description>

      <title>Reaction kinetics of membrane receptors: a spatial modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between diffusing molecules and membrane-bound receptors drive numerous cellular processes. In this work, we develop a spatial model of molecular interactions with membrane receptors by homogenizing the cell membrane and describing the evolution of both molecular diffusion and molecule-receptor interactions. By analyzing a resulting partial differential equation coupled to ordinary differential equations, we derive analytical expressions for the steady-state molecular influx rate in four prototypical interaction scenarios: Michaelis-Menten kinetics, Substrate Competition, Competitive Inhibition, and Uncompetitive Inhibition. For each scenario, we show how to modify the classical well-mixed reaction rate theory to resolve spatial features inherent to receptors bound to cell membranes. We find that naive well-mixed calculations significantly overestimate reaction rates in certain biophysical parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>SequenceLab: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Computational Methods for Comparing Genomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16908v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational complexity is a key limitation of genomic analyses. Thus, over the last 30 years, researchers have proposed numerous fast heuristic methods that provide computational relief. Comparing genomic sequences is one of the most fundamental computational steps in most genomic analyses. Due to its high computational complexity, optimized exact and heuristic algorithms are still being developed. We find that these methods are highly sensitive to the underlying data, its quality, and various hyperparameters. Despite their wide use, no in-depth analysis has been performed, potentially falsely discarding genetic sequences from further analysis and unnecessarily inflating computational costs. We provide the first analysis and benchmark of this heterogeneity. We deliver an actionable overview of the 11 most widely used state-of-the-art methods for comparing genomic sequences. We also inform readers about their advantages and downsides using thorough experimental evaluation and different real datasets from all major manufacturers (i.e., Illumina, ONT, and PacBio).

      <title>MetaTrinity: Enabling Fast Metagenomic Classification via Seed Counting and Edit Distance Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02029v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metagenomics, the study of genome sequences of diverse organisms cohabiting in a shared environment, has experienced significant advancements across various medical and biological fields. Metagenomic analysis is crucial, for instance, in clinical applications such as infectious disease screening and the diagnosis and early detection of diseases such as cancer. A key task in metagenomics is to determine the species present in a sample and their relative abundances. Currently, the field is dominated by either alignment-based tools, which offer high accuracy but are computationally expensive, or alignment-free tools, which are fast but lack the needed accuracy for many applications. In response to this dichotomy, we introduce MetaTrinity, a tool based on heuristics, to achieve a fundamental improvement in accuracy-runtime tradeoff over existing methods. We benchmark MetaTrinity against two leading metagenomic classifiers, each representing different ends of the performance-accuracy spectrum. On one end, Kraken2, a tool optimized for performance, shows modest accuracy yet a rapid runtime. The other end of the spectrum is governed by Metalign, a tool optimized for accuracy. Our evaluations show that MetaTrinity achieves an accuracy comparable to Metalign while gaining a 4x speedup without any loss in accuracy. This directly equates to a fourfold improvement in runtime-accuracy tradeoff. Compared to Kraken2, MetaTrinity requires a 5x longer runtime yet delivers a 17x improvement in accuracy. This demonstrates a 3.4x enhancement in the accuracy-runtime tradeoff for MetaTrinity. This dual comparison positions MetaTrinity as a broadly applicable solution for metagenomic classification, combining advantages of both ends of the spectrum: speed and accuracy. MetaTrinity is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/MetaTrinity.</description>

      <title>Growth-rate distributions of gut microbiota time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logarithmic growth-rates are fundamental observables for describing ecological systems and the characterization of their distributions with analytical techniques can greatly improve their comprehension. Here a neutral model based on a stochastic differential equation with demographic noise, which presents a closed form for these distributions, is used to describe the population dynamics of microbiota. Results show that this model can successfully reproduce the log-growth rate distribution of the considered abundance time-series. More significantly, it predicts its temporal dependence, by reproducing its kurtosis evolution when the time lag $\tau$ is increased. Furthermore, its typical shape for large $\tau$ is assessed, verifying that the distribution variance does not diverge with $\tau$. The simulated processes generated by the calibrated stochastic equation and the analysis of each time-series, taken one by one, provided additional support for our approach. Alternatively, we tried to describe our dataset by using a logistic neutral model with an environmental stochastic term. Analytical and numerical results show that this model is not suited for describing the leptokurtic log-growth rates distribution found in our data. These results support an effective neutral model with demographic stochasticity for describing the considered microbiota.</description>
