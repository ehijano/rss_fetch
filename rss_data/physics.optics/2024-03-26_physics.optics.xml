      <title>Flat band fine-tuning and its photonic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands - single-particle energy bands - in tight-binding networks have attracted attention due to the presence of macroscopic degeneracies and their extreme sensitivity to perturbations. This makes them natural candidates for emerging exotic phases and unconventional orders. The challenging part however is to construct flat band networks, whose existence relies on symmetries and fine-tuning. In this review we consider the recently proposed systematic ways to construct flat band networks based on symmetries or fine-tuning. We then discuss how the fine-tuning constructions can be further extended, adapted or exploited in presence of perturbations, both single-particle and many-body. This strategy has lead to the discovery of non-perturbative metal-insulator transitions, fractal phases, nonlinear and quantum caging and many-body nonergodic quantum models. We discuss what implications these results may have for the design of fine-tuned nanophotonic systems including photonic crystals, nanocavities, and metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Rapid non-destructive inspection of sub-surface defects in 3D printed alumina through 30 layers with 7 {\mu}m depth resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of additive manufacturing (AM) processes for industrial fabrication has grown rapidly over the last ten years. The most well-known AM technologies are fused deposition modelling and stereolithography techniques. One particular industry where 3D printing is advantageous over traditional fabrication techniques is within ceramic components due to its flexibility. To establish a new and improved level of print quality and reduce resource consumption in the 3D printing ceramics industry, there is a need for fast integrated, sub-surface and non-destructive inspection (NDI) with high resolution. Several techniques have already been developed for high-resolution NDI, such as X-ray computed tomography (XCT), but none of them are both fast, integrable, and non-destructive while allowing deep penetration with high resolution. \newline In this study, we demonstrate sub-surface monitoring of 3D printed alumina parts to a depth of $\sim$0.7 mm in images of 400$\times$2048 pixels with a lateral resolution of 30~$\mu$m and depth (or axial) resolution of 7$~\mu$m . The results were achieved using mid-infrared optical coherence tomography (MIR OCT) based on a MIR supercontinuum laser with a 4$~\mu$m center wavelength. We find that it is possible to detect individual printed ceramic layers and track predefined defects through all four processing steps: green, preconditioned, debinded, and sintered. Our results also demonstrate how a defect in the green phase could affect the final product. Based on the understanding of how defects develop in maturing printed parts, we pave the way for NDI integration in AM, which can be combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for automatic defect classification in volume production of a new standard of high quality ceramic components.</description>

      <title>3D printing of hierarchical structures made of inorganic silicon-rich glass featuring self-forming nanogratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical structures are abundant in nature, such as in the superhydrophobic surfaces of lotus leaves and the structural coloration of butterfly wings. They consist of ordered features across multiple size scales, and their unique properties have attracted enormous interest in wide-ranging fields, including energy storage, nanofluidics, and nanophotonics. Femtosecond lasers, capable of inducing various material modifications, have shown promise for manufacturing tailored hierarchical structures. However, existing methods such as multiphoton lithography and 3D printing using nanoparticle-filled inks typically involve polymers and suffer from high process complexity. Here, we demonstrate 3D printing of hierarchical structures in inorganic silicon-rich glass featuring self-forming nanogratings. This approach takes advantage of our finding that femtosecond laser pulses can induce simultaneous multiphoton crosslinking and self-formation of nanogratings in hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). The 3D printing process combines the 3D patterning capability of multiphoton lithography and the efficient generation of periodic structures by the self-formation of nanogratings. We 3D-printed micro-supercapacitors with large surface areas and a remarkable areal capacitance of 1 mF/cm^2 at an ultrahigh scan rate of 50 V/s, thereby demonstrating the utility of our 3D printing approach for device applications in emerging fields such as energy storage.</description>

      <title>Rotational Doppler Effect and Spin-Rotation Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rotational Doppler Effect (RDE) involves both the orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic radiation as well as its helicity. The RDE phenomena associated with photon helicity go beyond the standard theory of relativity. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the theoretical basis of the helicity-dependent RDE in terms of the general phenomenon of spin-rotation coupling. The physical implications of this coupling are briefly pointed out and the nonlocal theory of rotating observers is described. For an observer rotating uniformly about the direction of incidence of a plane wave of definite helicity, the nonlocally measured amplitude of the wave is larger (smaller) if the observer rotates in the same (opposite) sense as the electromagnetic field. The implications of the nonlocal helicity dependence of the measured amplitude of the radiation are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of multiphoton quantum coherence by light propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light. Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such, different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here, we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Convert laser light into single photons via interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum electrodynamics and interference.</description>

      <title>Surface figure correction using differential deposition of WSi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface figure of an x-ray mirror was improved by differential deposition of WSi2 layers. DC magnetron sputtering through beam-defining apertures was applied on moving substrates to generate thin films with arbitrary longitudinal thickness variations. The required velocity profiles were calculated using a deconvolution algorithm. Height errors were evaluated after each correction iteration using offline visible light surface metrology. WSi2 was selected as a promising material since it conserves the initial substrate surface roughness and limits the film stress to acceptable levels. On a 300 mm long flat Si mirror the shape error was reduced to less than 0.2 nm RMS.</description>

Abstract: The empirical law of Gladstone-Dale is insufficient for high-precision studies using the refractivity of a gas: this is not exactly proportional to its density, and the gas may not be properly described as perfect. An optical Mariotte temperature allows making a comparative analysis of the results given by various authors. The effect of hygrometry on the refractivity at visible wavelengths is historically traced and its small effect on the astronomical refraction angle numerically shown. Finally at infrared and radio wavelengths, the effects of the humidity in the lower atmosphere can be strong; as for the ionosphere, its curvature plays an essential role for the astronomical refraction angle unlike in the visible.</description>

      <title>Bright traveling breathers in media with long-range, nonconvex dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence and properties of envelope solitary waves on a periodic, traveling wave background, called traveling breathers, are investigated numerically in representative nonlocal dispersive media. Using a fixed point computational scheme, a space-time boundary value problem for bright traveling breather solutions is solved for the weakly nonlinear Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation, a nonlocal, regularized shallow water wave model, and the strongly nonlinear conduit equation, a nonlocal model of viscous core-annular flows. Curves of unit-mean traveling breather solutions within a three-dimensional parameter space are obtained. Resonance due to nonconvex, rational linear dispersion leads to a nonzero oscillatory background upon which traveling breathers propagate. These solutions exhibit a topological phase jump, so act as defects within the periodic background. For small amplitudes, traveling breathers are well-approximated by bright soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a negligibly small periodic background. These solutions are numerically continued into the large amplitude regime as elevation defects on cnoidal or cnoidal-like periodic traveling wave backgrounds. This study of bright traveling breathers provides insight into systems with nonconvex, nonlocal dispersion that occur in a variety of media such as internal oceanic waves subject to rotation and short, intense optical pulses.</description>

      <title>Efficient prediction of attosecond two-colour pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers are sources of coherent, high-intensity X-rays with numerous applications in ultra-fast measurements and dynamic structural imaging. Due to the stochastic nature of the self-amplified spontaneous emission process and the difficulty in controlling injection of electrons, output pulses exhibit significant noise and limited temporal coherence. Standard measurement techniques used for characterizing two-coloured X-ray pulses are challenging, as they are either invasive or diagnostically expensive. In this work, we employ machine learning methods such as neural networks and decision trees to predict the central photon energies of pairs of attosecond fundamental and second harmonic pulses using parameters that are easily recorded at the high-repetition rate of a single shot. Using real experimental data, we apply a detailed feature analysis on the input parameters while optimizing the training time of the machine learning methods. Our predictive models are able to make predictions of central photon energy for one of the pulses without measuring the other pulse, thereby leveraging the use of the spectrometer without having to extend its detection window. We anticipate applications in X-ray spectroscopy using XFELs, such as in time-resolved X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy, where improved measurement of input spectra will lead to better experimental outcomes.</description>
