      <title>The Impact of Natural External Forcing on Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency Since the 1980s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal evolution of ocean heat uptake efficiency (OHUE) using observations and large ensemble model simulations. OHUE, defined as the ratio of the rate in ocean heat uptake to changes in global mean surface temperature anomalies, has exhibited significant variability over recent decades. We found a relatively low OHUE in the late 1980s, a peak around 2000, and a subsequent decline. A key finding is the significant influence of natural external forcing, mainly volcanic eruptions, which causes an abrupt decline in OHUE followed by a gradual recovery. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, a major volcanic event of the 20th century, had a lasting impact on OHUE. This study emphasizes the contribution of mid-latitudes to global OHUE changes. Our findings underscore the importance of considering natural external forcing in understanding climate dynamics and suggest conducting idealized experiments to quantify the potential effects of future volcanic eruptions on OHUE.</description>

      <title>Organization of Historical Oceanic Overturnings on Cross-Sphere Climate Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global ocean meridional overturning circulation (GMOC) is central for ocean transport and climate variations. However, a comprehensive picture of its historical mean state and variability remains vague due to limitations in modelling and observing systems. Incorporating observations into models offers a viable approach to reconstructing climate history, yet achieving coherent estimates of GMOC has proven challenging due to difficulties in harmonizing ocean stratification. Here, we demonstrate that applying multiscale data assimilation scheme that integrates atmospheric and oceanic observations into multiple coupled models in a dynamically consistent way, the global ocean currents and GMOC over the past 80 years are retrieved. While the major historic events are printed in variability of the rebuilt GMOC, the timeseries of multisphere 3-dimensional physical variables representing the realistic historical evolution enable us to advance understanding of mechanisms of climate signal propagation cross spheres and give birth to Artificial Intelligence coupled big models, thus advancing the Earth science.</description>

      <title>Climate impacts of equatorial superrotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is expected that the large-scale tropical circulation should undergo some changes in a warmer climate, it remains an open question whether its characteristic features, such as the Hadley cell, the intertropical convergence zone, or the weak surface easterlies, could take a completely different shape. As an example, it has been hypothesized that the Earth's atmosphere may have experienced equatorial superrotation -- i.e. westerly winds at the equator -- during its history. The possibility of equatorial superrotation has been studied in a range of planetary atmospheres, including Earth-like ones, with the objective of understanding the underlying dynamical processes. However, the broader impact that this dramatic circulation change would have on the climate system is practically unexplored. This is the question we address here. We perform idealized GCM simulations with an imposed equatorial torque to investigate how a forced superrotating atmosphere affects surface temperature and the water cycle. We show that these effects are quite large and directly related to the global circulation changes, which extend beyond the tropical atmosphere. Using tools including a forcing/feedback analysis and a moist energy balance model, we argue that the dominant mechanism is changes in atmospheric energy transport, driven in particular by the collapse of the meridional overturning circulation, and to a smaller extent by the appearance of an equatorial jet, and the concomitant redistribution of moisture in the tropics, leading to a much weaker relative humidity gradient which has strong radiative effects.</description>

      <title>Substantial Diel Changes of Cloud Adjustments to Aerosols in Ship-tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human induced changes in atmospheric aerosols have introduced a climate forcing by modifying cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water, and cloud fraction. This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud adjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also temporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar heating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited. Here, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the cloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted clouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to automatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud adjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended nighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast, liquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally decrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most of these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from differences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud fraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1 to -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal variations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may partially offset it. These findings underscore the importance of diel variations in aerosol cloud interactions. Our approach demonstrates that ship tracks, despite appearing as instantaneous observations, yield valuable insights into the temporal evolution of cloud adjustments.</description>

      <title>Center-fixing of tropical cyclones using uncertainty-aware deep learning applied to high-temporal-resolution geostationary satellite imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the location of a tropical cyclone's (TC) surface circulation center -- "center-fixing" -- is a critical first step in the TC-forecasting process, affecting current and future estimates of track, intensity, and structure. Despite a recent increase in automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are not available at every forecast cycle. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the operational ATCF, it relies only on geostationary IR satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (&lt; 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 9 channels at lag times up to 4 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes &gt; 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for tropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors with microwave or scatterometer data, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification, producing a well calibrated ensemble of 150 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10 min.</description>

      <title>A thermal Green-Naghdi model with time dependent bathymetry and complete Coriolis force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the theoretical Euler-Poincar\'e framework for modelling ocean mixed layer dynamics. Through a symmetry-broken Lie group invariant variational principle, we derive a generalised Green-Naghdi equation with time dependent bathymetry, a complete Coriolis force, and inhomogeneity of the thermal buoyancy. The nature of the model derived here lends it a potential future application to wave dynamics generated by changes to the bathymetry.</description>
