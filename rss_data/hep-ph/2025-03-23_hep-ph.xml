      <title>Efficient use of quantum computers for collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most observables at particle colliders involve physics at a wide variety of distance scales. Due to asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction, the physics at short distances can be calculated reliably using perturbative techniques, while long distance physics is non-perturbative in nature. Factorization theorems separate the contributions from different scales scales, allowing to identify the pieces that can be determined perturbatively from those that require non-perturbative information, and if the non-perturbative pieces can be reliably determined, one can use experimental measurements to extract the short distance effects, sensitive to possible new physics. Without the ability to compute the non-perturbative ingredients from first principles one typically identifies observables for which the non-perturbative information is universal in the sense that it can be extracted from some experimental observables and then used to predict other observables. In this paper we argue that the future ability to use quantum computers to calculate non-perturbative matrix elements from first principles will allow to make predictions for observables with non-universal non-perturbative long-distance physics.</description>

      <title>Two-loop light-quark Electroweak corrections to Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute two-loop electroweak corrections to double Higgs boson production in gluon fusion mediated by light quarks in a fully analytical way. We determine a basis of master integrals satisfying canonical differential equations in $\mathrm{d}\log$ form, enhanced by subsequent rotations to remove unnecessary functions that do not appear in the analytic expressions of the amplitudes. We determine the integration constants by matching our expressions to the large mass expansion limit of the canonical integrals. We express the solution of differential equations in terms of Chen iterated integrals up to transcendental weight six over logarithmic kernels with algebraic arguments, and further decompose them by employing a basis of uniform weight functions. By deriving differential equations for such basis, we provide numerical results as well as routines for optimised numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>High-quality Peccei-Quinn symmetry from the interplay of vertical and horizontal gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a class of axion models where an accidental $\mathrm{U}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry automatically emerges from the interplay of vertical (grand-unified) and horizontal (flavor) gauge symmetries. Focusing on a specific Pati-Salam realization, we analyze the quality of the PQ symmetry and demonstrate that the model non-trivially reproduces the Standard Model flavor structure. In the pre-inflationary PQ-breaking scenario, the axion mass window is predicted to be $m_a \in [2 \times 10^{-8}, 10^{-3}]\,\mathrm{eV}$. A high-quality axion, immune to the PQ quality problem, is obtained instead for $m_a \gtrsim 0.01\,\mathrm{eV}$, corresponding to a post-inflationary PQ-breaking scenario. A distinctive feature of this setup is the presence of parametrically light fermions, known as anomalons, which are introduced to cancel the gauge anomalies of the flavor symmetry. For the most favorable values of the PQ-breaking scale needed to address the PQ quality problem, the anomalons are expected to have masses below the eV scale. We further investigate their cosmological production in the early universe, highlighting how measurements of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ could serve as a low-energy probe of the ultraviolet dynamics addressing the PQ quality problem.</description>

      <title>Virtual Majorana Neutrinos and the Minimum Neutrino Mass Scale in Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Majorana neutrinos are indispensable for neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay. In this study, we demonstrate that the overlap of the virtual Majorana neutrino wavefunction, predominantly composed of a right-handed antineutrino component with a strongly suppressed left-handed component (with amplitude proportional to the effective Majorana neutrino mass, $|m_{\beta\beta}|$, is crucial for triggering this decay process. This effective mass, derived from the minimum neutrino mass, offers valuable insights into the absolute neutrino mass scale. Using best-fit parameters from neutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$ which is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted hierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to be 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing a potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios. From these values, we calculate $|m_{\beta\beta}|$, which plays a central role in $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. By combining $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ with decay phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements, and the absorption probability of the virtual Majorana neutrino, we estimate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life for key isotopes, namely, $^{76}$Ge, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using two independent methods. The results are in good agreement, and we also discuss the uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements that may affect these calculations.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscous coefficients of a hot and chirally imbalanced quark matter using NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shear $\eta$ and bulk $\zeta$ viscous coefficients have been calculated in a hot and chirally asymmetric quark matter quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP) using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model. This is done by employing the one-loop Green-Kubo formalism where the viscous coefficients have been extracted from the long-wavelength limit of the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the energy momentum tensor (EMT) current correlator calculated using the real time formalism of finite temperature field theory. The momentum dependent thermal width of the quark/antiquark that enters into the expression of the viscosities as a dynamical input containing interactions, has been obtained from the $2\to2$ scattering processes mediated via the collective mesonic modes in scalar and pseudoscalar chanels encoded in respective in-medium polarization functions having explicit temperature and CCP dependence. Several thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, energy density, entropy density $(s)$, specific heat and isentropic speed of sound have also been calculated at finite CCP. The temperature and CCP dependence of the viscosity to entropy density ratios $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ have also been studied.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows of identified hadrons in the equal-velocity quark combination model at RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an equal-velocity quark combination model to study anisotropic flows $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies. Under the equal-velocity combination mechanism of constituent quarks at hadronization, we build analytical formulas of anisotropic flows of hadrons in terms of those of quarks just before hadronization. We systematically analyze the contribution of higher order flows of quarks, and show how simple formulas of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons with the desired precision can be obtained by neglecting the small contribution of higher order flows of quarks. We systematically test these simple formulas of hadronic flows by the experimental data of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons $\phi$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\Omega^{-}$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 54.4 and 200 GeV, and we find that the equal-velocity quark combination model can well describe the measured $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons in Au+Au collisions at those collision energies. We further study the obtained anisotropic flows of quarks and find two scaling properties\textcolor{red}{{} }which can be qualitatively understood by the hydrodynamic evolution of thermal quark medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Glueballonia as Hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work out the Hopfion description of glueballs by inclusively comparing the energy spectra obtained by quantizing Hopfions with experimental data and lattice QCD. Identifying a Hopfion carrying a unit topological charge as $f_0(1500)$, the Hopfions with the topological charge two are classified as glueballonia, i.e., two glueballs are bound together. We find a tightly and a loosely bound glueballonia complying with $f_0 (2470)$ and a novel scalar particle carrying the mass around 2814 MeV, respectively, and calculate their binding energies. By the rigid body quantization of Hopfions, we predict a characteristic multiplet structure of tensor glueball states. Some of them are missing in the current experimental data and can be verified in future measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\Delta(1232)$ resonance substructure in $p\gamma^*\to \Delta(1232)$ process through helicity amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the substructure of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance in the $p\gamma^*\to \Delta(1232)$ process through helicity transition amplitudes within the quark model framework. We consider the involved baryons composed of three quarks, and both the quark core and meson cloud contribute to the transition amplitudes. The comparison of theoretical results with experimental data reveals that, rather than the $L=0$ component of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance, it is the $L=2$ component that significantly affects its $S_{1/2}$ amplitude. These findings indicate that the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance likely contains a substantial $L=2$ component, challenging the conventional view of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance as an $L=0$ baryon.</description>

      <title>A three-body form factor at sub-leading power in the high-energy limit: planar contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-loop planar contributions to a three-body form factor at the next-to-leading power in the high-energy limit, where the masses of external particles are much smaller than their energies. The calculation is performed by exploiting the differential equations of the expansion coefficients, both for facilitating the linear relations among them, and for deriving their analytic expressions. The result is written in terms of generalized polylogarithms involving a few simple symbol letters. Our method can be readily applied to the calculation of non-planar contributions as well. The result provides crucial information for establishing sub-leading factorization theorems for massive scattering amplitudes in the high-energy limit.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram for Large $N_f$ : Analysis from Contact Interaction Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the impact of a higher number of light quark flavors, $N_f$, on the QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions. Our formalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, employing a specific symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dressed contact interaction model of quarks in Landau gauge, utilizing the rainbow-Ladder truncation. We derive expressions for the dressed quark mass $M_f$ and effective potential $\Omega^{f}$ at zero, at finite temperature $T$ and the quark chemical potential $\mu$. The transition between chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is triggered by the effective potential of the contact interaction, whereas the confinement and deconfinement transition is approximated from the confinement length scale $\tilde{\tau}_{ir}$. Our analysis reveals that at $(T = \mu = 0)$, increasing $N_f$ leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement of quarks when $N_f$ reaches its critical value, $N^{c}_{f} \approx 8$. At this critical value, In the chiral limit ($m_f = 0$), the global minimum of the effective potential occurs at the point where the dressed quark mass approaches zero ($M_f \rightarrow 0$). However, when a bare quark mass of $m_f = 7$ MeV is introduced, the global minimum shifts slightly to a nonzero value, approaching $M_f \rightarrow m_f$. At finite $T$ and $\mu$, we illustrate the QCD phase diagram in the $(T^{\chi,C}_{c} -\mu)$ plane, for various numbers of light quark flavors, noting that both the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical chemical potential $\mu_c $ for chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement decrease as $ N_f $ increases. Moreover, the critical endpoint $(T_{EP}, \mu_{EP})$ also shifts to lower values with increasing $N_f $. Our findings are consistent with other low-energy QCD approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chiral Quark--Soliton Model applied to baryons with one heavy quark predicts new exotic states belonging to three $\overline{\boldsymbol{15}}$ SU(3) multiplets. Here, we extend previous analysis of charm exotica to the case of beauty. All model parameters are fixed from the charm sector and from the nonexotic $b$--baryons. We present predictions for masses of beautiful exotica and discuss the decay widths, which are either very small or relatively large.</description>

      <title>Flavored Circular Collider: cornering New Physics at FCC-ee via flavor-changing processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the potential of a future high-intensity $e^+ e^-$ collider running at the $Z$ pole in probing extensions of the Standard Model via precise measurements of flavor-changing processes. We illustrate this potential both within effective field theories and simplified models inspired by current $B$-physics data, focusing on selected flavor-physics measurement projections at FCC-ee, and by the theoretically well-motivated scenario of TeV-scale new physics predominantly coupled to third-generation fields. In particular, we demonstrate the key role played by the interplay among different flavor-physics measurements, and between flavor and electroweak measurements, in cornering the New Physics parameter space. Updated constraints on new physics, in the limit that no deviations from the Standard Model are observed, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Ultraheavy diquark decaying into vectorlike quarks at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the discovery potential of ultraheavy $(7-8.5$ TeV) diquark scalars $(S_{uu})$ produced in the collision of two up quarks at the LHC. Assuming that the diquark scalar decays in two vectorlike quarks of mass around 2 TeV, each of them decaying into a $W^{+}$ boson and a $b$ quark, we focus on the fully hadronic final state. We present a signal-from-background separation study based on a discriminator built with Machine Learning techniques. For this six-jet final state and a luminosity of $3000 \ \text{fb}^{-1}$, we estimate that a diquark scalar of mass near 8 TeV may be discovered or ruled out even when its coupling to up quarks is as low as 0.2.</description>

      <title>Quark Anomalous Magnetic Moments and Neutral Pseudoscalar Meson Dynamics in Magnetized QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quark anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) on the mass spectra of neutral pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$, $K$, $\eta$, $\eta^{'}$) under external magnetic fields, finite temperatures, and quark chemical potentials using the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. By incorporating AMM at the quark level, we reveal that AMM significantly alters the magnetic field dependence of constituent quark masses, inducing first-order phase transitions for light quarks at critical fields, while strange quarks exhibit non-monotonic mass behavior. The inclusion of AMM reshapes the QCD phase diagram, suppressing chiral transition temperatures and shifting critical endpoints (CEP) toward lower $\mu$ and $T$. Notably, crossover transitions observed without AMM are replaced by first-order transitions under strong fields, aligning with lattice QCD predictions for IMC. For mesons, AMM triggers abrupt mass collapses and enhances flavor mixing, accelerating chiral restoration for $K$ and $\eta$ mesons via thresholds tied to strange quark masses. The $\eta'$ meson, as a resonance state, shows suppressed mass growth and instability at strong fields, highlighting limitations in handling non-perturbative decay widths within the NJL framework. These findings underscore AMM critical role in reconciling effective model predictions with LQCD results, particularly in explaining IMC and phase transition dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark sector offers a compelling theoretical framework for addressing the nature of dark matter while potentially solving other fundamental problems in physics. This review focuses on light dark flavored sector models, which are those where the flavor structure of the interactions with the standard model is non-trivial and distinguish among different fermion families. Such scenarios feature flavor violation leading to unique experimental signatures, such as flavor-changing neutral current decays of heavy hadrons (kaons, $D$ and $B$ mesons, baryons) and leptons (muons and taus) with missing energy carried away by light dark-sector particles. In this article, we review their motivation, summarize current constraints, highlight discovery opportunities in ongoing and future flavor experiments, and discuss implications for astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dynamically induced spin-2 mass in a Weyl-invariant framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the ghost-free bimetric theory of gravity with the concept of local Weyl invariance, realized in the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. The gravitational sector, characterized by two independent metrics and two independent connections, is coupled to a scalar field that can in principle develop a non-vanishing expectation value through radiative corrections. The spectrum of the model, apart from the massless standard graviton and a pair of axion-like pseudoscalars, associated with the presence of the Holst invariants in the action, includes an additional spin-$2$ state of a non-vanishing Fierz-Pauli mass proportional to the scalar field vacuum expectation value. We analyze the phenomenology of the model and specify the conditions under which the massive spin-$2$ state could be a primary dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Looking for the {\gamma}-Ray Cascades of the KM3-230213A Neutrino Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme energy of the KM3-230213A event could transform our understanding of the most energetic sources in the Universe. However, it also reveals an inconsistency between the KM3NeT detection and strong IceCube constraints on the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. The most congruous explanation for the KM3NeT and IceCube data requires KM3-230213A to be produced by a (potentially transient) source fortuitously located in a region where the KM3NeT acceptance is maximized. In hadronic models of ultra-high-energy neutrino production, such a source would also produce a bright {\gamma}-ray signal, which would cascade to GeV--TeV energies due to interactions with extragalactic background light. We utilize the {\gamma}-Cascade package to model the spectrum, spatial extension, and time-delay of such a source, and scan a region surrounding the KM3NeT event to search for a consistent {\gamma}-ray signal. We find no convincing evidence for a comparable \textit{Fermi}-LAT source and place constraints on a combination of the source redshift and the intergalactic magnetic field strength between the source and Earth.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Preheating in Higgs--$R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the preheating dynamics and associated gravitational wave signatures in the Higgs--$R^2$ inflationary model. Using lattice simulations, we investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the system across the parameter space, covering both the Higgs-like and $R^2$-like scenarios. We demonstrate that the efficiency of preheating is significantly dependent on the nonminimal coupling parameter $\xi$. As the $\xi$ parameter increases, moving from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime, we observe more efficient preheating. Through detailed numerical computations, efficient preheating is shown to lead to stronger gravitational wave production. The amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum varies by several orders of magnitude as we move from the $R^2$-like regime to the Higgs-like regime. The resultant gravitational wave signatures can serve as a potential observational probe to distinguish between different parameter regimes of the Higgs--$R^2$ model.</description>

      <title>Status and prospects of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ serves as a pivotal role for understanding hadronic structures, remaining one of the most extensively studied exotic particles despite the experimental discovery of numerous unconventional hadronic states. Sustained experimental and theoretical investigations into the particle over the past two decades have propelled its study into a high-precision regime, marked by refined measurements of its decay dynamics and line shape, thereby offering critical insights to resolve longstanding debates between molecular, tetraquark, hybrid, and charmonium interpretations of this particle. The BESIII experiment has made seminal contributions to the study of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, leveraging its unique capabilities in high-statistics data acquisition and low-background condition. This article gives a concise review and prospects of the study of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ from the BESIII experiment.</description>

      <title>Bayesian reconstruction of anisotropic flow fluctuations at fixed impact parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cumulants of the distribution of anisotropic flow are measured accurately in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC as a function of centrality classifiers (charged multiplicity and/or transverse energy). Using Bayesian inference, we reconstruct from these measurements the probability distribution of anisotropic flow in the ``theorists' frame'' where the impact parameter has a fixed magnitude and orientation, up to $\sim 70\%$ centrality. The variation of flow fluctuations with impact parameter displays direct evidence of viscous damping, which is larger for higher Fourier harmonics, in line with expectations from hydrodynamics. We use intensive measures of non-Gaussian flow fluctuations, which have reduced dependence on centrality. We infer from ATLAS data the magnitude of these intensive non-Gaussianities in each Fourier harmonic. They provide data-driven estimates of response coefficients to initial anisotropies, without resorting to any specific microscopic model of initial conditions. These estimates agree with viscous hydrodynamic calculations.</description>

      <title>A Possible Future Use of the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FCC program at CERN provides an attractive all-in-one solution to address many of the key questions in particle physics. While we fully support the efforts towards this ambitious path, we believe that it is important to prepare a mitigation strategy in case the program faces unexpected obstacles for geopolitical or other reasons. This approach could be based on two components: I) a circular electron-positron collider in the LHC tunnel that operates at the Z-pole energy of 45.6 GeV and II) a high-energy electron-positron linear collider which acts as a Higgs, top quark and W-boson factory, and that can further be extended to TeV energies. The former could reach a high luminosity that is not accessible at a linear collider, the latter could probe the high energy regime with higher sensitivity and discovery potential than LEP3. The program should be flanked by dedicated intensity frontier searches at lower energies. These accelerators can be used in a feasible, timely and cost-efficient way to search for new physics and make precise determination of the parameters of the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>

      <title>Linear sigma model with quarks and Polyakov loop in rotation: phase diagrams, Tolman-Ehrenfest law and mechanical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the Polyakov-enhanced linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Working in the homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density and angular frequency, taking into account the causality constraint enforced by the spectral boundary conditions at a cylindrical surface. We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size, angular frequency and chemical potential. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. In the limit of large volume, the thermodynamics of the model is consistent with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma such as the moment of inertia and the $K_4$ shape coefficient.</description>

      <title>Practical Criteria for Entanglement and Nonlocality in Systems with Additive Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general bipartite mixed states, a sufficient and necessary mathematical condition for certifying entanglement and/or (Bell) non-locality remains unknown. In this paper, we examine this question for a broad and physically relevant class of bipartite systems, specifically those possessing an additive observable with a definite value. Such systems include, for example, final states of particle decays or bipartitions of spin chains with well-defined magnetization. We derive very simple, handy criteria for detecting entanglement or non-locality in many cases. For instance, if $\rho_{\left( m p\right)\left( nq\right)} \neq 0$, where the eigenstates $|np\rangle$ or $|mq\rangle$ do not correspond to the given definite value of the additive observable, then the state is necessarily entangled-this condition is very easy to check in practice. If, in addition, the partitioned Hilbert space has dimension 2xd, the condition becomes necessary. Furthermore, if the sectors associated with the eigenstates $|mp\rangle$ or $|nq\rangle$ are non-degenerate, there exists a CHSH inequality that is violated. We illustrate these results by analyzing the potential detection of entanglement and nonlocality in Higgs to ZZ decays at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spectral features of bottomonium at high temperature, in particular the thermal mass shift and width of ground state S-wave and P-wave state. We employ and compare a range of methods for determining these features from lattice NRQCD correlators, including direct correlator analyses (multi-exponential fits and moments of spectral functions), linear methods (Backus-Gilbert, Tikhonov and HLT methods), and Bayesian methods for spectral function reconstruction (MEM and BR). We comment on the reliability and limitations of the various methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly supercooled first order phase transitions (FOPTs) can produce primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM) along with observable gravitational waves (GWs) from bubble collisions. Such FOPTs may also produce coherent magnetic fields generated by bubble collisions and by turbulence in the primordial plasma. Here we find that the requirement for PBH DM can produce large primordial magnetic fields which subsequently yield intergalactic magnetic fields in the present universe (with magnitude $\lesssim 20$ pG across coherence length scales of $\simeq 0.001$-$0.01$ Mpc, assuming maximally helical magnetic fields) that easily exceed lower bounds from blazar observations. We follow a largely model independent approach and highlight the possibility of producing DM and observable multi-messenger magnetic fields and GW signals visible in next generation experiments.</description>

      <title>A Stress Test of Global PDF Fits: Closure Testing the MSHT PDFs and a First Direct Comparison to the Neural Net Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first global closure test of the fixed parameterisation (MSHT) approach to PDF fitting. We find that the default MSHT20 parameterisation can reproduce the features of the input set in such a closure test to well within the textbook uncertainties. This provides strong evidence that parameterisation inflexibility in the MSHT20 fit is not a significant issue in the data region. We also present the first completely like--for--like comparison between two global PDF fits, namely MSHT and NNPDF, where the only difference is guaranteed to be due to the fitting methodology. To achieve this, we present a fit to the NNPDF4.0 data and theory inputs, but with the MSHT fixed parameterisation. We find that this gives a moderately, but noticeably, better fit quality than the central NNPDF4.0 fits, both with perturbative and fitted charm, and that this difference persists at the level of the PDFs and benchmark cross sections. The NNPDF4.0 uncertainties are found to be broadly in line with the MSHT results if a textbook $T^2=1$ tolerance is applied, but to be significantly smaller if a tolerance typical of the MSHT20 fit is applied. This points to an inherent inconsistency between these approaches. We discuss the need for an enlarged tolerance criterion in global PDF fits in detail, and demonstrate the impact of data/theory inconsistencies in the closure test setting; namely, these do not lead to any increase in the $T^2=1$ PDF uncertainty. We also investigate the impact of restricting the PDF parameterisation to have fewer free parameters than the default MSHT20 case, and find this can be significant at the level of both closure tests and the full fit.</description>

Abstract: In light of the recent data for $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}P$ and $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}V$ decays, we perform a model-independent phenomenological analysis in the presence of quasi-elastic rescattering. With the Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model, lifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are investigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that parameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed tree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a consequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future LHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and semi-leptonic CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion down to the nonrelativistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of a magnetic field, axions can convert into photons and vice versa. The phenomenology of the conversion is captured by a system of two coupled Klein-Gordon equations, which, assuming that the axion is relativistic, is usually recast into a pair of first-order Schr\"odinger-like equations. In such a limit, focusing on a constant magnetic field and plasma frequency, the equations admit an exact analytic solution. The relativistic limit significantly simplifies the calculations and, therefore, it is widely used in phenomenological applications. In this work, we discuss how to evaluate the axion-photon system evolution without relying on such relativistic approximation. In particular, we give an exact analytical solution, valid for any axion energy, in the case that both the magnetic field and plasma frequency are constant. Moreover, we devise an analytic perturbative expansion that allows for tracking the conversion probability in a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field or plasma frequency, whose characteristic scale of variation is much larger than the typical axion-photon oscillation length. Finally, we discuss a case of resonant axion-photon conversion giving useful simplified formulae that might be directly applied to dark matter axions converting in neutron star magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Remarkable Scale Relation, Approximate SU(5), Fluctuating Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a series of 8 energy scales, some of which just speculated by ourselves, and fit the logarithms of these energies as a straight line versus a quantity related to the dimensionalities of action terms in a way to be defined in the article. These terms in the action are related to the energy scales in question. So e.g. the dimensionality of Einstein Hilbert action coefficient is one related to the Planck scale. In fact we suppose in the cases described with quantum field theory, that there is for each of our energy scales a pair of associated terms in the Lagrangian density, one "kinetic" and one "mass- or current" term. We use for our plotting of the energy scales the ratio of the dimensionality of say the "non-kinetic" to the dimensionality of the "kinetic" one The explanation for our phenomenological finding that the logarithm of the energies depend as a straight line on the dimensionality defined integer $q$, we give as an ontological - i.e. it really exists in nature in our model -"fluctuating lattice" with a very broad distribution of say the link size $a$.We take it Gaussian in the logarithm, $\ln(a)$. A fluctuating lattice is very natural in a theory with general relativity, since it corresponds to fluctuations in the gauge d.o.f. of general relativity. Intriguing are the lowest ones of our energy scales, being by us not described by quantum field theory as the other ones, but by actions for single particle or single string respectivily, because the string scale fits well with hadronic strings, and the particle scale is presumably the mass scale of Standard Model group monopoles, a bound state of a couple of which might be the dimuon resonance (or statistical fluctuation) found in LHC with mass 28 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model is proposed, where the Higgs field is valued in the complex projective plane ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$, rather than ${\mathbb{C}}^2$. Its geometry is consistent with $U(2) \simeq (SU(2) \times U(1))/ \mathbb{Z}_2$ electroweak gauge symmetry. The leading terms in the Lagrangian, beyond those of the Standard Model, are much more tightly constrained than in general SMEFTs, and the custodial $SO(4)$ symmetry of the Higgs sector is mildly broken. The predicted tree-level deviations from Standard Model phenomenology depend on a single large mass parameter $M$. Current experimental data imply that $M$ is a few TeV or larger.</description>

      <title>Two-pion exchange for coupled-channel scattering of two heavy mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve the theoretical understanding of multiquark states like $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, we calculate the heavy-meson heavy-(anti)meson scattering potential up to next-to-leading order, $O(Q^2)$, within chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) employing a power counting scheme that explicitly keeps track with the large momentum scale $Q \sim \sqrt{2\mu \delta}$ (where $\delta = m_V - m_P$ is the vector-pseudoscalar mass difference and $\mu$ their reduced mass) introduced by the coupled channel dynamics. We provide expressions for the two-pion exchange (TPE) terms up to $O(Q^2)$ and their partial-wave decomposition. We show that these potentials are well-approximated by contact terms at $O(Q^2)$, with minor residual non-analytic TPE contributions, supporting $\chi$EFT convergence in the theoretical predictions for $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, as well as their spin partners. These findings are also relevant for $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ scattering, especially for the $T_{cc}$ state, for both physical and lattice QCD data with moderately larger pion masses. We further demonstrate that the differences between isovector and isoscalar potentials for heavy mesons are naturally explained by the TPE contributions.</description>

      <title>Tensor meson transition form factors in holographic QCD and the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the prominence of tensor mesons in photon-photon collisions, until recently their contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLBL) scattering part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been estimated at the level of only a few $10^{-12}$, with an almost negligible contribution to the error budget of the Standard Model prediction. A recent reanalysis within the dispersive approach has found that after resolving the issue of kinematic singularities in previous approaches, a larger result is obtained, a few $10^{-11}$, and with opposite sign as in previous results, when a simple quark model for the transition form factors is employed. In this paper, we present the first complete evaluation of tensor meson contributions within a hard-wall model in holographic QCD, which reproduces surprisingly well mass, two-photon width, and the observed singly virtual transition form factors of the dominant $f_2(1270)$, requiring only that the energy-momentum tensor correlator is matched to the leading OPE result of QCD. Due to a second structure function that is absent in the quark model, the result for $a_\mu$ turns out to be positive instead of negative, and also with a magnitude of a few $10^{-11}$. We discuss both pole and non-pole contributions arising from tensor meson exchanges in the holographic HLBL amplitude, finding that keeping all contributions improves dramatically the convergence of a sum over excited tensor mesons and avoids unnaturally large contributions from the first few excited modes at low energies. Moreover, we find that the infinite tower of tensor mesons permits to fill the gap in the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint on the HLBL amplitude left by the contribution of axial vector mesons. Total $a_\mu^\mathrm{Tensor}$ contribution: $+12.4\times 10^{-11}$; with an $F_\rho$ fit this is reduced slightly to $+11.1\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Flavor Constraints in a Generational Three Higgs Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Three Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) that goes beyond natural flavor conservation and in which each of the three Higgs doublets couples mainly to a single generation of fermions via non-standard Yukawa structures. A hierarchy in the vacuum expectation values of the three Higgs doublets can partially address the SM flavor puzzle. In light of the experimentally observed $125$ GeV Higgs boson, we primarily work within a 3HDM alignment limit such that a Standard Model-like Higgs is recovered. In order to reproduce the observed CKM mixing among quarks, the neutral Higgs bosons of the theory necessarily mediate flavor changing neutral currents at the tree level. We consider constraints from neutral kaon, $B$ meson, and $D$ meson mixing as well as from the rare leptonic decays $B_s/B^0/K_L\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-/e^+e^-$. We identify regions of parameter space in which the new physics Higgs bosons can be as light as a TeV or even lighter.</description>

      <title>Chiral Representation of the Nucleon Mass at Leading Two-loop Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we present a number of developments within the scheme of Local Analytic Sector Subtraction for infrared divergences in QCD. First, we extend the scheme to deal with next-to-leading-order (NLO) singularities related to massive QCD particles in the final state. Then, we document a new implementation of the NLO subtraction scheme in the MADNKLO automated numerical framework, which is constructed to host higher-order subtraction algorithms. In particular, we discuss improvements in its performances with respect to the original implementation. Finally we describe the MADNKLO implementation of the first elements relevant to Local Analytic Sector Subtraction at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), in the case of massless QCD partons in the final state.</description>

Abstract: We present the first direct ab-initio computation of unequal-time correlation functions in non-Abelian lattice gauge theory. We demonstrate non-trivial consistency relations among correlators, time-translation invariance, and agreement with Monte-Carlo results for thermal equilibrium in 3+1 dimensions by employing our stabilized complex Langevin method. Our work sets the stage to extract real-time observables, relevant to quark-gluon plasma physics within a first-principles real-time framework.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 16$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex Langevin (CL) is a computational method to circumvent the numerical sign problem with applications in finite-density quantum chromodynamics and the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories. It has long been known that, depending on the simulated system, CL does not always converge correctly. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that the success or failure of the complex Langevin method is deeply tied to the Lefschetz thimble structure of the simulated system. This is demonstrated by constructing weight function regularizations that deform the thimbles of systems with compact domains. Our results indicate that CL converges correctly when the regularized system exhibits a single relevant compact thimble. We introduce a bias correction to retrieve the values of the original theory for parameter sets where a direct complex Langevin approach fails. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated using several toy models, including the cosine model and the SU(2) and SU(3) Polyakov chains. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and limitations of this regularization approach for lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis Conditions in Outflows of White Dwarfs Collapsing to Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (&gt;5s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, yet they provide valuable reference cases for comparison with future long-term magneto-hydrodynamic and three-dimensional AIC studies.</description>

      <title>Prediction of an $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $\bar{b}\bar{b}ud$ Tetraquark Resonance Close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ Threshold Using Lattice QCD Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use antistatic-antistatic potentials computed with lattice QCD and a coupled-channel Born-Oppenheimer approach to explore the existence of a $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$. A pole in the $\mbox{T}$ matrix signals a resonance with mass $m = 2 m_B + 94.0^{+1.3}_{-5.4} \, \text{MeV}$ and decay width $\Gamma = 140^{+86}_{-66} \, \text{MeV}$, i.e. very close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ threshold. We also compute branching ratios, which clearly indicate that this resonance is mainly composed of a $B^\ast B^\ast$ meson pair with a significantly smaller $B B$ contribution. By varying the potential matrix responsible for the coupling of the $B B$ and the $B^\ast B^\ast$ channel as well as the $b$ quark mass, we provide additional insights and understanding concerning the formation and existence of the resonance. We also comment on the importance of our findings and the main takeaways for a possible future full lattice QCD investigation of this $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$ $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance.</description>

Abstract: We study the collinear factorization of off-shell scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (sYM) theory. These are constructed starting from six-dimensional N = (1,1) sYM, taking advantage of an available unconstrained spinor-helicity formalism combined with a unitarity-cut sewing procedure. After generalized dimensional reduction, their collinear behavior is dissected with assistance from the Method of Regions. We then construct off-shell splitting amplitudes directly using the same techniques, establishing equivalence to the amplitude analysis. The calculations are performed at one-loop order.</description>
