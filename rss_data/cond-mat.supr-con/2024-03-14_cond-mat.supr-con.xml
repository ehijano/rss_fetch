      <title>Weyl superconductivity and quasiperiodic Majorana arcs in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl superconductivity is a topological phase in three-dimensional crystals in which the Weyl equation describes quasiparticle excitation near band-touching points in momentum space called Weyl nodes. For quasicrystals which lack translational symmetry, a theory of Weyl superconductivity has not been established, in spite of recent extensive studies on quasicrystalline topological phases. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of quasicrystalline Weyl superconductivity by extending the definition of Weyl superconductivity to periodically stacked, two-dimensional superconducting quasicrystals. We identify quasicrystalline Weyl nodes -- topologically protected point nodes in one-dimensional momentum space corresponding to the stacking direction -- in terms of a topological invariant given by a change in the Bott index in quasicrystalline layers. We find that these Weyl nodes exist in pairs and that Majorana zero-energy modes protected by the nonzero Bott index between a pair of quasicrystalline Weyl nodes appear on surfaces. These Majorana zero modes form an infinite number of arcs in momentum space, densely and quasiperiodically distributed as a function of momentum in the direction of surfaces within each quasicrystalline layer. In Ammann-Beenker (Penrose) quasicrystals, the quasiperiodicity of Majorana arcs is governed by the silver (golden) ratio associated with the quasicrystalline structure.</description>

      <title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in 3He superfluids in zero temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rotating 3He superfluids the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of the AB interface has been found to follow the theoretical model above 0.4 Tc. A deviation from this dependence has been assumed possible at the lowest temperatures. Our NMR and thermal bolometer measurements down to 0.2 Tc show that the critical KH rotation velocity follows the extrapolation from higher temperatures. We interpret this to mean that the KH instability is a bulk phenomenon and is not compromised by interactions with the wall of the rotating container, although weak pinning of the interface to the wall is observed during slow sweeping of the magnetic field. The KH measurement provides the only so far existing determination of the interfacial AB surface tension as a function of pressure and temperature down to 0.2 Tc.</description>

      <title>Electronic diffusion in a normal state of high-Tc cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bad metallic phase with resistivity above the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, which appears also in cuprate superconductors, was recently understood by cold atom and computer simulations of the Hubbard model via charge susceptibility and charge diffusion constant. However, since reliable simulations can be typically done only at temperatures above the experimental temperatures, the question for cuprate superconductors is still open. This paper addresses this question by resorting to heat transport, which allows for the estimate of electronic diffusion and it further combines it with the resistivity to estimate the charge susceptibility. The doping and temperature dependencies of diffusion constant and charge susceptibilities are shown and discussed for two samples of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Results indicate strongly incoherent transport, mean free path corresponding to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for the underdoped sample at temperatures above ~200 K and significant effect of the charge susceptibility on the resistivity.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a distinct collective mode in kagome superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective modes of the superconducting (SC) order parameter fluctuation can provide key insights into the nature of the superconductor, such as the pairing symmetry and orbital nature of the cooper pairs. Their detection has been challenging. Recently, a family of charge density wave (CDW) superconductors has emerged in non-magnetic kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs), exhibiting evidence for unprecedented time-reversal symmetry breaking CDW, roton-pair density wave (PDW), and higher-charge flux quantization. However, the collective behaviors of the cooper pairs have not been studied. Here, we report a distinct collective mode in the kagome superconductors CsV3-xTaxSb5. Using scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy (STM/S), we observe a "peak-dip-hump" feature in the tunneling conductance-a defining signature of collective excitations. The spectral lineshape is well-described by two SC gap functions, one isotropic and one anisotropic, and a bosonic mode due to electron-mode coupling. With increasing x, the two SC gaps, with different pair-breaking strengths and thus different orbital/band characters, move closer in energy, merge into two isotropic gaps of equal amplitude, and then increase synchronously. The collective mode energy, on the other hand, decreases monotonically to well below the quasi-particle excitation gap 2{\Delta} and survives even after the CDW order is suppressed at large x. We identify the collective mode as the Leggett mode of the relative phases between different SC components in the multi-band superconductor or the exotic Bardasis-Schrieffer mode due to a subleading SC component. Our findings provide valuable insights on the nature of the SC ground state and collective excitations, their evolution with Ta-substitutions, and offer a new pathway to study the origin of superconductivity and its interplay with CDW order in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Persistent Current Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: ($i$) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; ($ii$) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring about a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. In addition, we propose a physical model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin fluctuations and long-range interactions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has been extensively explored both theoretically and experimentally as a suitable platform for a rich and tunable phase diagram that includes ferromagnetism, charge order, broken symmetries, and unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the intricate interplay between long-range electron-electron interactions, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity in MATBG. By employing a low-energy model for MATBG that captures the correct shape of the flat bands, we explore the effects of short- and long-range interactions on spin fluctuations and their impact on the superconducting (SC) pairing vertex in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We find that the SC state is notably influenced by the strength of long-range Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, our RPA calculations indicate that there is a regime where the system can traverse from a magnetic phase to the SC phase by \emph{increasing} the relative strength of long-range interactions compared to the on-site ones. These findings underscore the relevance of electron-electron interactions in shaping the intriguing properties of MATBG and offer a pathway for designing and controlling its SC phase.</description>
