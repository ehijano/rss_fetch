      <title>On partial representations of pointed Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial representations of Hopf algebras were motivated by the theory of partial representations of groups. Alves, Batista e Vercruysse introduced partial representations of a Hopf algebra and showed that, as in the case of partial groups actions, a partial $H$-action on an algebra $A$ leads to a partial representation on the algebra of linear endomorphisms of $A$, and a left module $M$ over the partial smash product of $A$ by $H$ carries also a partial representation of $H$ on its algebra of linear endomorphisms. Moreover, partial representations of $H$ correspond to left modules over a Hopf algebroid $H_{par}$. It is known from a result by Dokuchaev, Exel and Piccione that when $H$ is the algebra of a finite group $G$, then $H_{par}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of a finite groupoid determined by $G$. In this work we show that if $H$ is a pointed Hopf algebra with finite group $G$ of grouplikes then $H_{par}$ can be written as a direct sum of unital ideals indexed by the components of the same groupoid associated to the group $G$.</description>

      <title>Naimark's Problem for graph C*-algebras and Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how boundary paths in a graph can be used to construct irreducible representations of the associated graph C*-algebra and the associated Leavitt path algebra. We use this construction to establish two sets of results: First, we prove that Naimark's Problem has an affirmative answer for graph C*-algebras, we prove that the algebraic analogue of Naimark's Problem has an affirmative answer for Leavitt path algebras, and we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the graphs for the hypotheses of Naimark's Problem to be satisfied. Second, we characterize when a graph C*-algebra has a countable (i.e., finite or countably infinite) spectrum, and prove that in this case the unitary equivalence classes of irreducible representations are in one-to-one correspondence with the shift-tail equivalence classes of the boundary paths of the graph.</description>

      <title>Embedding tensors on 3-Leibniz algebras and their derived algebraic structures and deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first we introduce the notions of 3-tri-Leibniz algebras and embedding tensors on 3-Leibniz algebras. We show that an embedding tensor gives rise to a 3-tri-Leibniz algebra. Conversely, a 3-tri-Leibniz algebra gives rise to a 3-Leibniz algebra and a representation such that the quotient map is an embedding tensor. Furthermore, any 3-tri-Leibniz algebra can be embedded into an averaging 3-Leibniz algebra. Next, we introduce the notion of 3-tri-Leibniz dialgebras and demonstrate that homomorphic embedding tensors inherently induce 3-tri-Leibniz dialgebras. Finally, we study the linear deformations of embedding tensors by defining first cohomology.</description>

      <title>The higher-order hom-associative Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the higher-order Weyl algebras over a field of characteristic zero, which are formally rigid as associative algebras, can be formally deformed in a nontrivial way as hom-associative algebras. We also show that these hom-associative Weyl algebras arise naturally as hom-associative iterated differential polynomial rings, that they contain no nonzero zero divisors, are power associative only when associative, and that they are simple. We then determine their commuters, nuclei, centers, and derivations. Last, we classify all hom-associative Weyl algebras up to isomorphism and conjecture that all nonzero homomorphisms between any two isomorphic hom-associative Weyl algebras are isomorphisms. The latter conjecture turns out to be stably equivalent to the Generalized Dixmier Conjecture, and hence also to the Jacobian Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Partitions of primitive Boolean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Boolean ring and its Stone space (Boolean space) are primitive if the ring is disjointly generated by its pseudo-indecomposable (PI) elements. Hanf showed that a primitive PI Boolean algebra can be uniquely defined by a structure diagram. In a previous paper we defined trim $P$-partitions of a Stone space, where $P$ is a PO system (poset with a distinguished subset), and showed how they provide a physical representation within the Stone space of these structure diagrams.
  In this paper we study the class of trim partitions of a fixed primitive Boolean space, which may not be compact, and show how they can be structured as a quasi-ordered set via an appropriate refinement relation. This refinement relation corresponds to a surjective morphism of the associated PO systems, and we establish a quasi-order isomorphism between the class of well-behaved partitions of a primitive space and a class of extended PO systems.
  We also define rank partitions, which generalise the rank diagrams introduced by Myers, and the ideal completion of a trim $P$-partition, whose underlying PO system is the ideal completion of $P$, and show that rank partitions are just the ideal completions of trim partitions. In the process, we extend a number of existing results regarding primitive Boolean algebras or compact primitive Boolean spaces to locally compact Boolean spaces.</description>

      <title>Weak representability of actions of non-associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the categorical-algebraic condition that internal actions are weakly representable (WRA) in the context of varieties of (non-associative) algebras over a field.
  Our first aim is to give a complete characterization of action accessible, operadic quadratic varieties of non-associative algebras which satisfy an identity of degree two and to study the representability of actions for them. Here we prove that the varieties of two-step nilpotent (anti-)commutative algebras and that of commutative associative algebras are weakly action representable, and we explain that the condition (WRA) is closely connected to the existence of a so-called amalgam.
  Our second aim is to work towards the construction, still within the context of algebras over a field, of a weakly representing object $E(X)$ for the actions on (or split extensions of) an object $X$. We actually obtain a partial algebra $E(X)$, which we call external weak actor of $X$, together with a monomorphism of functors ${\operatorname{SplExt}(-,X) \rightarrowtail \operatorname{Hom}(U(-),E(X))}$, which we study in detail in the case of quadratic varieties. Furthermore, the relations between the construction of the universal strict general actor $\operatorname{USGA}(X)$ and that of $E(X)$ are described in detail. We end with some open questions.</description>

      <title>The Bloch--Kato conjecture, decomposing fields, and generating cohomology in degree one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Bloch--Kato conjecture implies that for a field $F$ containing a primitive $p$ th root of unity, the cohomology ring of the absolute Galois group $G_F$ of $F$ with $\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients is generated by degree one elements. We investigate other groups with this property and characterize all such groups that are finite. As a further step in this program, we study implications of the Bloch--Kato conjecture to cohomological invariants of finite field extensions. Conversely, these cohomological invariants have implications for refining the Bloch--Kato conjecture. In service of such a refinement, we define the notion of a decomposing field for a cohomology class of a finite field extension and study minimal decomposing fields of degree two cohomology classes arising from degree $p$ extensions. We illustrate this refinement by explicitly computing the cohomology rings of superpythagorean fields and $p$-rigid fields. Finally, we construct nontrivial examples of cohomology classes and their decomposing fields, which rely on computations by David Benson in the appendix.</description>
