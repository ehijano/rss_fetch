      <title>2025 update on $\varepsilon_K$ in the Standard Model with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $|\varepsilon_K|$ calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $F_K$, and $m_c$ (charm quark mass). We find a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $\approx 5\sigma$ ($5.2\sigma \sim 4.6\sigma$) level between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs. The standard model with lattice QCD inputs describes only 65\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$, and does not explain its remaining 35\%. We also find that this tension disappears when we use inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ which comes from the heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules. This tension is highly correlated with the discrepancy between exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, and inclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We also present results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension at the $5.5\sigma \sim 4.9\sigma$ level with lattice QCD inputs.</description>

      <title>Perturbative determination of $\mathcal{O}(a\,m)$ improvement on the QCD running coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the perturbative results of the discretization errors proportional to the quark mass ($\mathcal{O}(a m)$) on the QCD running coupling within lattice perturbation theory. Our analysis involves calculating the 2-loop renormalization factor $Z_g$ using improved lattice actions for the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group and $N_f$ multiplets of fermions with a finite quark mass. We employ the background field method to compute $Z_g$, by calculating quantum corrections on both the background and quantum gluon propagator, respecting the $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement. This allows us to evaluate the perturbative $\mathcal{O}(a m)$ lattice errors which affect the determination of the running coupling. Eliminating these $\mathcal{O}(a m)$ effects is crucial for the nonperturbative studies of precision determinations of the strong coupling constant using lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay in triamond lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from a false vacuum to the true vacuum is a real-time phenomenon of interest in many contexts. It represents a special challenge for strongly interacting non-Abelian gauge theories because standard spacetime lattices incorporate imaginary time from the outset. To attain real-time phenomena, Hamiltonian lattice methods are being developed for quantum computers. The present work considers SU(2) gauge theory on a minimal lattice in three spatial dimensions, where round-the-world strings called torelons can travel and interact. This minimal 3D lattice has a triamond structure whose properties are elucidated by calculating the spectrum of torelon states. Then, by introducing a twisted boundary condition, real-time evolution is used to demonstrate the decay of a false vacuum. Calculations in the present work are done on classical computers except for one benchmark study of imaginary time evolution that ran on the ibm_brisbane quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Form factors in semileptonic decay of D mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vector, scalar and tensor form factors for the semileptonic process $D\rightarrow K$ by using lattice Quantum Chromodynamcs (QCD). Chiral lattice fermions are used in our study: overlap fermion for the valence quark and domain-wall fermion for the sea. The 2+1-flavor configurations are from the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations with an inverse lattice spacing $1/a=2.383(9)$ GeV. A modified $z$-expansion taking into account valence quark mass dependence is used to fit our numerical results of the form factors at a fixed pion mass $\sim360$ MeV in the sea. At the physical valence quark mass point we give the preliminary results $f_+(0)=f_0(0)=0.760(39)$ and $f_T(0)=0.733(50)$ with only statistical uncertainties. For $f_T$ the number is given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of 2 GeV.</description>

      <title>Thermal Field Theory in the Presence of a Background Magnetic Field and its Application to QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review has explored the fundamental principles of thermal field theory in the context of a background magnetic field, highlighting its theoretical framework and some of its applications to the thermo-magnetic QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. Our discussion has been limited to equilibrium systems for clarity and conciseness. We analyzed bulk thermodynamic characteristics including the phase diagram as well as real-time observables, shedding light on the behaviour and dynamics of the thermo-magnetic QCD medium relevant to heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>Goldilocks and the bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study simplified bootstrap problems for probability distributions on the infinite line and the circle. We show that the rapid convergence of the bootstrap method for problems on the infinite line is related to the fact that the smallest eigenvalue of the positive matrices in the exact solution becomes exponentially small for large matrices, while the moments grow factorially. As a result, the positivity condition is very finely tuned. For problems on the circle we show instead that the entries of the positive matrix of Fourier modes of the distribution depend linearly on the initial data of the recursion, with factorially growing coefficients. By positivity, these matrix elements are bounded in absolute value by one, so the initial data must also be fine-tuned. Additionally, we find that we can largely bypass the semi-definite program (SDP) nature of the problem on a circle by recognizing that these Fourier modes must be asymptotically exponentially small. With a simple ansatz, which we call the shoestring bootstrap, we can efficiently identify an interior point of the set of allowed matrices with much higher precision than conventional SDP bounds permit. We apply this method to solving unitary matrix model integrals by numerically constructing the orthogonal polynomials associated with the circle distribution.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in Hyperbolic Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body chaos and scrambling in the Hyperbolic Ising model, a mixed-field Ising model living in the background of AdS2. The effect of the curvature is captured by site-dependent couplings obtained from the AdS2 metric applied to a flat nearest neighbor spin chain. We show that this model with only local site-dependent nearest neighbor interactions is maximally chaotic, can be classified as a fast scrambler, and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound on chaos for a certain set of parameters, thus making this model one of the few if not the only example where such fast scrambling behavior has been seen without all-to-all or long-range interactions. Moreover, the modest resources needed to simulate this model make it an ideal test-bed for studying scrambling and chaos on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exploring fully-heavy tetraquarks through the CGAN framework: Mass and width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully-heavy tetraquark states, $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{Q} (Q=c,b)$, have garnered significant attention both experimentally and theoretically, due to their unique properties and potential to provide new insights into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this study, we employ Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to predict the masses and decay widths of fully-heavy tetraquarks. To deepen our understanding of heavy multiquark structures, we prepare datasets based on two distinct approaches and train the CGAN model using both. The CGAN framework allows us to capture the complex relationships between input features, such as quark content, quantum numbers, and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and output properties, including mass and decay width. Our predictions, based on the CGAN framework, are consistent with existing data. By combining fundamental knowledge of QCD with advanced machine learning techniques, this work represents a significant step forward in the theoretical understanding of fully-heavy tetraquark states. Our CGAN approach has the potential to become a strong contender for future studies in heavy tetraquark systems, complementing existing theoretical models to deliver more precise results. Additionally, our findings could assist in the search for fully-heavy tetraquark systems in future experiments.</description>

      <title>A novel strategy to prove chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the confining regime of QCD-like theories with $N_c$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. Our proof is based on a novel strategy, called `downlifting', by which solutions of the 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for a theory with $N_f-1$ flavors are constructed from those of a theory with $N_f$ flavors, while $N_c$ is fixed. By induction, chiral symmetry breaking is proven for any $N_f\geq p_{min}$ in the confining regime, where $p_{min}$ is the smallest prime factor of $N_c$. The proof can be extended to $N_f &lt;p_{min}$ under the additional assumption on the absence of phase transitions when quark masses are sent to infinity. Our results do not rely on assumptions on the spectrum of massless bound states other than the fact that they are color-singlet hadrons.</description>

      <title>Exact relations between running of $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD-like theories we derive the (all-order) exact equations relating the renormalization group behaviour of the strong and electromagnetic couplings and prove that they are valid in the HD+MSL renormalization prescription. In particular, the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD can be expressed in terms of the Adler $D$-function. If all favors have the same absolute value of the electromagnetic charges, it is also possible to write a simple relation between the $\beta$-functions for the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. In this particular case there is a special renormalization group invariant relation.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>
