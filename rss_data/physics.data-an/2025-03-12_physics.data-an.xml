      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPARKX is an open-source Python package developed to analyze simulation data from heavy-ion collision experiments. By offering a comprehensive suite of tools, SPARKX simplifies data analysis workflows, supports multiple formats such as OSCAR2013, and integrates seamlessly with SMASH and JETSCAPE/X-SCAPE. This paper describes SPARKX's architecture, features, and applications and demonstrates its effectiveness through detailed examples and performance benchmarks. SPARKX enhances productivity and precision in relativistic kinematics studies.</description>

      <title>Towards High Precision Mass Measurements of Two Sub-Neptunes in the K2-266 Planetary System Through Transit Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes have been found to be one of the most common types of exoplanets, yet their physical parameters and properties are poorly determined and in need of further investigation. In order to improve the mass measurement and parameter determination of two sub-Neptunes, K2-266 d and K2-266 e, we present new transit observations obtained with CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), increasing the baseline of transit data from a few epochs to 165 epochs for K2-266 d, and to 121 epochs for K2-266 e. Through a two-stage fitting process, it is found that the masses of K2-266 d and K2-266 e are 6.01$\pm$0.43 $M_\oplus$ and 7.70$\pm$0.58 $M_\oplus$, respectively. With these updated values and one order of magnitude better precision, we confirm the planets to belong to the population of planets that has been determined to be volatile-rich. Finally, we present the results of dynamical simulations, showing that the system is stable, the orbits are not chaotic, and that these two planets are close to but not in 4:3 mean motion resonance.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Full Event Interpretation: a graph neural network for event reconstruction in Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the Graph-based Full Event Interpretation (GraFEI), a machine learning model based on graph neural networks to inclusively reconstruct events in the Belle~II experiment. Belle~II is well suited to perform measurements of $B$ meson decays involving invisible particles (e.g. neutrinos) in the final state. The kinematical properties of such particles can be deduced from the energy-momentum imbalance obtained after reconstructing the companion $B$ meson produced in the event. This task is performed by reconstructing it either from all the particles in an event but the signal tracks, or using the Full Event Interpretation, an algorithm based on Boosted Decision Trees and limited to specific, hard-coded decay processes. A recent example involving the use of the aforementioned techniques is the search for the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ decay, that provided an evidence for this process at about 3 standard deviations. The GraFEI model is trained to predict the structure of the decay chain by exploiting the information from the detected final state particles only, without making use of any prior assumptions about the underlying event. By retaining only signal-like decay topologies, the model considerably reduces the amount of background while keeping a relatively high signal efficiency. The performances of the model when applied to the search for $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Framework and Optimal Projection of Weather Fields for Prediction of Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme events are the major weather-related hazard for humanity. It is then of crucial importance to have a good understanding of their statistics and to be able to forecast them. However, lack of sufficient data makes their study particularly challenging. In this work, we provide a simple framework for studying extreme events that tackles the lack of data issue by using the entire available dataset, rather than focusing on the extremes of the dataset. To do so, we make the assumption that the set of predictors and the observable used to define the extreme event follow a jointly Gaussian distribution. This naturally gives the notion of an optimal projection of the predictors for forecasting the event. We take as a case study extreme heatwaves over France, and we test our method on an 8000-year-long intermediate complexity climate model time series and on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. For a-posteriori statistics, we observe and motivate the fact that composite maps of very extreme events look similar to less extreme ones. For prediction, we show that our method is competitive with off-the-shelf neural networks on the long dataset and outperforms them on reanalysis. The optimal projection pattern, which makes our forecast intrinsically interpretable, highlights the importance of soil moisture deficit and quasi-stationary Rossby waves as precursors to extreme heatwaves.</description>
