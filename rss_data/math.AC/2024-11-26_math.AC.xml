      <title>On the atomicity of one-dimensional monoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ascending chain condition on principal ideals (ACCP) is almost always complementary to atomicity within integral domains: in fact, Cohn initially stated that these two conditions were equivalent. This assertion has been shown to be false, however most counterexamples require technical algebraic constructions. In 2017, Gotti conjectured that for every $q$ in the set $S := ((0, 1) \cap \mathbb{Q}) \setminus {\mathbb{N}}^{-1}_{&gt; 1}$, atomicity ascends from the exponentially cyclic Puiseux monoid $M_q$ to its monoid algebra over the field of rationals. If this conjecture were true, it would provide an extremely wide class of atomic domains of Krull dimension one not satisfying the ACCP, and so would be perhaps the simplest possible such examples. Bu et al. recently proved that the monoid algebra $\mathbb{Q} \left[M_{3/4} \right]$ is atomic, marking the first progress towards settling this conjecture. We strengthen this result and prove that $\mathbb{Q}[M_q]$ is atomic for all $q \in S$ having an odd denominator.</description>

      <title>Polyominoes and Knutson ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study two fundamental questions on polyomino ideals which are radicality and primality. In order to study the question of radicality, we initiate the study of Knutson ideals among polyominoes. Knutson ideals were introduced by Conca and Varbaro after the work of Knutson on compatibly split ideals. Knutson ideals are known to have nice properties, for example, they are well behaved with Gr\"{o}bner bases, and it has square-free initial ideals; hence they are radical.
  We show that polyomino ideals associated with closed path, weakly closed path, simple thin, and ladder polyominoes are Knutson. We also show that polyomino ideals associated with a class of thin polyominoes are Knutson; hence they are radical. In fact, we show that these polyomino ideals are prime and the reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis is computed. Furthermore, we prove that under a certain condition, if a parallelogram polyomino is extracted from another parallelogram polyomino, the resulting collection of cells is Knutson. We also compute their Gr\"{o}bner basis.</description>

      <title>Generalised Buchberger and Schreyer algorithms for strongly discrete coherent rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let M be a finitely generated submodule of a free module over a multivariate polynomial ring with coefficients in a discrete coherent ring. We prove that its module MLT(M ) of leading terms is countably generated and provide an algorithm for computing explicitly a generating set. This result is also useful when MLT(M ) is not finitely generated. Suppose that the base ring is strongly discrete coherent. We provide a Buchberger-like algorithm and prove that it converges if, and only if, the module of leading terms is finitely generated. We also provide a constructive version of Hilbert's syzygy theorem by following Schreyer's method.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Modules and Scott Sheaves on a Continuous Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing domain theory, we generalize the notion of an ephemeral module to the so-called continuous posets. We investigate the quotient category of persistence modules by the Serre subcategory of ephemeral modules and show that it is equivalent to the category of sheaves on the Scott topology. Furthermore, we study the metric properties of persistence modules via this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Priors for Boundary Value Problems of Linear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental task in computational science, traditionally addressed by numerical solvers. Recent advancements have introduced neural operators and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle PDEs, achieving reduced computational costs at the expense of solution quality and accuracy. Gaussian processes (GPs) have also been applied to linear PDEs, with the advantage of always yielding precise solutions. In this work, we propose Boundary Ehrenpreis-Palamodov Gaussian Processes (B-EPGPs), a novel framework for constructing GP priors that satisfy both general systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients and linear boundary conditions. We explicitly construct GP priors for representative PDE systems with practical boundary conditions. Formal proofs of correctness are provided and empirical results demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art neural operator approaches.</description>

      <title>DG singular equivalence and singular locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R$, we construct an affine scheme $X$ solely from DG singularity category $S_{dg}(R)$ of $R$ such that there is a finite surjective morphism $X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$, where $\mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$ is the singular locus in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. As an application, for two such rings with equivalent DG singularity categories, we prove that the singular loci in their affine schemes have the same dimension.</description>

      <title>A module-theoretic characterization of $S$-($w$-)Noetherian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14781v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$. In this paper, we obtain the ACC characterization, Cartan-Eilenberg-Bass theorem and the absolutely pure characterization for $S$-Noetherian rings. In details, we show that a ring $R$ is an $S$-Noetherian ring if and only if any ascending chain of ideals of $R$ is $S$-stationary, if and only if any direct sum of injective modules is $s$-injective, if and only if any direct limit of injective modules is $s$-injective. We also characterized $S$-$w$-Noetherian rings similarly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a characterization of F-rationality in terms of tight closure of products of parameter ideals. Our results are inspired by the theory of complete ideals for surfaces and, in particular, the fundamental results of Lipman-Teissier and Cutkosky characterizing rational surface singularities in terms of products of complete ideals, but are valid also in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Some new module-theoretic characterizations of $S$-Noetherian rings and $S$-coherent rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$. In this paper, we first introduce and study the notions of $s$-pure exact sequences and $s$-absolutely pure modules which extend the classical notions of pure exact sequences and absolutely pure modules. And then, we give some new characterizations of $S$-Noetherian rings and $S$-coherent rings in terms of $s$-absolutely pure modules.</description>
