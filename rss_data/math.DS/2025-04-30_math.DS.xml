      <title>When Periodicity Fails to Guarantee the Existence of Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a simple counterexample of a smooth $C^{\infty}$ periodic system modulo $\mathbb{Z}^3$, where the rotation vector exists only in the weak sense and not in the strong sense (also referred to as frequencies in physics and biology). This example highlights the subtle yet important distinction between these two concepts of rotation vectors in the context of periodic flows. It also raises open questions regarding the role of arithmetic properties, such as Liouville numbers, in the dynamics of such systems, pointing to areas for future research in the theory of oscillating systems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Studies on Additional Food Provided Prey-Predator Systems with Group Defence among Prey and Mutual Interference among Predators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of competition and additional food on prey-predator dynamics has attracted considerable interest from mathematical biology researchers in recent times. In this study, we consider an additional food provided prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-IV functional response among mutually interferring predators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the proposed model. We study the existence and stability of equilibrium points and further explored bifurcations with respect to the additional food and competition. We further study the global dynamics of the system and discuss the consequences of providing additional food. Later, we do the time-optimal control studies with respect to the quality and quantity of additional food as control variables by transforming the independent variable in the control system. Making use of the Pontraygin maximum principle, we characterize the optimal quality of additional food and optimal quantity of additional food. We further enhanced the model by incorpoating both continuous and discrete noise. We further characterized and numerically simulated the stochastic optimal controls through Sufficient Stochastic Maximum Principle. We show that the findings of these dynamics and control studies have the potential to be applied to a variety of problems in pest management.</description>

      <title>Topology of univoque sets in double-base expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two real numbers $q_0,q_1&gt;1$ satisfying $q_0+q_1\geq q_0q_1$ and two real numbers $d_0\ne d_1$, by a {double-base expansion} of a real number $x$ we mean a sequence $(i_k)\in \{0,1\}^{\infty}$ such that \begin{equation*} x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{d_{i_k}}{q_{{i_1}}q_{{i_2}}\cdots q_{{i_k}}}. \end{equation*} We denote by $\mathcal{U}_{{q_0,q_1}}$ the set of numbers $x$ having a unique expansion. The topological properties of $\mathcal{U}_{{q_0,q_1}}$ have been investigated in the equal-base case $q_0=q_1$ for a long time. We extend this research to the case $q_0\neq q_1$. While many results remain valid, a great number of new phenomena appear due to the increased complexity of double-base expansions.</description>

      <title>Resonance in isochronous systems with decaying oscillatory and stochastic perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined influence of oscillatory excitations and multiplicative stochastic perturbations of white noise type on isochronous systems in the plane is investigated. It is assumed that the intensity of perturbations decays with time and the excitation frequency satisfies a resonance condition. The occurrence and stochastic stability of solutions with an asymptotically constant amplitude are discussed. By constructing an averaging transformation, we derive a model truncated deterministic system that describes possible asymptotic regimes for perturbed solutions. The persistence of resonant solutions in the phase locking and the phase drifting modes is justified by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions for the complete stochastic system. In particular, we show that decaying stochastic perturbations can shift the boundary of stability domain for resonant solutions.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of linear systems with multiple unknown time-varying input delays by linear time-varying feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stabilization of linear systems with multiple time-varying input delays. In scenarios where neither the exact delays information nor their bound is known, we propose a class of linear time-varying state feedback controllers by using the solution to a parametric Lyapunov equation (PLE). By leveraging the properties of the solution to the PLE and constructing a time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like functional, we prove that (the zero solution of) the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Furthermore, this result is extended to the observer-based output feedback case. The notable characteristic of these controllers is their utilization of linear time-varying gains. Furthermore, they are designed entirely independent of any knowledge of the time delays, resulting in controllers that are exceedingly easy to implement. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>N-body choreographies on a p-limacon curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $N$--body problem under a harmonic potential of the form $\frac{1}{2}\sum \kappa_{jl} |q_j-q_l|^2$. A $p$-lima\c{c}on curve is a planar curve parametrized by $t$ given by $a(\cos t,\sin t)+b(\cos pt, \sin pt)$, where $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$, $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $t \in [0,2\pi]$. We study $N$-body choreographic motions constrained to a $p$-lima\c{c}on curve and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence. Specifically, we prove that choreographic motions exist if and only if $p/N, (p \pm 1)/N \notin \mathbb{Z}$. Under an additional symmetry assumption on the force coefficients, we further refine these conditions. We also analyze the occurrence of collisions, showing that for given $p$ and $N$, at most $2(N-1)$ choices of $a/b$ lead to collisions. Furthermore, we find additional conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional horseshoes near an unfolding of a Hopf-Hopf singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a certain type of unfolding of a Hopf-Hopf singularity, we consider a one-parameter family $(f_\gamma)_{\gamma\geq0}$ of $C^3$--vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^4$ whose flows exhibit a heteroclinic cycle associated to two periodic solutions and a bifocus, all of them hyperbolic. It is formally proved that combining rotation with a generic condition concerning the transverse intersection between the three-dimensional invariant manifolds of the periodic solutions, all sets are highly distorted by the first return map and hyperbolic three-dimensional horseshoes emerge, accumulating on the network. Infinitely many linked horseshoes prompt the coexistence of infinitely many saddle-type invariant sets for all values of $\gamma\gtrsim 0$ belonging to the heteroclinic class of the two hyperbolic periodic solutions. We apply the results to a particular unfolding of the Hopf-Hopf singularity, the so called \emph{Gaspard-type unfolding}.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part I: non-rotating floes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive modeling framework for the dynamics of sea ice floes using particle, kinetic, and hydrodynamic approaches. Building upon the foundational work of Ha and Tadmor on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, we derive a Vlasov-type kinetic formulation and a corresponding hydrodynamic description. The particle model incorporates essential physical properties of sea ice floes, including size, position, velocity, and interactions governed by Newtonian mechanics. By extending these principles, the kinetic model captures large-scale features through the phase-space distribution, and we also present a hydrodynamic model using the velocity moments and a suitable closure condition. In this paper, as an idea-introductory step, we assume that ice floes are non-rotating and focus on the linear velocity dynamics. Our approach highlights the role of contact forces, ocean drag effects, and conservation laws in the multiscale description of sea ice dynamics, offering a pathway for the improved understanding and prediction of sea ice behaviors in changing climatic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article covers the continuous McKendrick model, which is key in epidemiology and population dynamics, developed by Anderson Gray McKendrick. It describes population age structure changes via birth and death rates as continuous functions, shedding light on population dynamics through differential equations. The article delves into the equations, boundary conditions, and survival rates, offering insights into disease progression and population dynamics. It aims for an asymptotic analysis of population dynamics using previous studies and illustrative examples. The main finding is that the population nears extinction only if the expected offspring per individual ($R$) is less than 1.</description>

      <title>Iterated function systems of holomorphic maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify and advance a host of works on iterated function systems of holomorphic self-maps of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. Our foremost result is a generalisation to left iterated function systems of an unpublished and little known theorem of Heins on iteration in the unit disc. Applications abound -- to work of Benini et al on transcendental dynamics, to the theory of hyperbolic steps of holomorphic maps, and to left semiconjugacy in the unit disc. We extend other work of Benini et al and Ferreira on relatively compact left iterated functions, and we prove a hyperbolic distance inequality for holomorphic maps that generalises a theorem of Bracci, Kraus, and Roth. Additionally, we strengthen results of the first author and Christodoulou on left iterated function systems, removing the need for Bloch domains, and we answer an open question from their work. Finally, we establish a version of the Heins theorem for right iterated functions systems, and we generalise theorems of Beardon and Kuznetsov on right iterated function systems in relatively compact semigroups of holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>On $L^\alpha$-flatness of Erd\H{o}s-Littlewood's polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that Erd\"{o}s--Littlewood's polynomials are not $L^\alpha$-flat when $\alpha &gt; 2$ is an even integer (and hence for any $\alpha \geq 4$). This provides a partial solution to an old problem posed by Littlewood. Consequently, we obtain a positive answer to the analogous Erd\"{o}s--Newman conjecture for polynomials with coefficients $\pm 1$; that is, there is no ultraflat sequence of polynomials from the class of Erd\"{o}s--Littlewood polynomials.
  Our proof is short and simple. It relies on the classical lemma for $L^p$ norms of the Dirichlet kernel, the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund interpolation inequalities, and the $p$-concentration theorem due to A. Bonami and S. R\'ev\'esz.</description>

      <title>Discrete Generating Series and Linear Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define discrete generating series for arbitrary functions \( f \colon \mathbb{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \) and derive functional relations that these series satisfy. For linear difference equations with constant coefficients, we establish explicit functional equations linking the generating series to the initial data, and for equations with polynomial coefficients, we introduce an analogue of Stanley's \( D \)-finiteness criterion, proving that a discrete generating series is \( D \)-finite if and only if the corresponding sequence is polynomially recursive. The framework is further generalized to multidimensional settings, where we investigate the interplay between discrete generating series and solutions to Cauchy problems for difference equations. Key structural properties are uncovered through the introduction of polynomial shift operators and projection techniques. The theory is illustrated with concrete examples, including the Tribonacci recurrence and Schr\"oder's second problem.</description>

Abstract: We enumerate the ends of each stratum of meromorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces with prescribed multiplicities of zeroes and poles. Our proof uses degeneration techniques based on the construction by Bainbridge-Chen-Gendron-Grushevsky-Moeller of the moduli space of multi-scale differentials, together with recent classification of connected components of generalized strata by Lee-Wong. In particular, from these results we quickly deduce the theorem for holomorphic 1-forms, originally proved by Boissy.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Lorentzian quasi-Fuchsian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional quasi-Fuchsian Lorentzian manifold $M$ is a globally hyperbolic spacetime diffeomorphic to $\Sigma\times (-1,1)$ for a closed orientable surface $\Sigma$ of genus $\geq 2$. It is the quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash \Omega_\Gamma$ of an open set $\Omega_\Gamma\subset {\rm AdS}_3$ by a discrete group $\Gamma$ of isometries of ${\rm AdS}_3$ which is a particular example of an Anosov representation of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$. We first show that the spacelike geodesic flow of $M$ is Axiom A, has a discrete Ruelle resonance spectrum with associated (co-)resonant states, and that the Poincar\'e series for $\Gamma$ extend meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$. This is then used to prove that there is a natural notion of resolvent of the pseudo-Riemannian Laplacian $\Box$ of $M$, which is meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ with poles of finite rank, defining a notion of quantum resonances and quantum resonant states related to the Ruelle resonances and (co-)resonant states by a quantum-classical correspondence. This initiates the spectral study of convex co-compact pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For uniform lattices $\Gamma$ in rank 1 Lie groups, we construct Anosov representations of virtual doubles of $\Gamma$ along certain quasiconvex subgroups. We also show that virtual HNN extensions of these lattices over some cyclic subgroups admit Anosov embeddings. In addition, we prove that for any Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a real semisimple linear Lie group $\mathsf{G}$ and any infinite abelian subgroup $\mathrm{H} $ of $ \Gamma$, there exists a finite-index subgroup $\Gamma' $ of $ \Gamma$ containing $\mathrm{H}$ such that the double $\Gamma' *_{\mathrm{H}} \Gamma'$ admits an Anosov representation, thereby confirming a conjecture of [arXiv:2112.05574]. These results yield numerous examples of one-ended hyperbolic groups that do not admit discrete and faithful representations into rank 1 Lie groups but do admit Anosov embeddings into higher-rank Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Observability of complex systems via conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many systems in biology, physics, and engineering are modeled by nonlinear dynamical systems where the states are usually unknown and only a subset of the state variables can be physically measured. Can we understand the full system from what we measure? In the mathematics literature, this question is framed as the observability problem. It has to do with recovering information about the state variables from the observed states (the measurements). In this paper, we relate the observability problem to another structural feature of many models relevant in the physical and biological sciences: the conserved quantity. For models based on systems of differential equations, conserved quantities offer desirable properties such as dimension reduction which simplifies model analysis. Here, we use differential embeddings to show that conserved quantities involving a set of special variables provide more flexibility in what can be measured to address the observability problem for systems of interest in biology. Specifically, we provide conditions under which a collection of conserved quantities make the system observable. We apply our methods to provide alternate measurable variables in models where conserved quantities have been used for model analysis historically in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Hausdorff dimension estimates for conformal fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework which allows us to rigorously estimate the Hausdorff dimension of maximal conformal graph directed Markov systems in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 2$. Our method is based on piecewise linear approximations of the eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator via a finite element framework for discretization and iterative mesh schemes. One key element in our approach is obtaining bounds for the derivatives of these eigenfunctions, which, besides being essential for the implementation of our method, are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Geometric decomposition of planar vector fields with a limit cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling is a cornerstone of computational biology. While mechanistic models might describe the interactions of interest of a system, they are often difficult to study. On the other hand, abstract models might capture key features but remain disconnected from experimental manipulation. Geometric methods have been useful in connecting both approaches, although they have only been established for specific type of systems. Phenomena of biological relevance, such as limit cycles, are still difficult to study using conventional methods. In this paper, I explore an alternative description of planar dynamical systems and I present an algorithm to compute numerically the geometric structure of planar systems with a limit cycle.</description>

      <title>On $k$-summable normal forms of vector fields with one zero eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study normal forms of analytic saddle-nodes in $\mathbb C^{n+1}$ with any Poincar\'e rank $k\in \mathbb N$. The approach and the results generalize those of Bonckaert and De Maesschalck from 2008 that considered $k=1$. In particular, we introduce a Banach convolutional algebra that is tailored to study differential equations in the Borel plane of order $k$. One of the subtleties that we take care of in this paper, is that nontrivial Jordan blocks are allowed in the linear part of the vector field. We anticipate that our approach can stimulate new research and be used to study different normal forms in future work.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and stability of synchronized solutions in the Kuramoto model with uniformly spaced natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical Kuramoto model (KM) with natural frequencies and its continuum limit (CL), and discuss the existence of synchronized solutions and their bifurcations and stability. We specifically assume that the frequency function is symmetric and linear in the CL, so that the natural frequencies are evenly spaced in the KM. We show that in the KM, $O(2^n)$ one-parameter families of synchronized solutions are born and $O(2^n)$ saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations occur at least, when the node number $n$ is odd and tends to infinity. Moreover, we prove that the family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work suffers a saddle-node bifurcation at which its stability changes from asymptotically stable to unstable and the other families of synchronized solutions are unstable in the KM. For the CL, we show that a one-parameter family of continuous synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work is asymptotically stable and that there exist uncountably many one-parameter families of discontinuous synchronized solutions and they are unstable along with another one-parameter family of continuous synchronized solutions.</description>

      <title>On Finiteness of Stationary Configurations of the Planar Five-vortex Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.11975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finiteness problem of stationary configurations for the planar five-vortex problem is considered in this paper. The numbers of equilibria and rigidly translating configurations are shown to be at most 6 and 24 respectively. The numbers of relative equilibria and collapse configurations are shown to be finite, except perhaps if the 5-tuple of vorticities belongs to a given codimension 2 subvariety of the vorticity space. In particular, if the vorticities are of the same sign, the number of stationary configurations is finite.</description>

      <title>Liouville-Arnold theorem for homogeneous symplectic and contact Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian system is completely integrable (in the sense of Liouville) if there exist as many independent integrals of motion in involution as the dimension of the configuration space. Under certain regularity conditions, Liouville-Arnold theorem states that the invariant geometric structure associated with Liouville integrability is a fibration by Lagrangian tori (or, more generally, Abelian Lie groups), on which the motion is linear. In this paper, a Liouville-Arnold theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems is proven. More specifically, it is shown that, given a $(2n+1)$-dimensional completely integrable contact system, one can construct a foliation by $(n+1)$-dimensional Abelian Lie groups and induce action-angle coordinates in which the equations of motion are linearized. One important novelty with respect to previous attempts is that the foliation consists of $(n+1)$-dimensional coisotropic submanifolds given by the preimages of rays by the functions in involution. In order to prove the theorem, we first develop a version of Liouville-Arnold theorem for homogeneous functions on exact symplectic manifolds (which is of independent interest), and then apply the symplectization to obtain the contact case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a theory of "sublinearly Morse boundary" and prove a corresponding sublinearly Morse lemma in higher rank symmetric space of non-compact type. This is motivated by the work of Kapovich-Leeb-Porti and the theory of sublinearly Morse quasi-geodesics developed in the context of CAT(0) geometry.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Clustering in Mean-Field Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a cohomological criterion for certain decomposition of Borel graphs, which is an analog of Dunwoody's work on accessibility of groups. As an application, we prove that a Borel graph $(X,G)$ with uniformly bounded degrees of cohomological dimension one is Lipschitz equivalent to a Borel acyclic graph on $X$. This gives a new proof of a result of Chen-Poulin-Tao-Tserunyan on Borel graphs with components quasi-isometric to trees.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969). In this work, we develop a new approach towards effectivising the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods extend to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). In addition, we prove a central limit theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>
