      <title>Magnetic-field-tunable anisotropic black-body radiation in dynamical axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antiferromagnetic order breaking simultaneously the time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries in topological insulators might give rise to dynamical axion-like fields in the form of longitudinal spin waves. The consequences of the associated axion-polariton state on the thermal radiation are investigated. Planck's radiation law is shown to exhibit remarkable anisotropic behavior as a result of the strong refraction caused by the heat-matter interaction. A crossover scenario at low temperature is identified and an associated regime in which the system's internal energy does not scale with the traditional fourth power of the temperature is revealed. We show that the polarization purity of the heat radiation and its angular distribution can be controlled via the magnetic field, paving the way toward a directional-tunable mechanism for thermal quanta manipulation and storage.</description>

      <title>Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a Majorana qubit in a quantum dot-superconductor array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance -- longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.</description>

      <title>Light-induced quantum tunnelling current in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, advancements in attosecond spectroscopy have allowed us to study electron motion dynamics in condensed matter. The access to these electron dynamics and, consequently, its control by an ultrafast light field paves the way for establishing ultrafast optoelectronics. Here, we report the generation of light-induced quantum tunnelling current in graphene phototransistors by ultrafast laser pulses in an ambient environment. This tunnelling effect provides access to the instantaneous field-driven current to demonstrate the current switching (ON and OFF) on a 630 attosecond (1.6 petahertz speed). Moreover, we controlled the tunnelling current and enhanced the graphene phototransistor conductivity by controlling the density of the photoexcited charge carriers at different pump laser powers. Furthermore, we exploited this capability to demonstrate various logic gates. The demonstrated light-induced tunnelling current and ultrafast switching were attained under standard room temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, the presented scientific advancement in this work is at the technology readiness level suitable for its immediate integration into the development of ultrafast, nearly six orders of magnitude faster, optical transistors, lightwave electronics, and optical quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Studying Critical Parameters of Superconductor via Diamond Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical parameters are the key to superconductivity research, and reliable instrumentations can facilitate the study. Traditionally, one has to use several different measurement techniques to measure critical parameters separately. In this work, we develop the use of a single species of quantum sensor to determine and estimate several critical parameters with the help of independent simulation data. We utilize the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the diamond, which recently emerged as a promising candidate for probing exotic features in condensed matter physics. The non-invasive and highly stable nature provides extraordinary opportunities to solve scientific problems in various systems. Using a high-quality single-crystalline YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{4}$O$_{8}$ (YBCO) as a platform, we demonstrate the use of diamond particles and a bulk diamond to probe the Meissner effect. The evolution of the vector magnetic field, the $H-T$ phase diagram, and the map of fluorescence contour are studied via NV sensing. Our results reveal different critical parameters, including lower critical field $H_{c1}$, upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and critical current density $j_{c}$, as well as verifying the unconventional nature of this high-temperature superconductor YBCO. Therefore, NV-based quantum sensing techniques have huge potential in condensed matter research.</description>

      <title>Colossal Magnon Magnetoresistance of Two-Dimensional Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnon current holds substantial importance in facilitating the transfer of angular momentum in spin-based electronics. However, the magnon current in three-dimensional magnetic materials remains orders of magnitude too small for applications. In contrast, magnon numbers in two-dimensional systems exhibit significant enhancement and are markedly influenced by external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the magnon current in a two-dimensional easy-axis ferromagnet and find a colossal magnon magnetoresistance (CMMR) effect, wherein the change of the magnon conductance can reach as high as a thousand percent in a moderate magnetic field. Moreover, the magnitude of the CMMR exhibits significant dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field due to the interplay between magnon- conserving and non-conserving scattering. We propose a non-local magnon-mediated electrical drag experiment for the possible experimental observation of the predicted effect. With the CMMR effect and a much larger magnon number, magnon current in 2D materials shows promise as a primary source for spin transport in spintronics devices.9</description>

      <title>Selective and Quasi-continuous Switching of Ferroelectric Chern Insulator Device for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge state transport in quantum materials is dissipationless and features quantized Hall conductance, and shows great potential in highly fault-tolerant computing technologies. However, it remains elusive about how to develop topological edge state-based computing devices. Recently, exploration and understanding of interfacial ferroelectricity in various van der Waals heterostructure material systems have received widespread attention among the community of materials science and condensed matter physics3-11. Such ferroelectric polarization emergent at the vdW interface can coexist with other quantum states and thus provides an unprecedented opportunity to electrically switch the topological edge states of interest, which is of crucial significance to the fault-tolerant electronic device applications based on the topological edge states. Here, we report the selective and quasi-continuous ferroelectric switching of topological Chern insulator devices and demonstrate its promising application in noise-immune neuromorphic computing. We fabricate this ferroelectric Chern insulator device by encapsulating magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with doubly-aligned h-BN layers, and observe the coexistence of the interfacial ferroelectricity and the topological Chern insulating states. This ferroelectricity exhibits an anisotropic dependence on the in-plane magnetic field. By using a VBG pulse with delicately controlled amplitude, we realize the nonvolatile switching between any pair of Chern insulating states and achieve 1280 distinguishable nonvolatile resistance levels on a single device. Furthermore, we demonstrate deterministic switching between two arbitrary levels among the record-high number of nonvolatile resistance levels.</description>

      <title>Distinct moir\'e trions in a twisted semiconductor homobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fascinating properties discovered in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices originate from flat bands and enhanced many-body effects. Here, we discover new many-electron excited states in TMD homobilayers. As optical resonances evolve with twist angle and doping in MoSe$_2$ bilayers, a unique type of ``charge-transfer" trions is observed when gradual changes in atomic alignment between the layers occur. In real space, the optically excited electron-hole pair mostly resides in a different site from the doped hole in a moir\'e supercell. In momentum space, the electron-hole pair forms in the single-particle-band $K$-valley, while the hole occupies the $\Gamma$-valley. The rich internal structure of this trion resonance arises from the ultra-flatness of the first valence band and the distinct influence of moir\'e potential modulation on holes and excitons. Our findings open new routes to realizing photon-spin transduction or implementing moir\'e quantum simulators with independently tunable fermion and boson densities.</description>

      <title>Current-driven mechanical motion of double stranded DNA results in structural instabilities and chiral-induced-spin-selectivity of electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral-induced-spin-selectivity of electron transport and its interplay with DNA's mechanical motion is explored in a double stranded DNA helix with spin-orbit-coupling. The mechanical degree of freedom is treated as a stochastic classical variable experiencing fluctuations and dissipation induced by the environment as well as force exerted by nonequilibrium, current-carrying electrons. Electronic degrees of freedom are described quantum mechanically using nonequilibrium Green's functions. Nonequilibrium Green's functions are computed along the trajectory for the classical variable taking into account dynamical, velocity dependent corrections. This mixed quantum-classical approach enables calculations of time-dependent spin-resolved currents. We showed that the electronic force may significantly modify the classical potential which, at sufficient voltage, creates a bistable potential with considerable effect on electronic transport. The DNA's mechanical motion has a profound effect on spin transport; it results in chiral-induced spin selectivity increasing spin polarisation of the current by 9% and also resulting in temperature-dependent current voltage characteristics. We demonstrate that the current noise measurement provides an accessible experimental means to monitor the emergence of mechanical instability in DNA motion. The spin resolved current noise also provides important dynamical information about the interplay between vibrational and spin degrees of freedom in DNA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformation, defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>

      <title>Twist-tunable spin control in twisted bilayer bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer structures have emerged as a fascinating arena in condensed matter thanks to their highly tunable physics. The role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in twisted bilayers has gained increasing attention due to its potential for spintronics. Thus, it is appealing to propose new materials for constructing twisted bilayers with substantial SOC. In this work, the intriguing effects induced by twisting two layers of two-dimensional bismuthene are unraveled from large-scale first-principles calculations. We show that spin-orbit coupling significantly affects the electronic properties of twisted bilayer bismuthene, even more than in its untwisted counterpart. We carefully investigate how the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the twist angle impacts the band structure and spin textures of twisted bilayer bismuthene. We find that the twist angle can be deemed a control knob to switch from a small-gap semiconductor to a metallic behavior. Most crucially, the accurate analysis of the energy bands close to Fermi energy reveals a twist-tunable splitting in the mexican-hat shape of the bands that can otherwise be obtained only by applying enormous electric fields. Our predictions provide insight into innovative bismuth-based technologies for future spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum description of Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Weyl semimetal (WSM) in a magnetic field, a semiclassical description of the Fermi-arc surface state dynamics is usually employed for explaining various unconventional magnetotransport phenomena, e.g., Weyl orbits, the three-dimensional Quantum Hall Effect, and the high transmission through twisted WSM interfaces. For a half-space geometry, we determine the low-energy quantum eigenstates for a four-band model of a WSM in a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface. The eigenstates correspond to in- and out-going chiral Landau level (LL) states, propagating (anti-)parallel to the field direction near different Weyl nodes, which are coupled by evanescent surface-state contributions generated by all other LLs. These replace the Fermi arc in a magnetic field. Computing the phase shift accumulated between in- and out-going chiral LL states, we compare our quantum-mechanical results to semiclassical predictions. We find quantitative agreement between both approaches.</description>

      <title>Influence of surface relaxations on atomic-resolution imaging of a charge density wave material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy is the method of choice for characterizing charge density waves by imaging the variation in atomic-scale contrast of the surface. Due to the measurement principle of scanning tunneling microscopy, the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are convoluted, making it difficult to disentangle a structural displacement from spatial variations in the electronic structure. In this work, we quantify the influence of the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms on the 3 x 3 charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images of 2H-NbSe2. In scanning tunneling microscopy images, we observe the 3 x 3 charge density wave superstructure and atomic lattice at all probed tip-sample distances. In contrast, non-contact atomic force microscopy images show both periodicities only at small tip-sample distances while, unexpectedly, a 3 x 3 superstructure is present at larger tip-sample distances. Using density functional theory calculations, we qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings and reveal that the 3 x 3 superstructure at different tip-sample distances in non-contact atomic force microscopy images is a result from different underlying interactions. In addition, we show that the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms has a negligible influence to the contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy images. Our work presents a method on how to discriminate the influence of the surface corrugation from the variation of the charge density to the charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images, which can foster the understanding of the charge density wave mechanism in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Details: Complexity Powered Machine Intelligent Classification of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and classifying quantum phases from measurable time series in many-body dynamics have significant values, yet face formidable challenges, requiring profound knowledge of physicists. Here, to achieve a pure data-driven machine intelligent classification, we introduce a complexity boosted distance measure that captures the inherent complexity of dynamic evolution series in different quantum many-body phases. Significantly, the introduction of complexity-boosted distance leads to remarkable improvements of unsupervised manifold learning of quantum many-body dynamics, which are exemplified in discrete time crystal model, Aubry-Andr\'e model, and quantum east model. Our method does not require any prior knowledge and exhibits effectiveness even in imperfect, disordered, and noisy situations that are challenging for human scientists. Successful classification of dynamic phases in many-body systems holds the potential to enable crucial applications, including identification of tsunamis, earthquakes, catastrophes and future trends in finance.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced ergodic-nonergodic transitions in finite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has observed the occurrence of pseudo-mobility edge (ME) within a modulated mosaic model incorporating the Wannier-Stark potential. This pseudo-ME, which signifies the critical energy that distinguishes between ergodic and weakly ergodic, or weakly ergodic and nonergodic states, is a crucial concept in comprehending the transport and localization phenomena in Wannier-Stark systems. Here we investigate the influence of dissipation on a finite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattice that features such pseudo-MEs by computing the steady state density matrix. Our findings indicate that particular dissipation can steer the system into specific states, regardless of its initial state, predominantly characterized by either ergodic or nonergodic states. This suggests that dissipation can be harnessed as a novel method for inducing transitions between these states and manipulating particle localization behaviors in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin chirality in electron gases is mandated by symmetry to be nonzero whenever time reversal symmetry (TRS) is broken. In metals, both normal and superconducting, spin chirality is generated by orbital currents present in the ground state as a result of TRS breaking. Nonzero chirality is found to emerge in the absence of any spin-dependent interactions, even when the ground state remains spin-unpolarized. We present a diagrammatic derivation of the chirality effect and illustrate its generality for problems such as valley magnetism and topological superconductivity. Spin chirality results in a chiral three-spin RKKY interaction between localized spins coupled to carriers by s-d interaction, an effect that can be detected by local probes such as spin-sensitive STM. In systems where detecting TRS breaking by macroscopic measurements is challenging, such as topological superconductors, local detection of spin chirality can serve as a reliable diagnostic of broken time reversal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: The ultrafast conversion of coherent excitons into incoherent excitons, as well as the subsequent exciton diffusion and thermalization, are central topics in current scientific research due to their relevance in optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Current approaches to the exciton dynamics rely on {\em model} Hamiltonians that depend on already screened electron-electron and electron-phonon couplings. In this work, we subject the state-of-the-art methods to scrutiny using the {\em ab initio} Hamiltonian for electrons and phonons. We offer a rigorous and intuitive proof demonstrating that the exciton dynamics governed by model Hamiltonians is affected by an overscreening of the electron-phonon interaction. The introduction of an auxiliary exciton species, termed the irreducible exciton, enables us to formulate a theory free from overscreening and derive the excitonic Bloch equations. These equations describe the time-evolution of coherent, irreducible, and incoherent excitons during and after the optical excitation. They are applicable beyond the linear regime, and predict that the total number of excitons is preserved when the external fields are switched off.</description>

      <title>Photonic "hourglass" design beyond the standard bulk model of phonon decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of mechanical vibrations on the performance of the photonic "hourglass" structure, which is predicted to emit single photons on-demand with near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability. Previous investigations neglected the impact of vibrational modes inherent to this quasi-1D geometry, relying instead on a three-dimensional bulk assumption for the phonon modes. However, it has been shown that phonon decoherence has a much stronger impact in 1D structures as compared with bulk media. Here, we surprisingly demonstrate the robustness of the photonic hourglass design, achieving close-to-unity indistinguishability even by incorporating a detailed description of the vibrational modes. We explain this unexpected result in terms of the large Purcell enhancement of the hourglass single-photon source, which eliminates the negative effect of phonons. Our findings highlight the key role of high-Q optical cavities in mitigating the detrimental effect of phonon decoherence, even for structures of reduced dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric phase control at domain-wall-like epitaxial oxide multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls are nanoscale objects that can be created, positioned, and erased on demand. They often embody functional properties that are distinct from the surrounding bulk material. Enhanced conductivity, for instance, is observed at charged ferroelectric domain walls. Regrettably, domain walls of this type are scarce because of the energetically unfavorable electrostatics. This hinders the current technological development of domain-wall nanoelectronics. Here we overcome this constraint by creating robust domain-wall-like objects in epitaxial oxide heterostructures. We design charged head-to-head (HH) and tail-to-tail (TT) junctions with two ferroelectric layers (BaTiO$_{3}$ and BiFeO$_{3}$) that have opposing out-of-plane polarization. To test domain-wall-like functionalities, we insert an ultrathin ferromagnetic La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ layer into the junctions. The interfacial electron or hole accumulation at the interfaces, set by the HH and TT polarization configurations, respectively, controls the LSMO conductivity and magnetization. We thus propose that trilayers reminiscent of artificial domain walls provide magnetoelectric functionality and may constitute an important building block in the design of oxide-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Versatile Method of Engineering the Band Alignment and the Electron Wavefunction Hybridization of Hybrid Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of quantum technology, hybrid devices that combine superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due to the possibility of engineering structures that benefit from the integration of the properties of both materials. However, until now, none of the experiments have reported good control of band alignment at the interface, which determines the strength of S-Sm coupling and the proximitized superconducting gap. Here, we fabricate hybrid devices in a generic way with argon milling to modify the interface while maintaining its high quality. First, after the milling the atomically connected S-Sm interfaces appear, resulting in a large induced gap, as well as the ballistic transport revealed by the multiple Andreev reflections and quantized above-gap conductance plateaus. Second, by comparing transport measurement with Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) calculations, we demonstrate that argon milling is capable of varying the band bending strength in the semiconducting wire as the electrons tend to accumulate on the etched surface for longer milling time. Finally, we perform nonlocal measurements on advanced devices to demonstrate the coexistence and tunability of crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and elastic co-tunneling (ECT) -- key ingredients for building the prototype setup for realization of Kitaev chain and quantum entanglement probing. Such a versatile method, compatible with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well-controlled modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid-state systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the classical dynamics influence the localization behaviour of Majorana wavefunctions in Majorana billiards. By using a connection between Majorana wavefunctions and eigenfunctions of a normal state Hamiltonian, we show that Majorana wavefunctions in both p-wave and s-wave topological superconductors inherit the properties of the underlying normal state eigenfunctions. As an example, we demonstrate that Majorana wavefunctions in topological superconductors with chaotic shapes feature quantum scarring. Furthermore, we show a way to manipulate a localized Majorana wavefunction by altering the underlying classical dynamics using a local potential away from the localization region. Finally, in the presence of chiral symmetry breaking, we find that the Majorana wavefunction in convex-shaped Majorana billiards exhibits caustics formation, reminiscent of a normal state system with magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of measured dependencies of strength of spin-orbit interaction and anisotropy field on current density in FeCoB nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticles-mediated thermal diode effect in Weyl Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically show quasiparticles-driven thermal diode effect (TDE) in an inversion symmetry-broken (ISB) Weyl superconductor (WSC)-Weyl semimetal (WSM)-WSC Josephson junction. A Zeeman field perpendicular to the WSM region of the thermally-biased Weyl Josephson junction (WJJ) induces an asymmetry between the forward and reverse thermal currents, which is responsible for the TDE. Most interestingly, we show that the sign and magnitude of the thermal diode rectification coefficient is highly tunable by the superconducting phase difference and external Zeeman field, and also strongly depends on the junction length. The tunability of the rectification, particularly, the sign changing behavior associated with higher rectification enhances the potential of our WJJ thermal diode to use as functional switching components in thermal devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchange-coupled interfaces are pivotal in exploiting two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism. Due to the extraordinary correlations among charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, layered magnetic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) bode well for exotic topological phenomena. Here we report the realization of wafer-scale Cr2Te3 down to monolayer (ML) on insulating SrTiO3(111) and/or Al2O3(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Robust ferromagnetism persists in the 2D limit. In particular, the Curie temperature TC of 2 ML Cr2Te3 increases from 100 K to ~ 120 K when proximitized to topological insulator (TI) (Bi,Sb)2Te3, with substantially boosted magnetization as observed via polarized neutron reflectometry. Our experiments and theory strongly indicate that the Bloembergen-Rowland interaction is likely universal underlying TC enhancement in TI-coupled magnetic heterostructures. The topological-surface-enhanced magnetism in 2D TMC enables further exchange coupling physics and quantu</description>

      <title>Selective-Area Epitaxy of Bulk-Insulating (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films and Nanowires by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

      <title>Constraints on real space representations of Chern bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Chern band is characterized by a Wannier obstruction indicating the absence of a basis of complete, orthogonal, and exponentially-localized states. Here, we study the properties of real space bases of a Chern band obtained by relaxing either exponential localization or orthogonality and completeness. This yields two distinct real space representations of a band with Chern number $C$: (i) a basis of complete orthogonal Wannier states which decay as power-law and (ii) a basis of exponentially-localized overcomplete non-orthogonal coherent states. For (i), we show that the power-law tail only depends on the Chern number and provide an explicit gauge choice leading to the universal asymptotic $w({\boldsymbol r}) \approx \frac{C e^{-i C \varphi_{\boldsymbol r}}}{2\pi |{\boldsymbol r}|^2}$ up to a normalized Bloch-periodic spinor. For (ii), we prove a rigorous lower bound on the spatial spread that can always be saturated for ideal bands. We provide an explicit construction of the maximally localized coherent state by mapping the problem to a dual Landau level problem where the Berry curvature and trace of the quantum metric take the roles of an effective magnetic field and scalar potential, respectively. Our coherent state result rigorously bounds the spatial spread of any localized state constructed as a linear superposition of wavefunctions within the Chern band. Remarkably, we find that such bound does not generically scale with the Chern number and provide an explicit example of an exponentially localized state in a Chern $C$ band whose size does not increase with $|C|$. Our results show that band topology can be encoded in a real space description and set the stage for a systematic study of interaction effects in topological bands in real space.</description>

      <title>Investigating Metal Dopants for Lowering the Contact Resistance of Top Gold Contacted Monolayer MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface properties between gold (Au) contacts and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are critical for optimizing the performance of semiconductor devices. This study investigates the impact of metal dopants (D) on the transport properties of MoS2 devices with top Au contacts, aiming to reduce contact resistance and enhance device performance. Using density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)- based first-principles calculations, we examine the structural, electronic, and quantum transport properties of Au-contacted, metal-doped MoS2. Our results indicate that Cd, Re, and Ru dopants significantly improve the structural stability and electronic properties of MoS2. Specifically, formation energy calculations show that Cd and Re are stable at hollow sites, while Ru prefers bond sites. Remarkably, Au-Ru-MoS2-based device exhibits tunnel resistance (RT ) up to 4.82 ohm-um. Furthermore, a dual-gated Au-Ru-MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) demonstrates an impressive Ion/Ioff ratio of 10^8 at Vgs of 2 V, highlighting its potential for nano-switching applications.</description>
