      <title>Exact solitary wave solutions for a coupled gKdV-Schrodinger system by a new ODE reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method is developed for finding exact solitary wave solutions of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with p-power nonlinearity coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation arising in many different physical applications. This method yields 22 solution families, with p=1,2,3,4. No solutions for p&gt;1 were known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families contain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in recent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves. All of the new solution families have interesting features, including bright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude and a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is fully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling wave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial solutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to other coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE systems of generalized H\'enon-Heiles form.</description>

      <title>A straightforward construction of $\Bbb Z$-graded Lie algebras of full-fledged nonlocal symmetries via recursion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the reduced quasi-classical self-dual Yang-Mills equation (rYME) and two recently found (Jahnov\'{a} and Voj\v{c}\'{a}k, 2024) invertible recursion operators $\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\mathcal{R}^m$ for its full-fledged (in a given differential covering) nonlocal symmetries. We introduce a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading on the Lie algebra $\mathrm{sym}_{\mathcal{L}}^{\tau^W} (\mathcal E)$ of all nonlocal Laurent polynomial symmetries of the rYME and prove that both the operators $\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\mathcal{R}^m$ are $\mathbb{Z}$-graded automorphisms of the underlying vector space on the set $\mathrm{sym}_{\mathcal{L}}^{\tau^W} (\mathcal E)$. This inter alia implies that all its vector subspaces formed by all homogeneous elements of a given fixed degree (i.e. a weight in the context below) are mutually isomorphic, and thus each of them can be uniquely reconstructed from the vector space of all homogeneous symmetries of the zero degree. To the best of our knowledge, such a result is unparalleled in the current body of literature. The obtained results are used for the construction of a Lie subalgebra $V$ of $\mathrm{sym}_{\mathcal{L}}^{\tau^W} (\mathcal E)$ which contains all known to us nonlocal Laurent polynomial symmetries of the rYME. The Lie algebra $V$ is subsequently described as the linear span of the orbits of a set of selected zero-weight symmetries - we refer to them as to the seed generators of $V$. Further, we study the hierarchies of symmetries related to the seed generators under the action of the group of recursion operators generated by $\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\mathcal{R}^m$. Finally, the linear dependence/independence of the (sub)set of generators of $V$ is discussed.</description>

      <title>Existence of Discrete Traveling Waves in Fully Coupled Network of Mackey-Glass Relay Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully coupled network of Mackey-Glass generators is considered. Each generator is described by a limit equation for the Mackey-Glass equation. The right parts are represented by a relay function obtained when the exponent in the denominator of the nonlinearity tends to infinity. Discrete traveling waves are sought in the system. These modes are such that all components are represented by the same periodic function with successive (multiple of the same value) shifts. Moreover, this periodic function has the smallest number of switchings, that is, points at which the right-hand sides change the analytical form. It is shown that discrete traveling waves coexist in the system. Moreover, their number is equal to the factorial of the number of generators.</description>

      <title>Pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network solving the integrable nonlinear lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional discrete learning methods involve discretizing continuous equations using difference schemes, necessitating considerations of stability and convergence. Integrable nonlinear lattice equations possess a profound mathematical structure that enables them to revert to continuous integrable equations in the continuous limit, particularly retaining integrable properties such as conservation laws, Hamiltonian structure, and multiple soliton solutions. The pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network (PG-PhyCRNet) is proposed to investigate the localized wave solutions of integrable lattice equations, which significantly enhances the model's extrapolation capability to lattice points beyond the temporal domain. We conduct a comparative analysis of PG-PhyCRNet with and without pseudo grid by investigating the multi-soliton solutions and rational solitons of the Toda lattice and self-dual network equation. The results indicate that the PG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's extrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms and high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its effect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed through repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.</description>

      <title>Two-parameter quantum groups and $R$-matrices: classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [M.Ge, Y.Wu, K.Xue, "Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization", Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the tensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter quantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [M.Jimbo, "Quantum R matrix for the generalized Toda system", Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), no. 4, 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces from conformal transformations and some of its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of two classes of Lie-Hamilton systems on the Euclidean plane to two-dimensional curved spaces, leading to novel Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian spaces (flat $2$-torus, product of hyperbolic lines, sphere and hyperbolic plane), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as to semi-Riemannian spaces (Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes). The vector fields, Hamiltonian functions, symplectic form and constants of the motion of the Euclidean classes are recovered by a contraction process. The construction is based on the structure of certain subalgebras of the so-called conformal algebras of the two-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces. These curved Lie-Hamilton classes allow us to generalize naturally the Riccati, Kummer-Schwarz and Ermakov equations on the Euclidean plane to curved spaces, covering both the Riemannian and Lorentzian possibilities, and where the curvature can be considered as an integrable deformation parameter of the initial Euclidean system.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>
