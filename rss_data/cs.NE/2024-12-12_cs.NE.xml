      <title>Evolution of Thought: Diverse and High-Quality Reasoning via Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks, the diversity and quality of reasoning paths become crucial factors affecting their performance. Although current methods aim to enhance reasoning quality through path expansion, they often neglect the diversity of reasoning paths and effective information sharing, leading to local optima and inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Evolution of Thought (EoT), a multi-objective framework designed to improve reasoning by fostering both high-quality and diverse reasoning paths. Specifically, we introduce the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II for multi-objective optimization, utilizing crossover and mutation operators to promote greater diversity in reasoning solutions. Additionally, we propose a Condensation-Aggregation mechanism to cluster and eliminate redundant paths, facilitate improved information sharing among parent nodes, and ultimately enhance both the efficiency and quality of the reasoning process. Validation experiments on various vision-language and language reasoning tasks demonstrate that EoT achieves superior reasoning performance and efficiency compared to other competitive baselines. Our study provides a novel perspective on the design of heuristic reasoning frameworks for MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Bayesian Optimization Approach for Capacity Planning of the Distributed Energy Resources in an Active Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) leads to complex and uncertain operation scenarios, resulting in significant deviations and risks for the ADN operation. In this study, a collaborative capacity planning of the distributed energy resources in an ADN is proposed to enhance the RES accommodation capability. The variability of RESs, characteristics of adjustable demand response resources, ADN bi-directional power flow, and security operation limitations are considered in the proposed model. To address the noise term caused by the inevitable deviation between the operation simulation and real-world environments, an improved noise-aware Bayesian optimization algorithm with the probabilistic surrogate model is proposed to overcome the interference from the environmental noise and sample-efficiently optimize the capacity planning model under noisy circumstances. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed approach in coping with environmental noise and achieving lower annual cost and higher computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Different Fault Injection Abstractions on the Assessment of DNN SW Hardening Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of Neural Networks has gained significant attention, prompting efforts to develop SW-based hardening techniques for safety-critical scenarios. However, evaluating hardening techniques using application-level fault injection (FI) strategies, which are commonly hardware-agnostic, may yield misleading results. This study for the first time compares two FI approaches (at the application level (APP) and instruction level (ISA)) to evaluate deep neural network SW hardening strategies. Results show that injecting permanent faults at ISA (a more detailed abstraction level than APP) changes completely the ranking of SW hardening techniques, in terms of both reliability and accuracy. These results highlight the relevance of using an adequate analysis abstraction for evaluating such techniques.</description>

      <title>E2HQV: High-Quality Video Generation from Event Camera via Theory-Inspired Model-Aided Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bio-inspired event cameras or dynamic vision sensors are capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes (called event-streams) in high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. However, the non-structural spatial-temporal event-streams make it challenging for providing intuitive visualization with rich semantic information for human vision. It calls for events-to-video (E2V) solutions which take event-streams as input and generate high quality video frames for intuitive visualization. However, current solutions are predominantly data-driven without considering the prior knowledge of the underlying statistics relating event-streams and video frames. It highly relies on the non-linearity and generalization capability of the deep neural networks, thus, is struggling on reconstructing detailed textures when the scenes are complex. In this work, we propose \textbf{E2HQV}, a novel E2V paradigm designed to produce high-quality video frames from events. This approach leverages a model-aided deep learning framework, underpinned by a theory-inspired E2V model, which is meticulously derived from the fundamental imaging principles of event cameras. To deal with the issue of state-reset in the recurrent components of E2HQV, we also design a temporal shift embedding module to further improve the quality of the video frames. Comprehensive evaluations on the real world event camera datasets validate our approach, with E2HQV, notably outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., surpassing the second best by over 40\% for some evaluation metrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field of data analysis grows rapidly due to the large amounts of data being generated, effective data classification has become increasingly important. This paper introduces the RUle Mutation Classifier (RUMC), which represents a significant improvement over the Rule Aggregation ClassifiER (RACER). RUMC uses innovative rule mutation techniques based on evolutionary methods to improve classification accuracy. In tests with forty datasets from OpenML and the UCI Machine Learning Repository, RUMC consistently outperformed twenty other well-known classifiers, demonstrating its ability to uncover valuable insights from complex data.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision in Bolted Joint Design: A Preliminary Machine Learning-Based Parameter Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bolted joints are critical in engineering for maintaining structural integrity and reliability. Accurate prediction of parameters influencing their function and behavior is essential for optimal performance. Traditional methods often fail to capture the non-linear behavior of bolted joints or require significant computational resources, limiting accuracy and efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by combining empirical data with a feed-forward neural network to predict load capacity and friction coefficients. Leveraging experimental data and systematic preprocessing, the model effectively captures nonlinear relationships, including rescaling output variables to address scale discrepancies, achieving 95.24% predictive accuracy. While limited dataset size and diversity restrict generalizability, the findings demonstrate the potential of neural networks as a reliable, efficient alternative for bolted joint design. Future work will focus on expanding datasets and exploring hybrid modeling techniques to enhance applicability.</description>

      <title>A Robust Clustering Framework Combining Minimum Description Length and Genetic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are fundamental in data analysis, enabling the organization of data into meaningful groups. However, individual clustering methods often face limitations and biases, making it challenging to develop a universal solution for diverse datasets. To address this, we propose a novel clustering framework that combines the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with a genetic optimization algorithm. This approach begins with an ensemble clustering solution as a baseline, which is refined using MDL-based evaluation functions and optimized with a genetic algorithm. By leveraging the MDL principle, the method adapts to the intrinsic properties of datasets, minimizing dependence on input clusters and ensuring a data-driven process. The proposed method was evaluated on thirteen benchmark datasets using four validation metrics: accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), Fisher score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Results show that the method consistently outperforms traditional clustering algorithms, achieving higher accuracy, greater stability, and reduced biases. Its adaptability makes it a reliable tool for clustering complex and varied datasets. This study demonstrates the potential of combining MDL and genetic optimization to create a robust and versatile clustering framework, advancing the field of data analysis and offering a scalable solution for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</description>
