      <title>A Phase-field Model for Apoptotic Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of programmed cell death, namely apoptosis, is a natural mechanism that regulates healthy tissue, multicellular structures, and homeostasis. An improved understanding of apoptosis can significantly enhance our knowledge of biological processes and systems. For instance, pathogens can manipulate the apoptotic process to either evade immune detection or to facilitate their spread. Furthermore of particular clinical interest is the ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis, hence allowing them to survive and proliferate uncontrollably. Thus, in this work, we propose a phase-field model for simulating cellular apoptosis induced by a cytotoxin, including deriving the configurational mechanics underlying such phenomena. Along with exploring varying conditions needed to initiate or reduce apoptosis, this can serve as a starting point for computational therapeutic testing. To showcase model capabilities, we present simulations exhibiting different types of cellular dynamics produced when varying the mechanisms underlying apoptosis. The model is subsequently applied to probe different morphological transitions, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, cavity formation and fragmentation. Lastly, we compare the characteristics observed in our simulations to electron microscopy images, providing additional support for the model.</description>
