      <title>Prospects for the determination of fundamental constants with beyond-state-of-the-art uncertainty using molecular hydrogen ion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level $v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass ratios two orders smaller than CODATA 2018, and without using muonic hydrogen data. For the Rydberg constant and the charge radii, improvements by factors of 4 to 11 are projected.</description>

      <title>Enhancing sensitivity of atomic microwave receiver combining laser arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom,which exhibits a strong response to weak electric(E) fields,is regarded as a promising atomic receiver to surpass sensitivity of conventional receivers. However, its sensitivity is strongly limited by the noise coming from both classical and quantum levels and how to enhance it significantly remains challenging. Here we experimentally prove that the sensitivity of Rydberg atomic receiver can be increased to 23 nV/cm/Hz1/2 by combining laser arrays. Theoretically, we demonstrate that multiple beams illuminating on a PD perform better than multiple PDs for laser arrays.In our experiment,10 dB SNR enhancement is achieved by utilizing 2 * 2 probe beam arrays, compared to the performance of a laser beam,and it can be enhanced further just by adding a resonator. The results could offer an avenue for the design and optimization of ultrahigh-sensitivity Rydberg atomic receivers and promote applications in cosmology, meteorology, communication, and microwave quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold deeply-bound molecules via multi-state chainwise coincident pulses technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and, it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Floquet Engineering for Large Scale Atom Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective control of atomic coherence with cold atoms has made atom interferometry an essential tool for quantum sensors and precision measurements. The performance of these interferometers is closely related to the operation of large wave packet separations. We present here a novel approach for atomic beam splitters based on the stroboscopic stabilization of quantum states in an accelerated optical lattice. The corresponding Floquet state is generated by optimal control protocols. In this way, we demonstrate an unprecedented Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) interferometer, with a momentum separation of 600 photon recoils ($600\hbar k$) between its two arms. Each LMT beam splitter is realized in a remarkably short time (2 ms) and is highly robust against the initial velocity dispersion of the wave packet and lattice depth fluctuations. Our study shows that Floquet engineering is a promising tool for exploring new frontiers in quantum physics at large scales, with applications in quantum sensing and testing fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Determination of principal axes orientation in an ion trap using matter-wave interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the control mechanism of trap frequencies and determine the orientation of ion trap principal axes. The application of DC voltage to the ground electrodes, commonly employed to finely tune trap frequencies in ion traps, leads to the rotation of the trap principal axes. Analyzing the ion matter-wave interference signal enables us to determine the directions of the trap principal axes. Both the experiments and simulations reveal an avoided-crossing behavior resulting from the coupling between the trap radial axes. Additionally, simulations indicate that symmetric trap structures lack this coupling, suggesting that trap structure asymmetry causes coupling between the axes. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into ion traps for diverse applications in quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>$^{171}$Yb$^+$ optical clock with $2.2\times 10^{-18}$ systematic uncertainty and absolute frequency measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A full evaluation of the uncertainty budget for the ytterbium ion optical clock at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) was performed on the electric octupole (E3) $^2\mathrm{S}_{1/2}\,\rightarrow\, ^2\mathrm{F}_{7/2}$ transition. The total systematic frequency shift was measured with a fractional standard systematic uncertainty of $2.2\times 10^{-18}$. Furthermore, the absolute frequency of the E3 transition of the $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ion was measured between 2019 and 2023 via a link to International Atomic Time (TAI) and against the local caesium fountain NPL-CsF2. The absolute frequencies were measured with fractional standard uncertainties between $3.7 \times 10^{-16}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-15}$, and all were in agreement with the 2021 BIPM recommended frequency.</description>

      <title>Space-time quasicrystals in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An autoresonant approach for exciting space-time quasicrystals in Bose-Einstein condensates is proposed by employing two-component chirped frequency parametric driving or modulation of the interaction strength within Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A weakly nonlinear theory of the process is developed using Whitham's averaged variational principle yielding reduction to a two-degrees-of-freedom dynamical system in action-angle variables. Additionally, the theory also delineates permissible driving parameters and establishes thresholds on the driving amplitudes required for autoresonant excitation.</description>

      <title>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Optical Pumping in Cesium Atoms with a Radio-Frequency Field, Using Liouville Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical pumping is a technique for engineering atomic-sublevel population of desired atoms. We investigate the population evolution of Cesium atoms by employing Liouville equation. For this purpose, we apply a circularly polarized light at a frequency suitable for electronic transition from ground states to excited states and calculate the relaxation rate, repopulation, and population evolution of the Cesium Zeeman sublevels. For engineering the sublevel population after optical pumping, we employ a radiofrequency (RF) field and consider the effect of RF field in Liouville equation. With this approach, we are able to prepare desired distribution of the population in the atomic sublevels with high efficiency, which can be employed in different optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Hyperradiance, photon blockade and concurrence in a pair of qubits inside a driven cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the radiance properties of a pair of qubits inside a single-mode cavity driven by a two-photon drive. Our results show that, when the two qubits are strongly coupled to the cavity field, the collective radiation emitted from the qubits exhibits hyperradiance which can be detected as a signature of two qubit entanglement in the weak-driving regime. We quantify the entanglement in terms of concurrence. Additionally, we study the radiance behaviour in the presence of an intracavity Kerr-nonlinear medium that leads to two-photon blockade. Our results suggest that this system with nonlinearity may act as a quadrature-squeezed and hyperradiant two-photon source.</description>

      <title>Pushing single atoms near an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical scattering force is used to reduce the loading time of single atoms to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic transport with narrow velocity distribution. We also observe in real time that, when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our method can be employed to make atom-cavity experiments more efficient.</description>
