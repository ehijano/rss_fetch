      <title>Solvable Groups in which Every Real Element has Prime Power Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite solvable groups $G$ in which every real element has prime power order. We divide our examination into two parts: the case $\textbf{O}_2(G)&gt;1$ and the case $\textbf{O}_2(G)=1$. Specifically we proved that if $\textbf{O}_2(G)&gt;1$ then $G$ is a $\{2,p\}$-group. Finally, by taking into consideration the examples presented in the analysis of the $\textbf{O}_2(G)=1$ case, we deduce some interesting and unexpected results about the connectedness of the real prime graph $\Gamma_{\mathbb{R}}(G)$. In particular, we found that there are groups such that $\Gamma_{\mathbb{R}}(G)$ has respectively 3 and 4 connected components.</description>

      <title>The finite basis problem for additively idempotent semirings of order four, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite basis problem for $4$-element additively idempotent semirings whose additive reducts have two minimal elements and one coatom. Up to isomorphism, there are $112$ such algebras. We show that $106$ of them are finitely based and the remaining ones are nonfinitely based.</description>

      <title>Bi-infinite Riordan matrices: a matricial approach to multiplication and composition of Laurent series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a bi-infinite matrix approach to the multiplication and composition of formal Laurent series. We generalize the concept of Riordan matrix to this bi-infinite context, obtaining matrices that are not necessarily lower triangular and are determined, not by a pair of formal power series, but by a pair of Laurent series. We extend the First Fundamental Theorem of Riordan Matrices to this setting, as well as the Toeplitz and Lagrange subgroups, that are subgroups of the classical Riordan group. Finally, as an illustrative example, we apply our approach to derive a classical combinatorial identity that cannot be proved using the techniques related to the classical Riordan group, showing that our generalization is not fruitless.</description>

      <title>A character theoretic formula for base size II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A base for a permutation group $G$ acting on a set $\Omega$ is a sequence $\mathcal{B}$ of points of $\Omega$ such that the pointwise stabiliser $G_{\mathcal{B}}$ is trivial. The base size of $G$ is the size of a smallest base for $G$. Extending the results of a recent paper of the author, we prove a 2013 conjecture of Fritzsche, K\"ulshammer, and Reiche. Moreover, we generalise this conjecture and derive an alternative character theoretic formula for the base size of a certain class of permutation groups. As a consequence of our work, a third formula for the base size of the symmetric group of degree $n$ acting on the subsets of $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Gap Absorption Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that unitary representations of simply connected, semisimple algebraic groups over local fields of characteristic zero obey a spectral gap absorption principle: that is, that spectral gap is preserved under tensor products. We do this by proving that the unitary dual of simple algebraic groups is filtered by the integrability parameter of matrix coefficients. This is a filtration of closed ideals that captures every closed subset of the dual that doesn't contain the trivial representation. In other words, we show that a representation has a spectral gap if and only if there exists some $p &lt; \infty$ such that its matrix coefficients are in $L^{p+\epsilon}(G)$ for every $\epsilon&gt;0$. Doing this, we continue the work of Bader and Sauer in this area and prove a conjecture they phrased. We also use this principle to give an affirmative solution to a conjecture raised by Bekka and Valette: the image of the restriction map from a semisimple group to a lattice is never dense in Fell topology.</description>

      <title>Additive diameters of group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the concept of additive diameters in the context of group representations, unifying various noncommutative Waring-type problems. Given a finite-dimensional representation $\rho \colon G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ and a subspace $U \leq V$ that generates $V$ as a $G$-module, we define the $G$-additive diameter of $V$ with respect to $U$ as the minimal number of translates of $U$ under the representation $\rho$ needed to cover $V$. We demonstrate that every irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{C})$ exhibits optimal additive diameters and establish sharp bounds for the conjugation representation of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{C})$ on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbf{C})$. Additionally, we investigate analogous notions for additive diameters in Lie representations. We provide applications to additive diameters with respect to images of equivariant algebraic morphisms, linking them to the corresponding $G$-additive diameters of images of their differentials.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique geometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and performance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic lattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds compared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in hyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing HQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for computing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given HQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this framework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of hyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as encoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices. This work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs in the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.</description>

      <title>Character degrees and local subgroups revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $q$ be different primes and let $G$ be a finite $q$-solvable group. We prove that $\mathrm{Irr}_{p'}(G)\subseteq \mathrm{Irr}_{q'}(G)$ if and only if $\mathbf{N}_G(P)\subseteq \mathbf{N}_G(Q)$ and $\mathbf{C}_{Q'}(P)=1$ for some $P\in\mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$ and $Q\in\mathrm{Syl}_q(G)$. Further, if $B$ is a $q$-block of $G$ and $p$ does not divide the degree of any character in $\mathrm{Irr}(B)$ then we prove that a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is normalized by a defect group of $B$. This removes the $p$-solvability condition of two theorems of G. Navarro and T. R. Wolf.</description>

      <title>On exterior powers of reflection representations, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a group endowed with a finite set $S$ of generators. A representation $(V,\rho)$ of $W$ is called a reflection representation of $(W,S)$ if $\rho(s)$ is a (generalized) reflection on $V$ for each generator $s \in S$. In this paper, we prove that for any irreducible reflection representation $V$, all the exterior powers $\bigwedge ^d V$, $d = 0, 1, \dots, \dim V$, are irreducible $W$-modules, and they are non-isomorphic to each other. This extends a theorem of R. Steinberg which is stated for Euclidean reflection groups. Moreover, we prove that the exterior powers (except for the 0th and the highest power) of two non-isomorphic reflection representations always give non-isomorphic $W$-modules. This allows us to construct numerous pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible representations for such groups, especially for Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Skew bracoids containing a skew brace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skew bracoids have been shown to have applications in Hopf-Galois theory. We show that a certain family of skew bracoids correspond bijectively with left cancellative semibraces. A consequence of this correspondence is that skew bracoids in this family can be used to obtain and study solutions of the set-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation; we study this process and the resulting solutions. We give numerous examples of skew bracoids satisfying our hypothesis, drawing upon a variety of constructions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Projection algebras and free projection- and idempotent-generated regular $*$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new family of semigroups - the free projection-generated regular $*$-semigroups - and initiate their systematic study. Such a semigroup $PG(P)$ is constructed from a projection algebra $P$, using the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups. The assignment $P\mapsto PG(P)$ is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that maps a regular $*$-semigroup $S$ to its projection algebra $P(S)$. In fact, the category of projection algebras is coreflective in the category of regular $*$-semigroups. The algebra $P(S)$ uniquely determines the biordered structure of the idempotents $E(S)$, up to isomorphism, and this leads to a category equivalence between projection algebras and regular $*$-biordered sets. As a consequence, $PG(P)$ can be viewed as a quotient of the classical free idempotent-generated (regular) semigroups $IG(E)$ and $RIG(E)$, where $E=E(PG(P))$; this is witnessed by a number of presentations in terms of generators and defining relations. The semigroup $PG(P)$ can also be interpreted topologically, through a natural link to the fundamental groupoid of a simplicial complex explicitly constructed from $P$. The theory is then illustrated on a number of examples. In one direction, the free construction applied to the projection algebras of adjacency semigroups yields a new family of graph-based path semigroups. In another, it turns out that, remarkably, the Temperley-Lieb monoid $TL_n$ is the free regular $*$-semigroup over its own projection algebra $P(TL_n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A surface group representation into a Lie group is called totally elliptic if every simple closed curve on the surface is mapped to an elliptic element of the target group. In this note, we characterize all totally elliptic surface group representations into $\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{C}$ by showing that they are either representations into a compact subgroup or Deroin--Tholozan representations.</description>

      <title>Sets preserved by a large subgroup of the special linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a subset of the affine plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We bound the size of the subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that preserves $E$. As a consequence, we show that if $E$ has size $\ll q^\alpha$ and is preserved by $\gg q^\beta$ elements of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ with $\beta\geq 3\alpha/2$, then $E$ is contained in a line. This result is sharp in general, and will be proved by using combinatorial arguments and applying a point-line incidence bound in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$ due to Mockenhaupt and Tao (2004).</description>
