      <title>Proof of the Complete Presence of a Modulo 4 Bias for the Semiprimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dummit, Granville and Kisilevsky have recently shown that the proportion of semiprimes (products of two primes) not exceeding a given $x$, whose factors are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, is more than a quarter when $x$ is sufficiently large. They have also conjectured that this holds from the very beginning, that is, for all $x \geq 9$. We give a proof for $x\geq 10^{21}$ via an explicit approach based on their work. Together with their data for the remaining $x$, this results in a full proof of the conjecture. Our method consists of techniques from Analytic Number Theory, such as Partial Summation and cancellations with sums over primes with different remainders. We also rely on classical estimates for prime counting functions, as well as on very recent explicit improvements by Bennet, Martin, O'Bryant and Rechnitzer, which have wide applications in essentially any setting involving estimations of sums over primes.</description>

      <title>Semi-stable and splitting models for unitary Shimura varieties over ramified places. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Shimura varieties associated to a unitary group of signature $(n-1, 1)$. For these varieties, we construct $p$-adic integral models over odd primes $p$ which ramify in the imaginary quadratic field with level subgroup at $p$ given by the stabilizer of a vertex lattice in the hermitian space. Our models are given by a variation of the construction of the splitting models of Pappas-Rapoport and they have a simple moduli theoretic description. By an explicit calculation, we show that these splitting models are normal, flat, Cohen-Macaulay and with reduced special fiber. In fact, they have relatively simple singularities: we show that a single blow-up along a smooth codimension one subvariety of the special fiber produces a semi-stable model. This also implies the existence of semi-stable models of the corresponding Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>On $\beta$-adic expansions of powers of algebraic integer omitting a digit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha, \beta$ be two relatively prime algebraic integers in a number field $K$ and $N$ be a positive integer. We show that the number of $n\in\{1,2,\dots,N\}$ such that the $\beta$-adic expansion of $\alpha^n$ omits a given digit is less than $C_1 N^{\sigma(\beta)}$, where $\sigma(\beta):=\frac{\log(|N(\beta)|-1)}{\log|N(\beta)|}$ and $C_1$ is an absolute constant, if all prime ideal factors of $\beta$ are unramified and their norms are integer primes.</description>

      <title>Algebraic integers with continued fraction expansions containing palindromes and square roots with prescribed periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exist infinitely many algebraic integers with continued fraction expansion of the kind $[a_0, \overline{a_1, \ldots, a_n, s}]$ where $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is a palindrome and $s \in \mathbb N_{\geq1}$, characterizing all the algebraic integers with such expansions. We also provide an explicit method for finding $s$ and determining the corresponding algebraic integer. Moreover, we deal with the particular case $(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = (m, \ldots, m)$ describing the corresponding algebraic integers in terms of Fibonacci polynomials. We exploit these results for obtaining expansions of square roots of integers with prescribed periods and we also write explicitly the fundamental solutions of the corresponding Pell's equations.</description>

      <title>Adic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes are based on the second course in a series of lectures at the Spring school "Non-archimedean geometry and Eigenvarieties" in March 2023 in Heidelberg. The objective of the first three courses was to give an introduction to the theory of adic spaces. Building up on the theory of Huber pairs presented in John Bergdall's lecture we explain the construction of adic spaces. We study some important classes of adic spaces such as rigid analytic spaces and formal schemes and show the connections between them. In the course of the lecture we will illustrate the respective concepts with the fundamental examples of the open and closed disc and the affine line.</description>

      <title>Integer partitions detect the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that integer partitions, the fundamental building blocks in additive number theory, detect prime numbers in an unexpected way. Answering a question of Schneider, we show that the primes are the solutions to special equations in partition functions. For example, an integer $n\geq 2$ is prime if and only if
  $$
  (3n^3 - 13n^2 + 18n - 8)M_1(n) + (12n^2 - 120n + 212)M_2(n) -960M_3(n) = 0,
  $$
  where the $M_a(n)$ are MacMahon's well-studied partition functions. More generally, for "MacMahonesque" partition functions $M_{\vec{a}}(n),$ we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients, such as 
  $$
  80M_{(1,1,1)}(n)-12M_{(2,0,1)}(n)+12M_{(2,1,0)}(n)+\dots-12M_{(1,3)}(n)-39M_{(3,1)}(n)=0.

      <title>Some uniform effective results on Andr\'{e}--Oort for sums of powers in $\mathbb{C}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an Andr\'e--Oort-type result for a family of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that is both uniform and effective. Let $K_*$ denote the single exceptional imaginary quadratic field which occurs in the Siegel--Tatuzawa lower bound for the class number. We prove that, for $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$, there exists an effective constant $c(m, n)&gt;0$ with the following property: if pairwise distinct singular moduli $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with respective discriminants $\Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_n$ are such that $a_1 x_1^m + \ldots + a_n x_n^m \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ and $\# \{ \Delta_i : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_i}) = K_*\} \leq 1$, then $\max_i \lvert \Delta_i \rvert \leq c(m, n)$. In addition, we prove an unconditional and completely explicit version of this result when $(m, n) = (1, 3)$ and thereby determine all the triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of singular moduli such that $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 \in \mathbb{Q}$ for some $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$.</description>

      <title>The Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating Conjecture on Mesoscopic Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive precise upper bounds for the maximum of the Riemann zeta function on short intervals on the critical line, showing for any $\theta\in(-1,0]$, the set of $t\in [T,2T]$ for which $$\max_{|h|\leq \log^\theta T}|\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2}+it+ih)|&gt;\exp\bigg({y+\sqrt{(\log\log T)|\theta|/2}\cdot {S}}\bigg)\frac{(\log T)^{(1+\theta)}}{(\log\log T)^{3/4}}$$ is bounded above by $Cy\exp({-2y-y^2/((1+\theta)\log\log T)})$ (where $S$ is a random variable that is approximately a standard Gaussian as $T$ tends to infinity). This settles a strong form of a conjecture of Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating in mesoscopic intervals which was only known in the leading order. Using similar techniques, we also derive upper bounds for the second moment of the zeta function on such intervals. Conditioning on the value of $S$, we show that for all $t\in[T,2T]$ outside a set of order $o(T)$, $$\frac{1}{\log^\theta T}\int_{|h|\in \log^\theta T} |\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2}+it+ih)|^2\mathrm{d}h \ll e^{2S}\cdot \left(\frac{(\log T)^{(1+\theta)}}{\sqrt{\log\log T}}\right).$$ This proves a weak form of another conjecture of Fyodorov-Keating and generalizes a result of Harper, which is recovered at $\theta = 0$ (in which case $S$ is defined to be zero). Our main tool is an adaptation of the recursive scheme introduced by one of the authors, Bourgade and Radziwi{\l}{\l} to mesoscopic intervals.</description>

      <title>Measures and Charges on the Places of $\bar{\mathbb Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work of the author established dual representation theorems for certain vector spaces that arise in an important article of Allcock and Vaaler. These results constructed an object called a consistent map which acts like a measure on the set of places of $\bar{\mathbb Q}$, but is not a Borel measure on this space. We describe the appropriate ring of sets $\mathcal R$ for which every consistent map arises from a measure on $\mathcal R$. We further obtain the conditions under which a consistent map may be extended to a measure on the smallest algebra containing $\mathcal R$.</description>

      <title>Forms in prime variables and differing degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_1,\ldots,F_R$ be homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients in $n$ variables with differing degrees. Write $\boldsymbol{F}=(F_1,\ldots,F_R)$ with $D$ being the maximal degree. Suppose that $\boldsymbol{F}$ is a nonsingular system and $n\ge D^2 4^{D+6}R^5$. We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of prime solutions to $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{0}$, whose main term is positive if (i) $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{0}$ has a nonsingular solution over the $p$-adic units $\mathbb{U}_p$ for all primes $p$, and (ii) $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{0}$ has a nonsingular solution in the open cube $(0,1)^n$. This can be viewed as a smooth local-global principle for $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{0}$ with differing degrees. It follows that, under (i) and (ii), the set of prime solutions to $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{0}$ is Zariski dense in the set of its solutions.</description>

      <title>How often does a cubic hypersurface have a rational point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cubic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the vanishing locus of a cubic form $f$ in $n+1$ variables. It is conjectured that when $n \geq 4$, such cubic hypersurfaces satisfy the Hasse principle. This is now known to hold on average due to recent work of Browning, Le Boudec, and Sawin. Using this result, we determine the proportion of cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$, ordered by the height of $f$, with a rational point for $n \geq 4$ explicitly as a product over primes $p$ of rational functions in $p$. In particular, this proportion is equal to 1 for cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$ for $n \geq 9$; for $100\%$ of cubic hypersurfaces, this recovers a celebrated result of Heath-Brown that non-singular cubic forms in at least 10 variables have rational zeros. In the $n=3$ case, we give a precise conjecture for the proportion of cubic surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with a rational point.</description>

      <title>A Specialisation Theorem for Lang-N\'eron Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for a polarised smooth projective variety $B \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension $\geq 2$ over an infinite field $k$ and an abelian variety $A$ over the function field of $B$, there exists a dense Zariski open set of smooth geometrically connected hyperplane sections $h$ of $B$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $h$ and the specialisation homomorphism of Lang-N\'eron groups at $h$ has a finite kernel. This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of the first author, which is used to deduce a negative definiteness result on his refined height pairing. This also sheds a new light on N\'eron's specialisation theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the difference analogue of Stothers-Mason theorem for entire functions of order less than 1, which can be seen as difference $abc$ theorem for entire functions with slow growth. We also obtain the difference analogue of truncated version of Nevanlinna second main theorem which reveals that a non-periodic meromorphic function with period one of finite order cannot have too many points with long height in the complex plane. Both theorems depend on new definitions of height of shifting poles and shifting zeros of a given meromorphic function in a domain.</description>

Abstract: We derive formulae for Gram matrices arising in the Nyman--Beurling reformulation of the Riemann hypothesis. The development naturally leads upon series of the form $S(x) = \sum_{n\ge 1} R(nx)$ and their reciprocity relations. We give integral representations of these series; and we present decompositions of the quadratic forms associated with the Gram matrices along with a discussion of the components' properties.</description>

      <title>Consistent maps and their associated dual representation theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 2009 article of Allcock and Vaaler examined the vector space $\mathcal G := \overline{\mathbb Q}^\times/\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times_{\mathrm{tors}}$ over $\mathbb Q$, describing its completion with respect to the Weil height as a certain $L^1$ space. By involving an object called a consistent map, the author began efforts to establish representation theorems for the duals of spaces related to $\mathcal G$. Specifically, we provided representation theorems for the algebraic and continuous duals of $\overline{\mathbb Q}^\times/{\overline{\mathbb Z}}^\times$. We explore further applications of consistent maps to provide representation theorems for duals of other spaces arising in the work of Allcock and Vaaler. In particular, we establish a connection between consistent maps and locally constant functions on the space of places of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. We further apply our new results to recover, as a corollary, a main theorem of our previous work.</description>

      <title>Characterising local fields of positive characteristic by Galois theory and the Brauer group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that each local field $\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ is characterised up to isomorphism within the class of all fields of imperfect exponent at most $1$ by (certain small quotients of) its absolute Galois group together with natural axioms concerning the $p$-torsion of its Brauer group. This complements previous work by Efrat-Fesenko, who analysed fields whose absolute Galois group is isomorphic to that of a local field of characteristic $p$.</description>

      <title>On sporadic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove the last remaining case of the original 15 two-term supercongruence conjectures for sporadic sequences. The proof utilizes a new representation for this sequence (due to Gorodetsky) as the constant term of powers of a Laurent polynomial.</description>

      <title>Restricted sumsets in $\mathbb{Z}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\geqslant 3$ and let $A=\{0=a_{0}&lt;a_{1}&lt;\cdots&lt;a_{k-1}\}$ with $\gcd(A)=1$. Let $2^{\wedge}A$ denote the set of all sums of two distinct elements of $A$. Freiman and Lev conjectured that the cardinality of $2^{\wedge}A$ is greater than or equal to $a_{k-1}+k-2$ if $a_{k-1}\leqslant 2k-5$ and greater than or equal to $3k-7$ otherwise [V.F. Lev, Restricted set addition in groups, I. The classical setting, J. London Math. Soc. 62(2000), 27-40]. Up to now, Freiman-Lev conjecture is still open for all $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$. In this paper, we prove the Freiman-Lev conjecture is true for $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$ and $a_{k-2}&lt;2k-4$. Moreover, we determine some structures of $A$ when $|2^{\wedge}A|=3k-7$.</description>

      <title>Sup-norm bounds for Jacobi cusp forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give bounds for the natural invariant norm of cusp forms of real weight $k$ and character $\chi$ for any cofinite Fuchsian subgroup $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Using the representation of Jacobi cusp forms of integral weight $k$ and index $m$ for the modular group $\Gamma_{0}=\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ as linear combinations of modular forms of weight $k-\frac{1}{2}$ for some congruence subgroup of $\Gamma_{0}$ (depending on $m$) and suitable Jacobi theta functions, we derive bounds for the natural invariant norm of these Jacobi cusp forms. More specifically, letting $J_{k,m}^{\mathrm{cusp}}(\Gamma_{0})$ denote the complex vector space of Jacobi cusp forms under consideration and $\Vert\cdot\Vert_{\mathrm{Pet}}$ the pointwise Petersson norm on $J_{k,m}^{\mathrm{cusp}}(\Gamma_{0})$, we prove that for given $\epsilon&gt;0$, the bound \begin{align*} \sup_{(\tau,z)\in\mathbb{H}\times\mathbb{C}}\Vert f(\tau,z)\Vert_{\mathrm{Pet}}=O_{\epsilon}\big(k^{\frac{3}{4}}m^{1+\epsilon}\big) \end{align*} holds for any $f\in J_{k,m}^{\mathrm{cusp}}(\Gamma_{0})$, which is normalized with respect to the Petersson inner product, where the implied constant depends only on the choice of $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Fields of definition of dynamical systems on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Improvements on a result of Silverman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J. Silverman proved that a dynamical system on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ descends to the field of moduli if it is polynomial or it has even degree, but for non-polynomial ones of odd degree the picture is less clear. We give a complete characterization of which dynamical systems over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ descend to the field of moduli.</description>

      <title>On the Nori and Hodge realisations of Voevodsky \'etale motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the derived category of perverse Nori motives and mixed Hodge modules are the derived categories of their constructible hearts. This enables us to construct $\infty$-categorical lifts of the six operations and therefore to obtain realisation functors from the category of Voevodsky \'etale motives to the derived categories of perverse Nori motives and mixed Hodge modules that commute with the operations. We give a proof that the realisation induces an equivalence of categories between Artin motives in the category of \'etale motives and Artin motives in the derived category of Nori motives. We also prove that if a motivic $t$-structure exists then Voevodsky \'etale motives and the derived category of perverse Nori motives are equivalent. Finally we give a presentation of the indization of the derived category of perverse Nori motives as a category of modules in Voevodsky \'etale motives that gives a continuity result for perverse Nori motives.</description>
