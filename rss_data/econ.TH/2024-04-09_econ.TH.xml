      <title>Algorithmic Fairness and Social Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to guide high-stakes decisions about individuals. Consequently, substantial interest has developed around defining and measuring the ``fairness'' of these algorithms. These definitions of fair algorithms share two features: First, they prioritize the role of a pre-defined group identity (e.g., race or gender) by focusing on how the algorithm's impact differs systematically across groups. Second, they are statistical in nature; for example, comparing false positive rates, or assessing whether group identity is independent of the decision (where both are viewed as random variables). These notions are facially distinct from a social welfare approach to fairness, in particular one based on ``veil of ignorance'' thought experiments in which individuals choose how to structure society prior to the realization of their social identity. In this paper, we seek to understand and organize the relationship between these different approaches to fairness. Can the optimization criteria proposed in the algorithmic fairness literature also be motivated as the choices of someone from behind the veil of ignorance? If not, what properties distinguish either approach to fairness?</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Exchange Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers exchange of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and desire bundles of objects. Agents are assumed to have lexicographic preferences over bundles. We show that Top Trading Cycles (TTC) is characterized by efficiency, the weak endowment lower bound, balancedness, and truncation-proofness. In the classic Shapley--Scarf Economy, TTC is characterized by efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness. These results strengthen the uniqueness results of Ma (1994) and, more recently, Altunta\c{s} et al. (2023). In a model with variable endowments, TTC is susceptible to various forms of endowment manipulation. However, no rule is core-selecting and hiding-proof.</description>

      <title>Money Pumps and Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard criterion of rationality in economics is the maximization of a utility function that is stable across multiple observations of an agent's choice behavior. In this paper, we discuss two notions of the money pump that characterize two corresponding notions of utility-maximization. We explain the senses in which the amount of money that can be pumped from a consumer is a useful measure of the consumer's departure from utility-maximization.</description>

      <title>A many-to-one job market: more about the core and the competitive salaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies many-to-one assignment markets, or matching markets with wages. Although it is well-known that the core of this model is non-empty, the structure of the core has not been fully investigated. To the known dissimilarities with the one-to-one assignment game, we add that the bargaining set does not coincide with the core and the kernel may not be included in the core. Besides, not all extreme core allocations can be obtained by means of a lexicographic maximization or a lexicographic minimization procedure, as it is the case in the one-to-one assignment game.
  The maximum and minimum competitive salaries are characterized in two ways: axiomatically and by means of easily verifiable properties of an associated directed graph. Regarding the remaining extreme core allocations of the many-to-one assignment game, we propose a lexicographic procedure that, for each order on the set of workers, sequentially maximizes or minimizes each worker's competitive salary. This procedure provides all extreme vectors of competitive salaries, that is all extreme core allocations.</description>

      <title>Information Sale on Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a stylized model of a monopoly data seller when information-sharing network exists among data buyers. We show that, if the buyers' prior information is sufficiently noisy, the optimal selling strategy is characterized by a maximum independent set, which is the largest set of buyers who do not have information-sharing link at all. In addition, the precision of the seller's data decreases in the number of information-sharing links among buyers, but it is higher than the socially efficient level of precision.</description>

      <title>Designing Simple Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which mechanisms are simple to play? When is it easy for participants to see that a mechanism is incentive-compatible? I will start by explaining how and why economists came to ask these questions. Then I will discuss three recent answers, that capture different aspects of what makes a mechanism simple.</description>
