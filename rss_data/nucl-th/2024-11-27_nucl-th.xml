      <title>Universal Wong formula for capture cross sections from light to super-heavy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal Wong formula is proposed with refined model parameters for a systematic description of the capture cross sections for heavy-ion fusion reactions from C+C to Ni+U, in which the barrier parameters and the barrier distribution are determined by the entrance-channel nucleus-nucleus potential based on the Skyrme energy density functional. With introducing a constraint to the width of the barrier distribution and a pocket-depth dependent barrier radius, the capture excitation functions for a number of fusion reactions involving different nuclear structure effects are remarkably well reproduced, particularly for the reactions between light nuclei and those forming super-heavy nuclei. The systematic decreasing behavior of the geometric radii with the depth of capture pocket due to the influence of deep inelastic scattering is clearly observed in the TDHF calculations for super-heavy systems. The predicted capture cross sections for $^{54}$Cr + $^{238}$U at above barrier energies are evidently smaller than the corresponding results of more asymmetric projectile-target combination $^{50}$Ti + $^{242}$Pu due to the shallower capture pocket in Cr+U.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nuclear Deformation of Parent and Daughter Nuclei on One Proton Radioactivity Lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of nuclear deformation on proton-decay half-lives has been systematically studied in microscopic theoretical frameworks for a wide range of nuclei with Z&lt;82. Correlation between 1p-decay half-lives and the deformed nuclear shapes of both the parent and daughter nuclei has been investigated. Since the deformations of proton emitters and their residual nuclei impact the potential barrier and disintegration energy which are crucial for the accurate determination of half-lives, we incorporate the nuclear deformations of both the emitters and residues in a phenomenological manner and propose a new semi-empirical formula to estimate the 1p-decay half-lives. The robustness of this formula is demonstrated by the accurate predictions of the measured values while making it reliable for forecasting the properties of other potential proton emitters. The phenomenon of shape coexistence as observed in several proton emitters and their respective daughter nuclei, is particularly signicant in this context due to secondary minima in the potential energy surfaces of both the nuclei. Accounting for these factors signicantly affects the estimation of half-lives and branching ratios by introducing additional decay pathways and altering transition probabilities between different nuclear shapes.</description>

      <title>$^{19}$F$(p,\gamma)$$^{20}$Ne reaction rate and the puzzling calcium abundance in metal poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{19}$F$(p,\gamma)$$^{20}$Ne reaction is the only process to break out of the CNO cycle at temperature below 0.1 GK and may serve as the origin of calcium in first generation of stars after the Big Bang. In the recent measurement, the Jinping Underground Nuclear Experiment (JUNA) obtained the rate of $^{19}$F$(p,\gamma)$$^{20}$Ne reaction, significantly larger than the previously recommended values. In this work, we perform the theoretical studies of the $^{19}$F$(p,\gamma)$$^{20}$Ne reaction using the Gamow shell model in the coupled-channel representation (GSM-CC). At temperature around 0.1 GK, the predicted rate by GSM-CC is close to the rate found by JUNA. Thus, based on GSM-CC, the break-out reaction $^{19}$F$(p,\gamma)$$^{20}$Ne from the CNO-cycle might win over its competing reaction $^{19}$F$(p,\alpha)$$^{16}$O, and produce enough calcium in the metal poor stars.</description>

      <title>A solvable model for spin polarizations with flow-momentum correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytically solvable model based on the blast-wave picture of heavy-ion collisions with flow-momentum correspondence. It can describe the key features of spin polarizations in heavy-ion collisions. With the analytical solution, we can clearly show that the spin polarization with respect to the reaction plane is governed by the directed flow, while the spin polarization along the beam direction is governed by the ellipticity in flow and in transverse emission area. There is a symmetry between the contribution from the vorticity and from the shear stress tensor due to the flow-momentum correspondence. The solution can be improved systematically by perturbation method.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Unified description of structure and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Skyrme model Sk$\chi$450 constrained by the chiral effective field theory and the ground-state energies of doubly-magic nuclei, we explore the macroscopic static energy spectrum of dense matter. Structure of the matter is idealized as 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional periodic Coulomb lattices (pasta phases) at average baryon density in the range of $0.005n_0-0.5n_0$ with $n_0\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the inner crust of neutron stars. In the earlier work, the bulk and the surface nuclear properties in this scenario were described on the basis of different nuclear interactions. As a result, predictions for the inner crust structure based on those numerical results are not necessarily self-consistent. In this work, we solve this problem by describing the nuclear properties and proton-proton Cooper pairing in a unified manner, \emph{i.e.} based on the same nuclear interaction. We calculate the surface tension to the leading order (planar surface) and to the next-to-leading order (from nonzero principal curvature) at the Extended Thomas-Fermi level. Next, we develop and solve a system of equations within the compressible liquid drop model (LDM), which provides us with all necessary information about the macroscopic static energy spectrum of the nuclear structure. We find that the curvature corrections change the ground state in a relevant way. We also find that, typically, the energy differences between the different pasta phases are less than the thermal energy for temperatures $\sim10^8-10^9$ K, which implies that the real nuclear pasta phases are likely polymorphic. Finally, for 1-dimensional pasta phase we evaluate the superconducting coherence length of protons, the London penetration depth and the superconducting energy gap. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the pasta phases.</description>

      <title>Isomer triplets in odd-odd transitional rare earth nuclei: unique features, orbital systematics and characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of low-lying long-lived isomers, predominantly in odd-odd nuclei of the light rare-earth mass region, is investigated through an extensive survey of available nuclear data. The characteristics of these isomeric states and their systematics has revealed intriguing and unusual properties, including the identification of isomer triplets, a phenomenon specific to odd-odd deformed nuclei close to the transition region. This exclusive feature was observed in the following odd-odd nuclei, namely, 152Pm, 152Eu, 154Tb, 156Tb, 156Ho, 158Ho, 160Ho, 162Lu and 166Lu. We present a detailed overview of these isomer triplets by exploring the systematics of single-quasiparticle proton and neutron orbitals near the Fermi surface relevant in this mass region, to elucidate the factors responsible for their formation. The low-lying level structures of 156Tb and 154Tb, were constructed using the well-tested Two Quasiparticle Rotor Model to resolve the ambiguities in the spin, parity, energy and orbital configuration of these isomeric states. These results were extended to study the systematics of low-lying isomer triplets in the other five light rare-earth nuclei of interest. Our review and analysis of 1qp proton and neutron orbital systematics in the neighboring odd-mass isotopes and isotones highlights the crucial role of high-spin intruder neutron orbital in the formation of these isomer triplets.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulation of nucleon distribution and shell closure in the proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si is studied using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with high-fidelity chiral forces. Our results indicate that $^{22}$Si is more tightly bound than $^{20}$Mg, thereby excluding the possibility of two-proton emission. The $Z = 14$ shell closure in $^{22}$Si is supported by the evolution of the $2^+$ state in the neighboring nuclei. We then focus on the charge radius and spatial distribution information of $^{22}$Si, considering the novel phenomena that may emerge due to the small two-proton separation energy and the shell closure. We present the distribution of the $14$ protons and $8$ neutrons obtained from our lattice simulation, revealing insights into the spatial arrangement of the nucleons. Moreover, the spatial localization of the outermost proton and neutron suggests that $^{22}$Si is a doubly magic nucleus. Furthermore, we develop the pinhole method based on the harmonic oscillator basis, which gives insight into the nuclear structure in terms of the shell model picture from lattice simulations. Our calculated occupation numbers support that $Z = 14$ and $N = 8$ are the shell closures and show that the $\pi 1s_{1/2}$ orbital component is minor in $^{22}$Si.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear mass models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis and heavy element abundances in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of experimental data on extremely neutron-rich nuclei, theoretical values derived from nuclear physics models are essential for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Metal-poor stars enriched by the $r$-process offer valuable cases for studying the impact of nuclear physics models on $r$-process nucleosynthesis. This study analyzes four widely used nuclear physics models in detail: Finite-Range Droplet Model, Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov, Duflo-Zuker, and Weizs$\ddot{\rm a}$cker-Skyrme (WS4). Theoretical values predicted by the WS4 model are found to be in good agreement with experimental data, with deviations significantly smaller than those predicted by other models. The heavy element abundances observed in $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars can be accurately reproduced by $r$-process nucleosynthesis simulations using the WS4 model, particularly for the rare earth elements. This suggests that nuclear data provided by nuclear physics model like WS4 are both essential and crucial for $r$-process nucleosynthesis studies.</description>

      <title>Effect of chiral imbalance on the electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter using Green-Kubo Method within the 2-flavour gauged NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter is calculated using the 2-flavour gauged Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model in the presence of a chiral imbalance quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP). To this end, the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the vector current correlator is evaluated employing the real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. Taking the long wavelength limit of the spectral function we extract the electrical conductivity using the Green-Kubo relation. The thermal widths of the quarks/antiquarks that appear in the expression of electrical conductivity are calculated by considering the $2\to2$ scattering in the NJL model. The scattering amplitudes containing the polarization functions of the mesonic modes in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are also evaluated by considering finite value of CCP. We find that the ratio of electrical conductivity to temperature has significant dependence on CCP especially in the low temperature region.</description>

      <title>Constraints on color-flavored locked quark matter in view of the HESS J1731-347 event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the processes within compact stars hinges on astrophysical observations. A recent study reported on the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20} \ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.40_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ \rm{km}$, making it the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest that neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of about $1.17M_{\odot}$, raising the question: is this object a typical neutron star, or could it be our first encounter with an "exotic" star? To explore this, we employ the Color-Flavored Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), aiming to constrain it by integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 event with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we model hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, incorporating phase transitions via Maxwell construction. Our analysis indicates that CFL quark matter adequately explains all measurements, including the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. In contrast, hybrid models featuring CFL quark phases fail to account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and regeneration of charmonia within microscopic Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classical model to study the formation of charmonia, as well as dissociation and regeneration processes of heavy-quark bound states in the quark gluon plasma using Langevin simulations. The charm and anticharm quarks are described as Brownian particles in the background medium of light quarks and gluons and interact among them over a Coulomb-like screened potential to form bound states, which can dissociate again due to interactions with the medium. Box simulations at fixed temperature and volume are used to verify that the system reaches the expected thermal distribution in the equilibrium limit and to test bound state properties. The medium evolution is then parametrized by a boost-invariant fireball. In this configuration, the elliptic flow of charm and anticharm quarks as well as of charmonia is studied at RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Constraining the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with direct Urca processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density dependence of the symmetry energy in relativistic mean-field models with density dependent couplings is discussed in terms of the possible opening of nucleonic direct Urca processes inside neutron stars, which induce a very rapid cooling of the star. The modification of the parametrization of the isospin channel of two models, DD2 and DDMEX, keeping the same isoscalar properties is considered and the implications are discussed. Within the models discussed it is not possible the onset of nucleonic direct Urca processes in stars with a mass below $\sim1.6\,M_\odot$ if chiral effective field theory constraints for neutron matter are imposed. A Bayesian inference calculation confirms the low probability that nucleonic direct Urca processes occur inside stars with masses below 1.8$M_\odot$, considering the isoscalar channel of the equation of state described by DD2 or DDMEX and the same symmetry energy at saturation. The lowest masses allowing direct Urca processes are associated with a slope of the symmetry energy above $60$ MeV and most likely a positive symmetry energy incompressibility. It is shown that the parametrization of the isospin channel proposed destroys the correlation between symmetry energy slope and incompressibility previously identified in several works.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties and dark matter admixture with the NITR-I equation of state: Insights from observations and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent observational study has constrained the maximum mass of neutron stars (NSs), with particular attention to PSR J0952-0607 and the compact star remnant HESS J1731-347, especially in the low-mass regime. Building on our earlier work, which developed the NITR energy density functional (EDF) to reproduce the mass limit of PSR J0952-0607 but did not satisfy other observational constraints, this study introduces a refined EDF named ``NITR-I". NITR-I successfully reconciles the PSR J0952-0607 mass limit with observational data, including radius measurements from NICER+XMM and tidal deformability constraints from GW170817, demonstrating its robustness. The low-mass constraint associated with HESS J1731-347 indicates diverse NS compositions. Since NITR-I alone cannot satisfy this constraint, we explore the role of dark matter (DM) within NSs to bridge the gap. Incorporating DM, particularly at specific Fermi momentum values, enables the model to address this constraint. We further analyze the influence of DM on various NS properties, such as tidal deformability and non-radial $f$-mode oscillations, across multiple relativistic mean-field models. The presence of DM suggests a reduction in tidal deformability and shifts in oscillation frequencies, potentially offering detectable signatures in gravitational wave observations from neutron star mergers. Additionally, we investigate universal relations (URs) for DM-admixed NSs, focusing on correlations such as compactness versus tidal deformability and $f$-mode frequency versus tidal deformability. Canonical values for these properties are estimated using GW170817 data, offering further insights into the structure and composition of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Determination of the strong coupling constant and the Collins-Soper kernel from the energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted the first simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel using the energy-energy correlators (EEC) of $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions in the back-to-back limit. This analysis, based on the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization of EEC at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic ($\rm{N}^{3} \rm{LL}$) accuracy, yields $\alpha_s$ consistent with the world average. We have tested two different parametrizations for the non-perturbative CS kernel and found both to align with results obtained from lattice QCD and fits on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan process.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>
