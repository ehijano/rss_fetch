      <title>Animal social networks as intersections graphs of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study here the social network generated by the asynchronous visits, to a fixed set of sites, of mobile agents modelled as independent random walks on the plane lattice. The social network is constructed by assuming that a group of agents are associated if they have visited the same set of sites within a finite time interval. This construction is an instance of a random intersection graph, and has been used in the literature to study association networks in a number of animal species. We characterize the mathematical structure of these networks, which we view as one-mode projections of suitable bipartite graphs or, equivalently, as 2-sections of the corresponding hypergraphs. We determine analytically the probability distribution of the random bipartite graphs and hypergraphs associated to this construction, and suggest that association networks generated by the use of common resources are better described by hypergraphs rather than simple projected graphs, that miss important information regarding the actual associations among the agents.</description>

      <title>Practical Author Name Disambiguation under Metadata Constraints: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Astronomy Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to distinctly and properly collate an individual researcher's publications is crucial for ensuring appropriate recognition, guiding the allocation of research funding and informing hiring decisions. However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries.</description>

      <title>Modelling vehicle and pedestrian collective dynamics: Challenges and advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our urbanised societies, the management and regulation of traffic and pedestrian flows is of considerable interest for public safety, economic development, and the conservation of the environment. However, modelling and controlling the collective dynamics of vehicles and pedestrians raises several challenges. Not only are the individual entities self-propelled and hard to describe, but their complex nonlinear physical and social interactions makes the multi-agent problem of crowd and traffic flow even more involved. In this chapter, we purport to review the suitability and limitations of classical modelling approaches through four examples of collective behaviour: stop-and-go waves in traffic flow, lane formation, long-term avoidance behaviour, and load balancing in pedestrian dynamics. While stop-and-go dynamics and lane formation can both be addressed by basic reactive models (at least to some extent), the latter two require anticipation and/or coordination at the level of the group. The results highlight the limitations of classical force-based models, but also the need for long-term anticipation mechanisms and multiscale modelling approaches. In response, we review new developments and modelling concepts.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness and Resilience of U.S. Strategic Highways: A Network Science Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing transportation networks, offering insights into their structures and enabling the quantification of resilience and robustness. Understanding the underlying structures of transportation networks is crucial for effective infrastructure planning and maintenance. In military contexts, network science is valuable for analyzing logistics networks, critical for the movement and supply of troops and equipment. The U.S. Army's logistical success, particularly in the "fort-to-port" phase, relies heavily on the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) in the U.S., which is a system of public highways crucial for military deployments. However, the shared nature of these networks with civilian users introduces unique challenges, including vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and physical sabotage, which is highlighted by the concept of contested logistics. This paper proposes a method using network science and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the robustness and resilience of transportation networks, specifically applied to military logistics. Our findings indicate that while the STRAHNET is robust against targeted disruptions, it is more resilient to random disruptions.</description>

      <title>Contested logistics: Resilience of strategic highways and railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Military logistics rely heavily on public infrastructure, such as highways and railways, to transport troops, equipment, and supplies, linking critical installations through the Department of Defense's Strategic Highway Network and Strategic Rail Corridor Network. However, these networks are vulnerable to disruptions that can jeopardize operational readiness, particularly in contested environments where adversaries employ non-traditional threats to disrupt logistics, even within the homeland. This paper presents a contested logistics model that utilizes network science and Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate the robustness and resilience of strategic transportation networks under various disruption scenarios. By integrating GIS data to model logistics networks, simulating disruptions, and quantifying their impacts, we identified vulnerabilities in US power projection routes and assessed the resilience and robustness of highways and railways. Our findings reveal that highways are more resilient than railways, with greater capacity to absorb targeted disruptions. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing investments in highway infrastructure and reinforcing vulnerable road and rail segments, particularly in high-risk regions, to enhance the resilience of military logistics and maintain operational effectiveness in contested conditions.</description>

      <title>Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods game with tolerant punishment based on reputation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reputation and punishment are significant guidelines for regulating individual behavior in human society, and those with a good reputation are more likely to be imitated by others. In addition, society imposes varying degrees of punishment for behaviors that harm the interests of groups with different reputations. However, conventional pairwise interaction rules and the punishment mechanism overlook this aspect. Building on this observation, this paper enhances a spatial public goods game in two key ways: 1) We set a reputation threshold and use punishment to regulate the defection behavior of players in low-reputation groups while allowing defection behavior in high-reputation game groups. 2) Differently from pairwise interaction rules, we combine reputation and payoff as the fitness of individuals to ensure that players with both high payoff and reputation have a higher chance of being imitated. Through simulations, we find that a higher reputation threshold, combined with a stringent punishment environment, can substantially enhance the level of cooperation within the population. This mechanism provides deeper insight into the widespread phenomenon of cooperation that emerges among individuals.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Physical-Layer Information on Epidemic Spreading in Cyber-Physical Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since Granell et al. proposed a multiplex network for information and epidemic propagation, researchers have explored how information propagation affects epidemic dynamics. However, the role of individuals acquiring information through physical interactions has received relatively less attention. In this work, we introduce a novel source of information: physical layer information, and derive the epidemic outbreak threshold using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Our simulation results indicate that the outbreak threshold derived from the MMCA is consistent with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results, thereby confirming the accuracy of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find that the physical-layer information effectively increases the population's awareness density and the infection threshold $\beta_c$, while reducing the population's infection density, thereby suppressing the spreading of the epidemic. Another interesting finding is that when the density of 2-simplex information is relatively high, the 2-simplex plays a role similar to pairwise interaction, significantly enhancing the population's awareness density and effectively preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. In addition, our model works equally well for cyber physical systems with similar interaction mechanisms, while we simulate and validate it in a real grid system.</description>

      <title>SIS Epidemic Modelling on Homogeneous Networked System: General Recovering Process and Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although we have made progress in understanding disease spread in complex systems with non-Poissonian activity patterns, current models still fail to capture the full range of recovery time distributions. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, called the general recovering process SIS (grp-SIS) model. This model incorporates arbitrary recovery time distributions for infected nodes within the system. We derive the mean-field equations assuming a homogeneous network, provide solutions for specific recovery time distributions, and investigate the probability density function (PDF) for infection times in the system's steady state. Our findings show that recovery time distributions significantly affect disease dynamics, and we suggest several future research directions, including extending the model to arbitrary infection processes and using the quasistationary method to address deviations in numerical results.</description>
