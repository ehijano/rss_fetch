      <title>Taiyi: A high-performance CKKS accelerator for Practical Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a novel cryptographic theory enabling computation directly on ciphertext data, offers significant security benefits but is hampered by substantial performance overhead. In recent years, a series of accelerator designs have significantly enhanced the performance of FHE applications, bringing them closer to real-world applicability. However, these accelerators face challenges related to large on-chip memory and area. Additionally, FHE algorithms undergo rapid development, rendering the previous accelerator designs less perfectly adapted to the evolving landscape of optimized FHE applications. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of existing applications with the new FHE method, making two key observations: 1) the bottleneck of FHE applications shifts from NTT to the inner-product operation, and 2) the optimal {\alpha} of KeySwitch changes with the decrease in multiplicative level. Based on these observations, we designed an accelerator named Taiyi, which includes specific hardware for the inner-product operation and optimizes the NTT and BConv operations through algorithmic derivation. A comparative evaluation of Taiyi against previous state-of-the-art designs reveals an average performance improvement of 1.5x and reduces the area overhead by 15.7%.</description>

      <title>A 28.6 mJ/iter Stable Diffusion Processor for Text-to-Image Generation with Patch Similarity-based Sparsity Augmentation and Text-based Mixed-Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an energy-efficient stable diffusion processor for text-to-image generation. While stable diffusion attained attention for high-quality image synthesis results, its inherent characteristics hinder its deployment on mobile platforms. The proposed processor achieves high throughput and energy efficiency with three key features as solutions: 1) Patch similarity-based sparsity augmentation (PSSA) to reduce external memory access (EMA) energy of self-attention score by 60.3 %, leading to 37.8 % total EMA energy reduction. 2) Text-based important pixel spotting (TIPS) to allow 44.8 % of the FFN layer workload to be processed with low-precision activation. 3) Dual-mode bit-slice core (DBSC) architecture to enhance energy efficiency in FFN layers by 43.0 %. The proposed processor is implemented in 28 nm CMOS technology and achieves 3.84 TOPS peak throughput with 225.6 mW average power consumption. In sum, 28.6 mJ/iteration highly energy-efficient text-to-image generation processor can be achieved at MS-COCO dataset.</description>
