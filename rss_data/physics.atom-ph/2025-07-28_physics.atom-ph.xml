      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of k-vectors in situ with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping in situ the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local extra recoil effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>A continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet laser for the nuclear clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th at around 148.4 nm offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realisation of a nuclear clock. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of $^{229}$Th nuclei in transparent crystals and the development of pulsed vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation. Here we introduce and demonstrate the first continuous-wave laser at 148.4 nm, generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in cadmium vapor. The source delivers 100 nW of power with a linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm, marking a major advance in laser technology. We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique to place a stringent upper bound on the phase noise induced by the FWM process and demonstrate sub-hertz linewidth capability. These results eliminate the final technical hurdle to a $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clock, opening new directions in quantum metrology, nuclear quantum optics and precision tests of the Standard Model. More broadly, they establish a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for applications across quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Post-collision interaction in the liquid phase: the role of electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of post-collision interaction (PCI) in a liquid medium. We investigate PCI for the Auger KLL electrons of solvated Cl$^-$, K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$. All three isoelectronic ions exhibit a very similar PCI behavior, which is little affected by changing the solvent from water to methanol or ethanol. The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in condensed media is the screening of Coulombic interactions, and scattering of the electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a previously reported semi-classical PCI theory modified to account for screening and scattering. We show that a better agreement with experiment can be obtained by instead modeling scattering using electron transport Monte-Carlo simulations. We suggest that, in turn, PCI experimental data could be used as another experimental constraint to refine the currently insufficiently well-known scattering parameters of low-energy electrons in water, which are crucial in many fields.</description>

      <title>A general approximator for strong-field ionization rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to retrieve sub-optical-cycle dynamics of strong-field ionization from ionization probabilities obtained for a set of few-cycle laser pulses that covers a sufficiently broad parameter space. To this end, we introduce a General Approximator for Strong-Field Ionization Rates (GASFIR). Unlike existing analytical models of multiphoton ionization, GASFIR is a retrieval tool. It has a few adjustable parameters that provide the flexibility required to accurately reconstruct ab initio data. At the same time, GASFIR imposes only the most essential constraints on ionization rates, which makes it suitable for time-domain investigations of complex quantum phenomena that influence strong-field ionization. We benchmark GASFIR for atomic hydrogen. By examining the quasistatic limit of GASFIR, we demonstrate its relationship to well-established theories of tunneling ionization and show that it accurately reproduces published quasistatic rates for tunneling ionization.</description>
