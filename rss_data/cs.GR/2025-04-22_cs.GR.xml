      <title>PyFRep: Shape Modeling with Differentiable Function Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for performing differentiable geometric modeling based on the Function Representation (FRep). The framework is built on top of modern libraries for performing automatic differentiation allowing us to obtain derivatives w.r.t. space or shape parameters. We demonstrate possible applications of this framework: Curvature estimation for shape interrogation, signed distance function computation and approximation and fitting shape parameters of a parametric model to data. Our framework is released as open-source.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Unified Framework for Photorealistic Reconstruction and Intrinsic Scene Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PRISM, a unified framework that enables multiple image generation and editing tasks in a single foundational model. Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</description>

      <title>HoLa: B-Rep Generation using a Holistic Latent Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel representation for learning and generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models in the form of $\textit{boundary representations}$ (B-Reps). Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a $\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. $\approx$50%.</description>

      <title>Can AI Recognize the Style of Art? Analyzing Aesthetics through the Lens of Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) recognizes style through style transfer-an AI technique that generates a new image by applying the style of one image to another. Despite the considerable interest that style transfer has garnered among researchers, most efforts have focused on enhancing the quality of output images through advanced AI algorithms. In this paper, we approach style transfer from an aesthetic perspective, thereby bridging AI techniques and aesthetics. We analyze two style transfer algorithms: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the other utilizing recent Transformer models. By comparing the images produced by each, we explore the elements that constitute the style of artworks through an aesthetic analysis of the style transfer results. We then elucidate the limitations of current style transfer techniques. Based on these limitations, we propose potential directions for future research on style transfer techniques.</description>

      <title>SEGA: Drivable 3D Gaussian Head Avatar from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating photorealistic 3D head avatars from limited input has become increasingly important for applications in virtual reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Integration of Remote Sensing -- A Review with Four Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a high-level discipline, the development of remote sensing depends on the contribution of many other basic and applied disciplines and technologies. For example, due to the close relationship between remote sensing and photogrammetry, remote sensing would inevitably integrate disciplines such as optics and color science. Also, remote sensing integrates the knowledge of electronics in the conversion from optical signals to electrical signals via CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or other image sensors. Moreover, when conducting object identification and classification with remote sensing data, mathematical morphology and other digital image processing technologies are used. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg of interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing. This work briefly reviews the interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing with four examples - ecology, mathematical morphology, machine learning, and electronics.</description>

      <title>A Controllable Appearance Representation for Flexible Transfer and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method that computes an interpretable representation of material appearance within a highly compact, disentangled latent space. This representation is learned in a self-supervised fashion using an adapted FactorVAE. We train our model with a carefully designed unlabeled dataset, avoiding possible biases induced by human-generated labels. Our model demonstrates strong disentanglement and interpretability by effectively encoding material appearance and illumination, despite the absence of explicit supervision. Then, we use our representation as guidance for training a lightweight IP-Adapter to condition a diffusion pipeline that transfers the appearance of one or more images onto a target geometry, and allows the user to further edit the resulting appearance. Our approach offers fine-grained control over the generated results: thanks to the well-structured compact latent space, users can intuitively manipulate attributes such as hue or glossiness in image space to achieve the desired final appearance.</description>

Abstract: This Master's Thesis in Computer Science dives into the design and creation of a user-friendly interface for VoxLogicA, an image analysis tool using spatial model checking with a focus on neuroimaging. The research tackles the problem of existing tools being too complex, which makes them hard for medical professionals and researchers to use. By using spatial logic, the goal is to make these powerful analytical tools more practical and accessible in real-world clinical settings. The main objectives are to design a modern web interface that's easy to use, build it with the latest web technologies (e.g. Svelte and Niivue), and test its effectiveness through user studies and real-world case analyses.</description>

      <title>Semantic Direct Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current direct modeling systems limit users to low-level interactions with vertices, edges, and faces, forcing designers to manage detailed geometric elements rather than focusing on high-level design intent. This paper introduces semantic direct modeling (SDM), a novel approach that lifts direct modeling from low-level geometric modifications to high-level semantic interactions. This is achieved by utilizing a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned with CAD-specific prompts, which can guide the LLM to reason through design intent and accurately interpret CAD commands, thereby allowing designers to express their intent using natural language. Additionally, SDM maps design intent to the corresponding geometric features in the CAD model through a new conditional, context-sensitive feature recognition method, which uses generative AI to dynamically assign feature labels based on design intent. Together, they enable a seamless flow from high-level design intent to low-level geometric modifications, bypassing tedious software interactions. The effectiveness of SDM has been validated through real mechanical design cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation is essential for robotics research, enabling safe and efficient testing of perception, control, and navigation algorithms. However, achieving both photorealistic rendering and accurate physics modeling remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel simulation framework--the Unreal Robotics Lab (URL) that integrates the Unreal Engine's advanced rendering capabilities with MuJoCo's high-precision physics simulation. Our approach enables realistic robotic perception while maintaining accurate physical interactions, facilitating benchmarking and dataset generation for vision-based robotics applications. The system supports complex environmental effects, such as smoke, fire, and water dynamics, which are critical for evaluating robotic performance under adverse conditions. We benchmark visual navigation and SLAM methods within our framework, demonstrating its utility for testing real-world robustness in controlled yet diverse scenarios. By bridging the gap between physics accuracy and photorealistic rendering, our framework provides a powerful tool for advancing robotics research and sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Rendering of Glints in the Presence of Area Lights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world materials are characterized by a glittery appearance. Reproducing this effect in physically based renderings is a challenging problem due to its discrete nature, especially in real-time applications which require a consistently low runtime. Recent work focuses on glittery appearance illuminated by infinitesimally small light sources only. For light sources like the sun this approximation is a reasonable choice. In the real world however, all light sources are fundamentally area light sources. In this paper, we derive an efficient method for rendering glints illuminated by spatially constant diffuse area lights in real time. To this end, we require an adequate estimate for the probability of a single microfacet to be correctly oriented for reflection from the source to the observer. A good estimate is achieved either using linearly transformed cosines (LTC) for large light sources, or a locally constant approximation of the normal distribution for small spherical caps of light directions. To compute the resulting number of reflecting microfacets, we employ a counting model based on the binomial distribution. In the evaluation, we demonstrate the visual accuracy of our approach, which is easily integrated into existing real-time rendering frameworks, especially if they already implement shading for area lights using LTCs and a counting model for glint shading under point and directional illumination. Besides the overhead of the preexisting constituents, our method adds little to no additional overhead.</description>

      <title>Explorable INR: An Implicit Neural Representation for Ensemble Simulation Enabling Efficient Spatial and Parameter Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing computational power available for high-resolution ensemble simulations in scientific fields such as cosmology and oceanology, storage and computational demands present significant challenges. Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</description>

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity and temporally smooth 3D human motion generation remains a challenge, particularly within resource-constrained environments. We introduce FlowMotion, a novel method leveraging Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). FlowMotion incorporates a training objective within CFM that focuses on more accurately predicting target motion in 3D human motion generation, resulting in enhanced generation fidelity and temporal smoothness while maintaining the fast synthesis times characteristic of flow-matching-based methods. FlowMotion achieves state-of-the-art jitter performance, achieving the best jitter in the KIT dataset and the second-best jitter in the HumanML3D dataset, and a competitive FID value in both datasets. This combination provides robust and natural motion sequences, offering a promising equilibrium between generation quality and temporal naturalness.</description>

      <title>Learning Human Perspective in Line Drawings from Single Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artist-drawn sketches only loosely conform to analytical models of perspective projection. This deviation of human-drawn perspective from analytical perspective models is persistent and well known, but has yet to be algorithmically replicated or even well understood. Capturing human perspective can benefit many computer graphics applications, including sketch-based modeling and non-photorealistic rendering. We propose the first dedicated method for learning and replicating human perspective. A core challenge in learning this perspective is the lack of suitable large-scale data, as well as the heterogeneity of human drawing choices. We overcome the data paucity by learning, in a one-shot setup, from a single artist sketch of a given 3D shape and a best matching analytical camera view of the same shape. We match the contours of the depicted shape in this view to corresponding artist strokes. We then learn a spatially continuous local perspective deviation function that modifies the camera perspective projecting the contours to their corresponding strokes while retaining key geometric properties that artists strive to preserve when depicting 3D content. We leverage the observation that artists employ similar perspectives when depicting shapes from slightly different view angles to algorithmically augment our training data. First, we use the perspective function learned from the single example to generate more human-like contour renders from nearby views; then, we pair these renders with the analytical camera contours from these views and use these pairs as additional training data. The resulting learned perspective functions are well aligned with the training sketch perspectives and are consistent across views. We compare our results to potential alternatives, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach, and showcasing applications that benefit from learned human perspective.</description>

      <title>A-OctoMap: An Adaptive OctoMap for Online Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Downsampling and path planning are essential in robotics and autonomous systems, as they enhance computational efficiency and enable effective navigation in complex environments. However, current downsampling methods often fail to preserve crucial geometric information while maintaining computational efficiency, leading to challenges such as information loss during map reconstruction and the need to balance precision with computational demands. Similarly, current graph-based search algorithms for path planning struggle with fixed resolutions in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate obstacle detection and suboptimal or failed pathfinding. To address these issues, we introduce an adaptive OctoMap that utilizes a hierarchical data structure. This innovative approach preserves key geometric information during downsampling and offers a more flexible representation for pathfinding within fixed-resolution maps, all while maintaining high computational efficiency. Simulations validate our method, showing significant improvements in reducing information loss, enhancing precision, and boosting the computational efficiency of map reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods. For path planning, our approach enhances Jump Point Search (JPS) by increasing the success rate of pathfinding and reducing path lengths, enabling more reliable navigation in complex scenes.</description>

      <title>Edge-preserving noise for diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01540</link>

Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results (FID and CLIP score) showing consistent improvements of up to 30% for both tasks.</description>

      <title>DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 45% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</description>
