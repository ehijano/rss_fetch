      <title>Resolving the Nature of the Lowest-Frequency Raman Mode of Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lowest-frequency Raman mode of water, observed through depolarized light scattering or optical Kerr effect techniques, is routinely used to track dynamic changes in water molecules near ions or biomolecules. Yet, the microscopic origin of this mode and its relation to dielectric relaxation still remains debated for pure water with conflicting interpretations attributing it to either translational or rotational molecular motions. In this study, we compute the low-frequency Raman spectrum in the GHz to THz range using ab initio simulations, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data. Detailed decomposition analysis reveals that the rotational and translational contributions are equally important, while strong negative orientational cross-correlations as well as internal field effects significantly modify the rotational component, making it distinct from expectations inferred from dielectric spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Chromatographic Peak Shape from Stochastic Model: Analytic Time-Domain Expression in Terms of Physical Parameters and Conditions under which Heterogeneity Reduces Tailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A time-domain representation of chromatographic peak shapes is presented as an analytic expression designed for high computational efficiency, which can be used for direct time-domain peak fitting with parameters that represent physical quantities. The underlying model integrates the effects of axial diffusion (molecular and multipath/eddy), finite initial spatial variance, and two distinct retention mechanisms: one characterized by a high rate of short-duration events (fast kinetics), and another by a low rate of long-duration events (slow kinetics). Fits to experimental chromatograms yield substantially smaller residual standard error (RSE) than the standard EMG and the lowest average normalised RSE among 12 established peak-shape functions in the examined cases. The stochastic approach is reformulated using single-particle probability laws, providing a rigorous basis for future theoretical extensions. The validity of the foundational Poisson assumption is critically examined by deriving expressions for the excess variance caused by correlated microscopic retention rate fluctuations. A statistical interpretation of the HETP is presented and used to determine a lower bound on the number of microscopic retention events from chromatogram-derived macroscopic observables. This, in turn, justifies the applicability of the Gaussian limit for the mobile-plus-fast component, as established by analysis of the cumulant generating function of the closed-form benchmark derived herein. The contribution from the slow-kinetic mechanism is incorporated via a decoupling approximation, whose validity is established through a cumulant-based analysis that explicitly bounds the decoupling-induced error. Finally, the notion that mechanistic heterogeneity necessarily exacerbates peak tailing is qualified, analytically delineating parameter regions in which it leads to a reduction in peak asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Atomistic Mechanism of Rare Events in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable reaction coordinates are essential for understanding rare conformational transitions in molecular dynamics. The Atomistic Mechanism Of Rare Events in Molecular Dynamics (AMORE-MD) framework enhances interpretability of deep-learned reaction coordinates by connecting them to atomistic mechanisms, without requiring any a priori knowledge of collective variables, pathways, or endpoints. Here, AMORE-MD employs the ISOKANN algorithm to learn a neural membership function $\chi$ representing the dominant slow process, from which transition pathways are reconstructed as minimum-energy paths aligned with the gradient of $\chi$, and atomic contributions are quantified through gradient-based sensitivity analysis. Iterative enhanced sampling further enriches transition regions and improves coverage of rare events enabling recovery of known mechanisms and chemically interpretable structural rearrangements at atomic resolution for the M\"uller-Brown potential, alanine dipeptide, and the elastin-derived hexapeptide VGVAPG.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity. We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Third-Body Stabilization of Supercritical CO2 in CO Oxidation: Development and Application of a New ReaxFF Force Field for the CO/O/CO2 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) plays a crucial role as a solvent in separation processes, advanced power cycles, and green chemical and materials processing. Nonetheless, the atomistic comprehension of how the dense scCO2 matrix influences the fundamental combustion of carbon monoxide (CO) is still insufficiently explored. Experimental studies and traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations frequently fail to detect the highly reactive, transient intermediates, such as atomic oxygen (O), that drive these reactions. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a novel ReaxFF reactive force field for the CO2/CO/O system. To effectively model CO2 crystal properties, intermolecular interactions, bond energies, and critical reaction energy barriers, the force field parameters were calibrated using data obtained from the density functional theory and second-order Moller-Plesset calculations. The force field was able to reproduce the cohesive energy of the CO2 crystal, the pressure characteristics of bulk scCO2, and the structural properties of liquid and scCO2, as documented by experiments, ab-initio MD, and prominent non-reactive models. The force field was subsequently applied to study the CO + O = CO2 reaction. In a dilute gas-phase environment, the reaction exhibits inefficiency as the newly formed CO2 rapidly dissociates back due to substantial kinetic energy acquired from the exothermic reaction. Conversely, in a dense scCO2 environment, the surrounding CO2 matrix acts as an efficient third body, stabilizing the emerging CO2 product by dissipating its excess energy via molecular collisions. As such, this ReaxFF force field facilitates a unique, large-scale reactive MD description of radical chemistry in scCO2 and establishes a mechanistic foundation for third-body stabilization in dense reactive environments.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Assessment of $\mathrm{Th}^{3+}$ Properties for Nuclear Clock and Fundamental Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing singles, doubles, and triples excitations within the relativistic coupled-cluster framework, we perform comprehensive calculations of a wide range of atomic properties for the Th$^{3+}$ ion. These properties are essential for advancing nuclear clock technology and probing fundamental physics. Combining our isotope shift parameters with experimental data, we estimate highly accurate values of the differential nuclear charge radii for $^{232,229}$Th and $^{229m,229}$Th. Additionally, we determine the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for both the ground and isomeric states of $^{229}$Th by combining measured hyperfine structure constants with our theoretical calculations. Our precise evaluations of electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are critical for assessing systematic uncertainties in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$-based nuclear clock. Notably, we observe unexpectedly significant contributions from higher-order relativistic effects and excitations involving orbitals with higher angular momentum, which markedly influence the energies of the ground state and its fine-structure partner. These results highlight the substantial challenges in achieving highly accurate predictions for these properties.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic study of mixed lithium halides solid state electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium halides with the general formula Li$_x$M$_y$X$_6$, where M indicates transition metal ions and X halide anions are very actively studied as solid-state electrolytes, because of relatively low cost, high stability and Li conductivity. The structure and properties of these halide-based solid electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions. Here we focus on the Li$_3$YCl$_{6x}$Br$_{6(1-x)}$ system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity. We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter -- although it can also trigger transition between different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25\% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the P$\bar{3}$m1 phase.</description>

      <title>Towards Improved Quantum Machine Learning for Molecular Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the use of equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) for generating molecular force fields, focusing on the rMD17 dataset. We consider a QNN architecture based on previous research and point out shortcomings in the parametrization of the atomic environments. These shortcomings limit its expressivity as an interatomic potential and precludes transferability between molecules. We propose a revised QNN architecture that addresses these shortcomings. While both QNNs show promise in force prediction, with the revised architecture showing improved accuracy, they struggle with energy prediction. Further, both QNNs architectures fail to demonstrate a meaningful scaling law of decreasing errors with increasing training data. These findings highlight the challenges of scaling QNNs for complex molecular systems and emphasize the need for improved encoding strategies, regularization techniques, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Focused Sampling for Low-Cost and Accurate Ehrenfest Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</description>

      <title>Interradical motion can push magnetosensing precision towards quantum limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</description>
