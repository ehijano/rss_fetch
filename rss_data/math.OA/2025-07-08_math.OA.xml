      <title>Lifting isomorphisms in $K$-theory through gradings of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every strongly $\mathbb{Z}$-graded C*-algebra (equivalently, every C*-algebra carrying a strongly continuous $\mathbb{T}$-action with full spectral subspaces) is a Cuntz--Pimsner algebra, and describe subalgebras and subspaces that can be used as the coefficient algebra and module in the construction. We deduce that for surjective graded homomorphisms $\phi$ of C*-algebras $A$ graded by torsion-free abelian groups $H$, if the restriction $\phi_0$ of $\phi$ to the zero-graded component $A_0$ of $A$ induces isomorphisms in K-theory, so does $\phi$ itself. When $H$ is free abelian, we show how to pick out smaller subalgebras of $A_0$ on which it suffices to check that $\phi$ induces isomorphisms in $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Fisher's approach to deformation of coactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to the deformation of $C^*$-algebras via coactions of locally compact groups, emphasizing Fischer's construction in the context of maximal coactions. We establish a rigorous framework for understanding how deformations arise from group coactions, extending previous work by Bhowmick, Neshveyev, and Sangha. Using Landstad duality, we compare different deformation procedures, demonstrating their equivalence and efficiency in constructing twisted versions of given $C^*$-algebras. Our results provide deeper insights into the interplay between exotic crossed products, coaction duality, and operator algebra deformations, offering a unified perspective for further generalizations.</description>

      <title>The quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $m \geq n/4$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>

      <title>A local quantization principle for inclusions of tracial von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local quantization principle (after Sorin Popa~\cite{popa 94} and \cite{popa 95}) of inclusions of tracial von Neumann algebras. Let $(\mathcal{M},\tau)$ be a type ${\rm II}_1$ von Neumann algebra and let $\mathcal{N}\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ be a type ${\rm II}_1$ von Neumann subalgebra. Let $x_1,\ldots, x_m \in \mathcal{M}$ and $ \epsilon&gt; 0$. Then there exists a partition of 1 with projections $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}$ in $\mathcal{N}$ such that \[\left\|\sum_{i=1}^n p_{i}\left(x_j-E_{\mathcal{N}'\cap \mathcal{M}}(x_j)\right)p_{i}\right\|_{2}&lt;\epsilon,\quad 1\leq j\leq m.\] In particular, if $\mathcal{N}\subseteq \mathcal{M}$ is an inclusion of type $\rm II_{1}$ factors with $[\mathcal{M}:\mathcal{N}]=2$, then for any $x_{1},\ldots, x_{m}\in \mathcal{M}$, there exists a partition of 1 with projections $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}$ in $\mathcal{N}$ such that \[\sum_{i=1}^n p_ix_jp_i=\tau(x_j)1, \quad 1\leq j\leq m.\] Equivalently, there exists a unitary operator $u\in \mathcal{N}$ such that \[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nu^{*i}x_j u^i=\tau(x_j)1, \quad 1\leq j\leq m.\]</description>

      <title>W*-correlations of II$_1$ factors and rigidity of tensor products and graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variant of Gromov's notion of measure equivalence for groups has been introduced for II$_1$ factors under different names. We propose the terminology of W*-correlated II$_1$ factors. We prove rigidity results up to W*-correlations for tensor products and graph products of II$_1$ factors. As a consequence, we construct the first uncountable family of discrete groups $\Gamma$ that are not von Neumann equivalent, which means that their group von Neumann algebras $L(\Gamma)$ are not W*-correlated, and which implies that these groups are neither measure equivalent, nor have isomorphic or virtually isomorphic group von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of our work is to map the landscape of the frustration-free quantum spin models over the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group. This is achieved by establishing equivariant connections with the spaces of hereditary C*-algebras of the underlying quasi-local algebra of observables, and of open projections of its double dual.</description>

      <title>The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform: structure, convolution theorem and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03911v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform (WQPFT) combines the localization capabilities of windowed transforms with the phase modulation structure of the quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT). This paper investigates fundamental properties of the WQPFT, including linearity, shifting, modulation, conjugation, and symmetry. In addition, we derive the reproducing kernel, establish a reconstruction formula, and characterize the range of the transform. Convolution theorems in both the spectral and spatial domains are developed, along with the existence results and norm estimates for the convolution operation associated with the WQPFT. Finally, as an application, the solution of a convolution equation is given using the convolution theorem of the WQPFT.</description>

      <title>Tighter Inequalities for $A$-Numerical Radii of Operator Matrices and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes new upper bounds for the $A$-numerical radius of operator matrices in semi-Hilbertian spaces by leveraging the $A$-Buzano inequality and developing refined techniques for operator matrices. We present several sharp inequalities that generalize and improve existing results, including novel bounds for $2 \times 2$ operator matrices involving $A$-absolute value operators and mixed Schwarz-type inequalities, refined power inequalities relating $A$-numerical radius to operator norms with optimal parameter selection, and a unified framework extending classical numerical radius inequalities to semi-Hilbertian spaces. The results are supported by detailed examples demonstrating their sharpness, including cases of equality, and we investigate their relationship to classical numerical radius inequalities, showing how our framework provides tighter estimates through $A$-operator seminorms and $A$-adjoint techniques. These theoretical advances have applications in quantum mechanics (operator bounds for quantum channels), partial differential equations (stability analysis of discretized operators), and control theory (hybrid system energy management). Our work contributes to operator theory in semi-Hilbertian spaces by providing new tools for analyzing operator matrices through $A$-numerical radius inequalities, with particular emphasis on the interplay between operator structure and the semi-inner product induced by positive operators.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</description>

      <title>On amenability constants of Fourier algebras: new bounds and new examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group. If $G$ is finite then the amenability constant of its Fourier algebra, denoted by ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$, admits an explicit formula [Johnson, JLMS 1994]; if $G$ is infinite then no such formula for ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$ is known, although lower and upper bounds were established by Runde [PAMS 2006]. Using non-abelian Fourier analysis, we obtain a sharper upper bound for ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$ when $G$ is discrete. Combining this with previous work of the first author [Choi, IMRN 2023], we exhibit new examples of discrete groups and compact groups where ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$ can be calculated explicitly; previously this was only known for groups that are products of finite groups with ``degenerate'' cases. Our new examples also provide additional evidence to support the conjecture that Runde's lower bound for the amenability constant is in fact an equality.</description>

      <title>Almost commuting self-adjoint operators and measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem when an almost commuting $n$-tuple self-adjoint operators in an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space $H$ is close to an $n$-tuple of commuting self-adjoint operators on $H.$ We give an affirmative answer to the problem when the synthetic-spectrum and the essential synthetic-spectrum are close. Examples are also exhibited that, in general, the answer to the problem when $n\ge 3$ is negative even the associated Fredholm index vanishes. In the case that $n=2,$ we show that a pair of almost commuting self-adjoint operators in an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space is close to a commuting pair of self-adjoint operators if and only if a corresponding Fredholm index vanishes outside of an essential synthetic-spectrum. This is an attempt to solve a problem proposed by David Mumford related to quantum theory and measurements.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots representing the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries, showing that free independence extends to several larger algebras containing $u_j$ in the ultraproduct of matrices $\prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we prove free independence of the Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$. The Pinsker algebra $\mathcal{P}_j$ is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy defined by Hayes; $\mathcal{P}_j$ in particular contains the relative commutant $\{u_j\}' \cap \prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$, more generally any unitary that can be connected to $u_j$ by a sequence of commuting pairs of Haar unitaries, and any unitary $v$ such that $v\mathcal{P}_j v^* \cap \mathcal{P}_j$ is diffuse. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields (in the Connes-embeddable case) a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants. It also yields a new proof of the general absorption results for Connes-embeddable free products obtained by the first author, Hayes, Nelson, and Sinclair.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

      <title>Absolute dilation of Fourier multipliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal M}$ be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal semifinite faithful (nsf) trace. We say that an operator $T :{\mathcal M}\to {\mathcal M}$ is absolutely dilatable if there exist another von Neumann algebra $M$ with an nsf trace, a unital normal trace preserving $\ast$-homomorphism $J: {\mathcal M} \to M$, and a trace preserving $\ast$-automorphism $U: M \to M$ such that $T^k = {\mathbb E}_J U^k J \quad \text{for all } k \geq 0,$ where ${\mathbb E}_J: M \to {\mathcal M}$ is the conditional expectation associated with $J$. For a discrete amenable group $G$ and a function $u:G\to\mathbb{C}$ inducing a unital completely positive Fourier multiplier $M_u: VN(G) \to VN(G)$, we establish the following transference theorem: the operator $M_u$ admits an absolute dilation if and only if its associated Herz-Schur multiplier does. From this result, we deduce a characterization of Fourier multipliers with an absolute dilation in this setting. Building on the transference result, we construct the first known example of a unital completely positive Fourier multiplier that does not admit an absolute dilation. This example arises in the symmetric group ${\mathcal S}_3$, the smallest group where such a phenomenon occurs. Moreover, we show that for every abelian group $G$, every Fourier multiplier always admits an absolute dilation.</description>

Abstract: We study the homotopy type of the space of the unitary group $\U_1(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$ of the uniform Roe algebra $C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|)$ of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We show that the stabilizing map $\U_1(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))\to\U_\infty(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$ is a homotopy equivalence. Moreover, when $n=1,2$, we determine the homotopy type of $\U_1(C^\ast_u(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$, which is the product of the unitary group $\U_1(C^\ast(|\mathbb{Z}^n|))$ (having the homotopy type of $\U_\infty(\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathbb{Z}\times B\U_\infty(\mathbb{C})$ depending on the parity of $n$) of the Roe algebra $C^\ast(|\mathbb{Z}^n|)$ and rational Eilenberg--MacLane spaces.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable designs and design-based shadow tomography from random lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate state designs for continuous-variable quantum systems using the aid of lattice-like quantum states. These are code states of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that for an n-mode system, the set of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design. We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.</description>

      <title>Branched coarse coverings and transfer maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of branched coarse coverings and transfers between coarse homology theories along them. We show that various versions of coarse $K$-homology theories admit the additional structure of transfers. We show versions of Atiyah's $L^{2}$-index theorem in coarse homotopy theory and apply them to give a new argument for the corresponding step in Higson's counterexample to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>
