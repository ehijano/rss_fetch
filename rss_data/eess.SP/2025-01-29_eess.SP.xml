      <title>Interference in Wireless Networks -- A Power Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-Channel Interference (CCI) is a fundamental problem in wireless communication networks. It is a well-studied problem in the field. As channels use the same frequency, interference in the radio waves occurs which, in turn, reduces the capacity of the interfered channels. There is a need to use the least number of frequencies as communication networks advance to 5G. In this paper, we present a novel technique to manage interference on channels. We use time division for links of the same frequency and, as a result, we show a significant reduction in the number of frequencies used overall in the network.</description>

      <title>A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.</description>

      <title>RNN-Based Models for Predicting Seizure Onset in Epileptic Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early management and better clinical outcomes for epileptic patients depend on seizure prediction. The accuracy and false alarm rates of existing systems are often compromised by their dependence on static thresholds and basic Electroencephalogram (EEG) properties. A novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based method for seizure start prediction is proposed in the article to overcome these limitations. As opposed to conventional techniques, the proposed system makes use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal correlations from unprocessed EEG data. It enables the system to adapt dynamically to the unique EEG patterns of each patient, improving prediction accuracy. The methodology of the system comprises thorough data collecting, preprocessing, and LSTM-based feature extraction. Annotated EEG datasets are then used for model training and validation. Results show a considerable reduction in false alarm rates (average of 6.8%) and an improvement in prediction accuracy (90.2% sensitivity, 88.9% specificity, and AUC-ROC of 93). Additionally, computational efficiency is significantly higher than that of existing systems (12 ms processing time, 45 MB memory consumption). About improving seizure prediction reliability, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RNN-based strategy, opening up possibilities for its practical application to improve epilepsy treatment.</description>

      <title>MambaTron: Efficient Cross-Modal Point Cloud Enhancement using Aggregate Selective State Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud enhancement is the process of generating a high-quality point cloud from an incomplete input. This is done by filling in the missing details from a reference like the ground truth via regression, for example. In addition to unimodal image and point cloud reconstruction, we focus on the task of view-guided point cloud completion, where we gather the missing information from an image, which represents a view of the point cloud and use it to generate the output point cloud. With the recent research efforts surrounding state-space models, originally in natural language processing and now in 2D and 3D vision, Mamba has shown promising results as an efficient alternative to the self-attention mechanism. However, there is limited research towards employing Mamba for cross-attention between the image and the input point cloud, which is crucial in multi-modal problems. In this paper, we introduce MambaTron, a Mamba-Transformer cell that serves as a building block for our network which is capable of unimodal and cross-modal reconstruction which includes view-guided point cloud completion.We explore the benefits of Mamba's long-sequence efficiency coupled with the Transformer's excellent analytical capabilities through MambaTron. This approach is one of the first attempts to implement a Mamba-based analogue of cross-attention, especially in computer vision. Our model demonstrates a degree of performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art techniques while using a fraction of the computation resources.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Enabled Site Specific Channel Precoding: Over the Air CIR Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the significance of designing a reliable, intelligent, and true physical environment-aware precoding scheme by leveraging an accurately designed channel twin model to obtain realistic channel state information (CSI) for cellular communication systems. Specifically, we propose a fine-tuned multi-step channel twin design process that can render CSI very close to the CSI of the actual environment. After generating a precise CSI, we execute precoding using the obtained CSI at the transmitter end. We demonstrate a two-step parameters' tuning approach to design channel twin by ray tracing (RT) emulation, then further fine-tuning of CSI by employing an artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm can significantly reduce the gap between actual CSI and the fine-tuned digital twin (DT) rendered CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed novel approach in designing a true physical environment-aware channel twin model.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Smart Helper Placement for Enhanced Cache Efficiency in F-RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart helpers (SHs) have been proposed to improve content delivery delays and alleviate high fronthaul loads in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). They offer an alternative to deploying additional enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which are often infeasible due to site constraints.} The optimal placement of SHs can significantly increase the number of users they serve which leads to enhanced cache efficiency and improved content delivery delay. In this letter, we optimize SH placement within an F-RAN to maximize the cache hit rate and further reduce the content delivery latency. We model the SH cache hit rate as a function of outage probability and user density distribution. We develop a function to estimate user density distribution leveraging the radial basis functions (RBFs) method and optimize SH placement utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. \an{Our} numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing the \an{SH cache hit rate}, thereby improving delivery delays and fronthaul loads of the network.</description>

      <title>Subject Representation Learning from EEG using Graph Convolutional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose GC-VASE, a graph convolutional-based variational autoencoder that leverages contrastive learning for subject representation learning from EEG data. Our method successfully learns robust subject-specific latent representations using the split-latent space architecture tailored for subject identification. To enhance the model's adaptability to unseen subjects without extensive retraining, we introduce an attention-based adapter network for fine-tuning, which reduces the computational cost of adapting the model to new subjects. Our method significantly outperforms other deep learning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results with a subject balanced accuracy of 89.81% on the ERP-Core dataset and 70.85% on the SleepEDFx-20 dataset. After subject adaptive fine-tuning using adapters and attention layers, GC-VASE further improves the subject balanced accuracy to 90.31% on ERP-Core. Additionally, we perform a detailed ablation study to highlight the impact of the key components of our method.</description>

      <title>FlowDAS: A Flow-Based Framework for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for improving the accuracy of state estimation in complex dynamical systems by integrating observational data with physical models. Traditional solutions rely on either pure model-driven approaches, such as Bayesian filters that struggle with nonlinearity, or data-driven methods using deep learning priors, which often lack generalizability and physical interpretability. Recently, score-based DA methods have been introduced, focusing on learning prior distributions but neglecting explicit state transition dynamics, leading to limited accuracy improvements. To tackle the challenge, we introduce FlowDAS, a novel generative model-based framework using the stochastic interpolants to unify the learning of state transition dynamics and generative priors. FlowDAS achieves stable and observation-consistent inference by initializing from proximal previous states, mitigating the instability seen in score-based methods. Our extensive experiments demonstrate FlowDAS's superior performance on various benchmarks, from the Lorenz system to high-dimensional fluid super-resolution tasks. FlowDAS also demonstrates improved tracking accuracy on practical Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) task, showcasing its effectiveness in complex flow field reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit via deep learning with Wi-Fi probe requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study contributes to the advancement of vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit (AGT) systems using Wi-Fi probe requests and deep learning models. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating various approaches to occupancy estimation, particularly in the context of MAC address randomization. While many methods proposed in the literature claim effectiveness in simpler experimental settings, our research reveals that those methods are unreliable in the complex environment of AGT systems. Specifically, techniques for handling randomized MAC addresses and distinguishing between passenger and non-passenger data do not perform well in AGT systems. Despite challenges in tracking individual devices, our study demonstrates that accurate occupancy estimation using Wi-Fi probe requests remains feasible. A pilot study conducted on the Miami-Dade Metromover, an AGT system characterized by frequent stops, significant occupancy fluctuations, and absence of fare collection devices, provides a robust testing ground for the framework. Additionally, our findings show that deep learning models significantly outperform machine learning models in this context. The insights from this study can significantly enhance decision-making for transit agencies to optimize operations and elevate service quality.</description>

      <title>MFConvTr: Multi-Frequency Convolutional Transformer for Fetal Arrhythmia Detection in Non-Invasive fECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NI-fECG have emerged as alternative for fetal arrhythmia monitoring. But due to multi-signal waveform they are tough to understand and due to highly varying and complex nature traditional fiducial methods cannot be applied. Further, it has also been observed that the fetal arrhythmia can be differentiated from the normal signals in both spectral and temporal scales. To this end, we propose Multi-Frequency Convolutional Transformer, a novel deep learning architecture that learns information in contexts with multiple-frequency and can model long-term dependencies. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional-backbone consisting of model Multi-Frequency Convolutions (MF-Conv) and residual connections. MF-Conv in-turn captures multi-frequency contexts in an efficient manner by splitting the input channel and then convoluting each of the splits individually with different kernel size. Accredited to these properties, the proposed model attains state-of-the-art results and that too utilizing very low number of parameters. To evaluate the proposed we also perform extensive ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Towards reconstruction of Pulsed-wave Doppler signals from Non-invasive fetal ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal cardiac health monitoring with invasive methods have a limited viability because they can only be utilized during labor and are uncomfortable. On the other hand non-invasive fECG are adulterated with maternal ECG, and hence resulting in poor analysis. In contrast, Pulsed-wave Doppler (PwD) echocardiography generates high-quality signals representing fetal blood volume inflow-outflow. It also follows non-invasive signal acquisition. The only drawback is that it requires highly expensive setup. To address this aspect, we put forward a challenging research question - can we reconstruct PwD signals using non-invasive fetal ECG?</description>

      <title>From Partial Calibration to Full Potential: A Two-Stage Sparse DOA Estimation for Incoherently-Distributed Sources with Gain-Phase Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for incoherently distributed (ID) sources is essential in multipath wireless communication scenarios, yet it remains challenging due to the combined effects of angular spread and gain-phase uncertainties in antenna arrays. This paper presents a two-stage sparse DOA estimation framework, transitioning from partial calibration to full potential, under the generalized array manifold (GAM) framework. In the first stage, coarse DOA estimates are obtained by exploiting the output from a subset of partly-calibrated arrays (PCAs). In the second stage, these estimates are utilized to determine and compensate for gain-phase uncertainties across all array elements. Then a sparse total least-squares optimization problem is formulated and solved via alternating descent to refine the DOA estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method attained improved estimation accuracy compared to existing approaches, while maintaining robustness against both noise and angular spread effects in practical multipath environments.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Strategies for Coordinated Beamforming in Multicell ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two cooperative beamforming frameworks based on federated learning (FL) for multi-cell integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. Our objective is to address the following dilemma in multicell ISAC: 1) Beamforming strategies that rely solely on local channel information risk generating significant inter-cell interference (ICI), which degrades network performance for both communication users and sensing receivers in neighboring cells; 2) conversely centralized beamforming strategies can mitigate ICI by leveraging global channel information, but they come with substantial transmission overhead and latency that can be prohibitive for latency-sensitive and source-constrained applications. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a partially decentralized training framework motivated by the vertical federated learning (VFL) paradigm. In this framework, the participating base stations (BSs) collaboratively design beamforming matrices under the guidance of a central server. The central server aggregates local information from the BSs and provides feedback, allowing BSs to implicitly manage ICI without accessing the global channel information. To make the solution scalable for densely deployed wireless networks, we take further steps to reduce communication overhead by presenting a fully decentralized design based on the horizontal federated learning (HFL). Specifically, we develop a novel loss function to control the interference leakage power, enabling a more efficient training process by entirely eliminating local channel information exchange. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions can achieve significant performance improvements comparable to the benchmarks in terms of both communication and radar information rates.</description>

      <title>Experimental Outdoor Performance Evaluation of TVWS Narrowband Data Communication using SDR Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band leads to spectrum congestion and requires multiple gateways to cover wide areas. This will increase cost, complexity, and energy consumption. TV White Spaces (TVWS) provides an abundant spectrum that is sufficient for low data rate IoT applications. This low-frequency band offers coverage over larger areas due to the ability of wireless signals to penetrate obstacles and terrain. In this paper, we examine the performance of narrowband data communications in TVWS through an outdoor experiment in a suburban area with line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation scenarios. We implement a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and develop a GNU radio benchmark tool to perform outdoor experiments for TVWS narrowband data communication between a gateway and wireless nodes at various locations. The results reveal that the system can achieve a throughput of up to 97 Kbps with a packet error rate (PER) and packet loss rate (PLR) under 1% over NLOS paths, making it suitable for low-data rate applications. This work offers valuable insights for designing the physical layer of narrowband white space devices (WSDs). The developed benchmark tool will also greatly assist other researchers in evaluating the performance of SDR-based communication systems.</description>

      <title>Modular Framework for Uncertainty Prediction in Autonomous Vehicle Motion Forecasting within Complex Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modular modeling framework designed to enhance the capture and validation of uncertainty in autonomous vehicle (AV) trajectory prediction. Departing from traditional deterministic methods, our approach employs a flexible, end-to-end differentiable probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture. This modular design allows the encoder and decoder to be trained independently, enabling seamless adaptation to diverse traffic scenarios without retraining the entire system. Our key contributions include: (1) a probabilistic heatmap predictor that generates context-aware occupancy grids for dynamic forecasting, (2) a modular training approach that supports independent component training and flexible adaptation, and (3) a structured validation scheme leveraging uncertainty metrics to evaluate robustness under high-risk conditions. To highlight the benefits of our framework, we benchmark it against an end-to-end baseline, demonstrating faster convergence, improved stability, and flexibility. Experimental results validate these advantages, showcasing the capacity of the framework to efficiently handle complex scenarios while ensuring reliable predictions and robust uncertainty representation. This modular design offers significant practical utility and scalability for real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>DFCon: Attention-Driven Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents our approach for the IEEE SP Cup 2025: Deepfake Face Detection in the Wild (DFWild-Cup), focusing on detecting deepfakes across diverse datasets. Our methodology employs advanced backbone models, including MaxViT, CoAtNet, and EVA-02, fine-tuned using supervised contrastive loss to enhance feature separation. These models were specifically chosen for their complementary strengths. Integration of convolution layers and strided attention in MaxViT is well-suited for detecting local features. In contrast, hybrid use of convolution and attention mechanisms in CoAtNet effectively captures multi-scale features. Robust pretraining with masked image modeling of EVA-02 excels at capturing global features. After training, we freeze the parameters of these models and train the classification heads. Finally, a majority voting ensemble is employed to combine the predictions from these models, improving robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. The proposed system addresses the challenges of detecting deepfakes in real-world conditions and achieves a commendable accuracy of 95.83% on the validation dataset.</description>

      <title>Meta-Federated Learning: A Novel Approach for Real-Time Traffic Flow Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient management of traffic flow in urban environments presents a significant challenge, exacerbated by dynamic changes and the sheer volume of data generated by modern transportation networks. Traditional centralized traffic management systems often struggle with scalability and privacy concerns, hindering their effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel approach by combining Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) to create a decentralized, scalable, and adaptive traffic management system. Our approach, termed Meta-Federated Learning, leverages the distributed nature of FL to process data locally at the edge, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing latency. Simultaneously, ML enables the system to quickly adapt to new traffic conditions without the need for extensive retraining. We implement our model across a simulated network of smart traffic devices, demonstrating that Meta-Federated Learning significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and response time. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable adaptability to sudden changes in traffic patterns, suggesting a scalable solution for real-time traffic management in smart cities. This study not only paves the way for more resilient urban traffic systems but also exemplifies the potential of integrated FL and ML in other real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive multipliers for extrapolation in frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving the details of an object from coarse-scale measurements is a classical problem in applied mathematics. This problem is usually formulated as extrapolating the Fourier transform of the object from a bounded region to the entire space, that is, in terms of performing extrapolation in frequency. This problem is ill-posed unless one assumes that the object has some additional structure. When the object is compactly supported, then it is well-known that its Fourier transform can be extended to the entire space. However, it is also well-known that this problem is severely ill-conditioned.
  In this work, we assume that the object is known to belong to a collection of compactly supported functions and, instead performing extrapolation in frequency to the entire space, we study the problem of extrapolating to a larger bounded set using dilations in frequency and a single Fourier multiplier. This is reminiscent of the refinement equation in multiresolution analysis. Under suitable conditions, we prove the existence of a worst-case optimal multiplier over the entire collection, and we show that all such multipliers share the same canonical structure. When the collection is finite, we show that any worst-case optimal multiplier can be represented in terms of an Hermitian matrix. This allows us to introduce a fixed-point iteration to find the optimal multiplier. This leads us to introduce a family of multipliers, which we call $\Sigma$-multipliers, that can be used to perform extrapolation in frequency. We establish connections between $\Sigma$-multipliers and multiresolution analysis. We conclude with some numerical experiments illustrating the practical consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Capacity of Byzantine Symmetric Private Information Retrieval and Its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the asymptotic capacity of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) with $B$ Byzantine servers. Prior to finding the capacity, a definition for the Byzantine servers is needed since in the literature there are two different definitions. In \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where it was first defined, the Byzantine servers can send any symbol from the storage, their received queries and some independent random symbols. In \cite{unresponsive_byzantine_1}, Byzantine servers send any random symbol independently of their storage and queries. It is clear that these definitions are not identical, especially when \emph{symmetric} privacy is required. To that end, we define Byzantine servers, inspired by \cite{byzantine_tpir}, as the servers that can share everything, before and after the scheme initiation. In this setting, we find an upper bound, for an infinite number of messages case, that should be satisfied for all schemes that protect against this setting and develop a scheme that achieves this upper bound. Hence, we identify the capacity of the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) alongside the emergence of Open RAN (ORAN) architectures presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities in Radio Resource Management (RRM) for next-generation communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches designed to enhance URLLC performance within ORAN's flexible and dynamic framework. By investigating various DRL strategies for optimising RRM parameters, we explore the intricate balance between reliability, latency, and the newfound adaptability afforded by ORAN principles. Through extensive simulation results, our study compares the efficacy of different DRL models in achieving URLLC objectives in an ORAN context, highlighting the potential of DRL to navigate the complexities introduced by ORAN. The proposed study provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of DRL-based RRM solutions in ORAN-enabled wireless networks. It sheds light on the benefits and challenges of integrating DRL and ORAN for URLLC enhancements. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on advancements in URLLC and ORAN, offering a roadmap for future research to pursue efficient, reliable, and flexible communication systems.</description>

      <title>Whole Heart Perfusion with High-Multiband Simultaneous Multislice Imaging via Linear Phase Modulated Extended Field of View (SMILE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a simultaneous multislice (SMS) first-pass perfusion technique that can achieve whole heart coverage with high multi-band factors, while avoiding the issue of slice leakage.
  Methods: The proposed Simultaneous Multislice Imaging via Linear phase modulated Extended field of view (SMILE) treats the SMS acquisition and reconstruction within an extended field of view framework, allowing arbitrarily under-sampling of phase encoding lines of the extended k-space matrix and enabling the direct application of 2D parallel imaging reconstruction techniques. We presented a theoretical framework that offers insights into the performance of SMILE. We performed retrospective comparison on 28 subjects and prospective perfusion experiments on 43 patients undergoing routine clinical CMR studies with SMILE at multiband (MB) factors of 3-5, with a net acceleration rate ($R$) of 8 and 10 respectively, and compared SMILE to conventional SMS techniques using standard FOV 2D CAIPI acquisition and standard 2D slice separation techniques including split-slice GRAPPA and ROCK-SPIRiT.
  Results: Retrospective studies demonstrated 5.2 to 8.0 dB improvement in signal to error ratio (SER) of SMILE over CAIPI perfusion. Prospective studies showed good image quality with grades of 4.1 $\pm$ 0.7 for MB = 3, $R$ = 8 and 3.5 $\pm$ 1.0 for MB = 5, $R$ = 10. (5-point Likert Scale)
  Conclusion: The theoretical derivation and experimental results validate the SMILE's improved performance at high acceleration and MB as compared to the existing 2D CAIPI SMS acquisition and reconstruction techniques for first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional RIS Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) that supports signal reflection, refraction, amplification, and target sensing simultaneously. Our MF-RIS aims to enhance integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems, particularly in multi-user and multi-target scenarios. Equipped with reflection and refraction components (i.e., amplifiers and phase shifters), MF-RIS is able to adjust the amplitude and phase shift of both communication and sensing signals on demand. Additionally, with the assistance of sensing elements, MF-RIS is capable of capturing the echo signals from multiple targets, thereby mitigating the signal attenuation typically associated with multi-hop links. We propose a MF-RIS-enabled multi-user and multi-target ISAC system, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of sensing targets. This problem involves jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations, subject to constraints on the communication rate, total power budget, and MF-RIS coefficients. We decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three sub-problems, and then solve them via an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The performance of MF-RIS varies under different operating protocols, and energy splitting (ES) exhibits the best performance in the considered MF-RIS-enabled multi-user multi-target ISAC system; 2) Under the same total power budget, the proposed MF-RIS with ES protocol attains 52.2%, 73.5% and 60.86% sensing SINR gains over active RIS, passive RIS, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS), respectively; 3) The number of sensing elements will no longer improve sensing performance after exceeding a certain number.</description>

      <title>A Novel Comprehensive Multiport Network Model for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) Characterization and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent transformative technologies for next-generation wireless communications, offering advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation. While RIS have been extensively studied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept to multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization challenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing an optimization framework for SIM that, unlike previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive model without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for broader applicability of the results. We first present a model based on multi-port network theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative object (ECO) and derive a general framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the SIM as an ECO with a specific architecture, providing insights into SIM optimization for various architectures and discussing the complexity in each case. Finally, we analyze the impact of commonly used assumptions, demonstrating that employing a complete model - one that does not rely on the unilateral hypothesis and accounts for mutual coupling among SIM elements - can yield better performance, using the realization of a 2D DFT as a case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges in areas including neuroscience, cognitive science, and medical diagnostics, where accurately detecting minority classes is essential for robust model performance. This study addresses the issue of class imbalance, using the `Liking' label in the DEAP dataset as an example. Such imbalances are often overlooked by prior research, which typically focuses on the more balanced arousal and valence labels and predominantly uses accuracy metrics to measure model performance. To tackle this issue, we adopt numerical optimization techniques aimed at maximizing the area under the curve (AUC), thus enhancing the detection of underrepresented classes. Our approach, which begins with a linear classifier, is compared against traditional linear classifiers, including logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Our method significantly outperforms these models, increasing recall from 41.6\% to 79.7\% and improving the F1-score from 0.506 to 0.632. These results highlight the efficacy of AUC maximization via numerical optimization in managing imbalanced datasets, providing an effective solution for enhancing predictive accuracy in detecting minority but crucial classes in out-of-sample datasets.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Joint Detection and Decoding on the Binary-Input AWGN Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For asynchronous transmission of short blocks, preambles for packet detection contribute a non-negligible overhead. To reduce the required preamble length, joint detection and decoding (JDD) techniques have been proposed that additionally utilize the payload part of the packet for detection. In this paper, we analyze two instances of JDD, namely hybrid preamble and energy detection (HyPED) and decoder-aided detection (DAD). While HyPED combines the preamble with energy detection for the payload, DAD also uses the output of a channel decoder. For these systems, we propose novel achievability and converse bounds for the rates over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. Moreover, we derive a general bound on the required blocklength for JDD. Both the theoretical bound and the simulation of practical codebooks show that the rate of DAD quickly approaches that of synchronous transmission.</description>

      <title>Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided Asymmetric MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or ``phantom'' antennas at the users, bridging the performance gains of the min-$G$ and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations.</description>
