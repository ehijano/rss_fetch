      <title>LILAD: Learning In-context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification in control theory aims to approximate dynamical systems from trajectory data. While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Automated Enumeration of Reconfigurable Architectures for Thermal Management Systems in Battery Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the automotive industry moves towards vehicle electrification, designing and optimizing thermal management systems (TMSs) for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) has become a critical focus in recent years. The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities.</description>

      <title>Quantized Distributed Estimation with Event-triggered Communication and Packet Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of quantized distributed estimation with event-triggered communication and packet loss, aiming to reduce the number of transmitted bits. The main challenge lies in the inability to differentiate between an untriggered event and a packet loss occurrence. This paper proposes an event-triggered distributed estimation algorithm with quantized communication and quantized measurement, in which it introduces a one-bit information reconstruction method to deal with packet loss. The almost sure convergence and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are established.Besides, it is demonstrated that the global average communication bit-rate decreases to zero over time. Moreover, the trade-off between communication rate and convergence rate is revealed, providing guidance for designing the communication rate required to achieve the algorithm's convergence rate. A numerical example is supplied to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Network Safe Tracking Controllers from Backward Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of tracking controllers that closely follow a reference trajectory while ensuring safety and robustness against disturbances is a challenging problem in the control of autonomous systems. In this work, we propose a neural network-based safe tracking control framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems with reach-avoid specifications in the presence of disturbances. Our approach begins with generation of a nominal trajectory using standard trajectory synthesis approaches, followed by construction of safe zonotopic backward reachable sets along the nominal trajectory. The states lying within the backward reachable sets are guaranteed to satisfy safe reachability specifications. Then, our key insight is to leverage the computed backward reachable sets to inform the architecture and training of a neural network-based tracking controller such that the neural network drives the system's states through these backward reachable sets, thereby improving the likelihood of safe reachability. We perform formal verification with conformal prediction to achieve statistical safety guarantees on the performance of the learned neural controller. The performance of our approach is illustrated through a numerical example on the discrete-time Dubin's car model.</description>

      <title>Communication-Aware Dissipative Control for Networks of Heterogeneous Nonlinear Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication-aware control is essential to reduce costs and complexity in large-scale networks. However, it is challenging to simultaneously determine a sparse communication topology and achieve high performance and robustness. This work achieves all three objectives through dissipativity-based, sparsity-promoting controller synthesis. The approach identifies an optimal sparse structure using either weighted l1 penalties or alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) with a cardinality term, and iteratively solves a convexified version of the NP hard structured optimal control problem. The proposed methods are demonstrated on heterogeneous networks with uncertain and unstable agents.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Kalman Filter and Smoother for Benchmark Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose analytical mean square error (MSE) expressions for the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother (KS) for benchmark studies, where the true system dynamics are unknown or unavailable to the estimator. In such cases, as in benchmark evaluations for target tracking, the analysis relies on deterministic state trajectories. This setting introduces a model mismatch between the estimator and the system, causing the covariance estimates to no longer reflect the actual estimation errors. To enable accurate performance prediction for fixed state trajectories without relying on computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations, we derive recursive MSE expressions with linear time complexity. The proposed framework also accounts for measurement model mismatch and provides an efficient tool for performance evaluation in benchmark studies with long trajectories. Simulation results confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>CBF Based Quadratic Program for Trajectory Tracking of Underatuated Marine Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing two polar coordinates transformations, the marine vessel's original two-input-three-output second-order tracking model can be reduced to a two-input-two-output feedback form. However, the resulting system does not confirm to the strict-feedback structure, leading to potential singularity when designing the stabilizing function for the virtual input in the recursive controller design. Moreover, the polar coordinate transformation itself inherently introduces singularities. To address these singularity issues, this paper employs a control barrier function (CBF) based approach and formulates the trajectory tracking problem as a quadratic program (QP) solved via a QP optimizer. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Smart Traffic Systems: A Comprehensive Review of Recent Advancements, Technologies, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an ever-growing urban population, the need for transportation is increasing at an alarming rate. Thus, the massive increase in the number of vehicles is creating traffic congestion which creates various environmental, societal, and economic problems. To tackle traffic-related issues, several Smart Traffic Systems (STS) have been proposed and implemented. As a result, a comprehensive review of STS has become necessary. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview and a thorough review of the existing STSs in terms of various technological approaches, traffic detection technologies using different sensors, various networking/communication tools, and their pros and cons. The paper also provides information on major STS services. In addition, challenges related to modern STS are identified. Therefore, the taxonomy of STSs provided in this paper will aid researchers, urban planners, and policymakers to recognize and install the best-suited STSs for their settings.</description>

      <title>Output-Feedback Stabilizing Policy Iteration for Convergence Assurance of Unknown Discrete-Time Systems with Unmeasurable States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note proposes a data-driven output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration for unknown linear discrete-time systems with unmeasurable states. Existing policy iteration methods for optimal control must start from a stabilizing control policy, which is particularly challenging to obtain for unknown systems, especially when states are unavailable. In such cases, it is more difficult to guarantee stability and convergence performance. To address this problem, an output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration framework is developed to learn closed-loop stabilizing control policies while ensuring convergence performance. Specifically, cumulative scalar parameters are introduced to compress the original system to a stable scale. Then, by integrating modified policy iteration with parameter update rules, the system is gradually amplified/restored to the original system while preserving stability such that the stabilizing control policy is obtained. The entire process is driven solely by input-output data. Moreover, a stability analysis is provided for output-feedback. The proposed approach is validated by simulations.</description>

      <title>An Equality Set Projection Approach for TSO-DSO Coordination Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated optimization dispatch (COD) of transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO) can effectively ensure system security and efficiency under high-penetration distributed energy resource (DER) integration. Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching. Therefore, it is less sensitive to the increase of vertices and could efficiently construct the projection of high-dimensional FR. Case studies on a polyhedron dataset, IEEE 33-Bus System and T118D10 TSO-DSO system demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed COD approach.</description>

      <title>Joint Scheduling of Workload Demand and Energy Supply in Low-carbon Data Centers with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distributed Koopman Operator Learning for Perception and Safe Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and scalable framework for predictive and safe autonomous navigation in dynamic transportation environments by integrating model predictive control (MPC) with distributed Koopman operator learning. High-dimensional sensory data are employed to model and forecast the motion of surrounding dynamic obstacles. A consensus-based distributed Koopman learning algorithm enables multiple computational agents or sensing units to collaboratively estimate the Koopman operator without centralized data aggregation, thereby supporting large-scale and communication-efficient learning across a networked system. The learned operator predicts future spatial densities of obstacles, which are subsequently represented through Gaussian mixture models. Their confidence ellipses are approximated by convex polytopes and embedded as linear constraints in the MPC formulation to guarantee safe and collision-free navigation. The proposed approach not only ensures obstacle avoidance but also scales efficiently with the number of sensing or computational nodes, aligning with cooperative perception principles in intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. Theoretical convergence guarantees and predictive constraint formulations are established, and extensive simulations demonstrate reliable, safe, and computationally efficient navigation performance in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Learning the MPC objective function from human preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), the objective function plays a central role in determining the closed-loop behavior of the system, and must therefore be designed to achieve the desired closed-loop performance. However, in real-world scenarios, its design is often challenging, as it requires balancing complex trade-offs and accurately capturing a performance criterion that may not be easily quantifiable in terms of an objective function. This paper explores preference-based learning as a data-driven approach to constructing an objective function from human preferences over trajectory pairs. We formulate the learning problem as a machine learning classification task to learn a surrogate model that estimates the likelihood of a trajectory being preferred over another. The approach provides a surrogate model that can directly be used as an MPC objective function. Numerical results show that we can learn objective functions that provide closed-loop trajectories that align with the expressed human preferences.</description>

      <title>A model predictive control framework with customer-priority tiers for virtual power plant resilience during extreme weather: A UK heatwave case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and storms, power systems around the globe are having to deal with increased imbalance between demand and supply and additional risk of loss of supply, calling for advanced control strategies that strengthen system resilience. This paper develops a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for coordination of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) that manages photovoltaic (PV) systems, batteries, and loads before, during, and after extreme weather events. A multi-objective mixed-integer quadratically constrained program is solved to enforce customer-priority tiers, serving critical loads first, while minimizing operating cost and PV curtailment under network and device constraints. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with real UK heatwave data show that, under realistic forecast errors and modeling uncertainties, MPC improves resilience by 11-20% relative to traditional full-horizon optimization. These results indicate the practical viability of receding-horizon coordination for resilient, low-carbon VPP operation during extreme weather.</description>

      <title>A Cyber-Physical Systems Framework for Tracking Post Thermal-Runaway Temperature and Smoke Dynamics in Underground Mines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground mining operations are actively exploring the use of large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to power their equipment. LIBs have high energy density, long cycle life, and favorable safety record. They also have low noise, heat, and emission footprints. This fosters a conducive workplace environment for underground mining personnel. However, many occurrences of LIB failure have resulted in dangerous situations in underground mines. The combustion products, including toxic emissions, can rapidly travel throughout the mine using the ventilation network. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the temperature and smoke concentration underground at all times to ensure the safety of the miners. High-fidelity models can be developed for specific scenarios of LIB failure, but are computationally prohibitive for large underground mine volumes, complex geometries, and long duration combustion events. To mitigate computation-related issues associated with high-fidelity models, we developed cyber-physical systems (CPS) models to examine temperature and smoke dynamics. The mine supervisory control center, acting as the cyber framework, operates in conjunction with the physical underground mine. The CPS models, trained on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model data sets, present an exceptional estimate of the evolution of temperature and smoke concentration in the underground mine tunnel. Once implemented, the research results can help mine operators make informed decisions during emergencies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Singular Perturbation-based Model Reduction for Heterogeneous Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems are globally experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and complexity due to the advent of nonconventional generation and consumption technologies. To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation. However, several technical assumptions enabling traditional approaches are being challenged due to the heterogeneous, and often black-box, nature of modern power system component models. This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model. Numerical studies on a test system featuring synchronous machines, inverters, and line dynamics demonstrate the generalizability and accuracy of the developed approaches.</description>

      <title>Switching control of underactuated multi-channel systems with input constraints for cooperative manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an event-triggered switching control framework for a class of nonlinear underactuated multi-channel systems with input constraints. These systems are inspired by cooperative manipulation tasks involving underactuation, where multiple underactuated agents collaboratively push or pull an object to a target pose. Unlike existing approaches for multi-channel systems, our method addresses underactuation and the potential loss of controllability by additionally addressing channel assignment of agents. To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching. The proposed framework is further validated through numerical simulations on 2D and 3D free-flyer systems and multi-robot nonprehensile pushing tasks.</description>

      <title>Power System Robust State Estimation As a Layer: A Novel End-to-end Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serving as an essential prerequisite for modern power system operation, robust state estimation (RSE) could effectively resist noises and outliers in measurements. The emerging neural network (NN) based end-to-end (E2E) learning framework enables real-time application of RSE but cannot strictly enforce the physical constraints involved, potentially yielding solutions that are statistically accurate yet physically inconsistent. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel E2E learning based RSE framework, where the RSE problem is innovatively constructed as an explicit differentiable layer of NN for the first time, ensuring physics alignments with rigors. Also, the measurement weights are treated as learnable parameters of NN to enhance estimation robustness. A hybrid loss function is formulated to pursue accurate and physically consistent solutions. To realize the proposed NN structure, the original non-convex RSE problem is specially relaxed. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the SE performance while fulfilling physical consistency on six testing systems, in comparisons to the classical E2E learning based approach and the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach.</description>

      <title>Switching-time bioprocess control with pulse-width-modulated optogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biotechnology can benefit from dynamic control to improve production efficiency. In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity.</description>

      <title>Fast Distributed Algorithm for Aggregative Games in Malicious Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the distributed Nash Equilibrium seeking problem for aggregative games, where legitimate players' decisions are affected by potential malicious players. To describe players' behavior, we introduce a novel heterogeneous trustworthiness probabilistic framework by employing stochastic trust observations. To mitigate the waste of communication and gradient computation, we utilize a compressible unbalanced network information matrix and a multi-round communication mechanism to develop a fast Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm for aggregative games with unbalanced directed networks. By integrating the multi-round communication mechanism and a trustworthiness broadcast mechanism, we embed our fast convergence algorithm into the heterogeneous trustworthiness probabilistic framework, yielding a resilient fast Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm. Theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of the algorithm. Comparative simulations verify the accuracy of our fast convergence algorithm, and validation simulations verify the resilience of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>RDS-DeePC: Robust Data Selection for Data-Enabled Predictive Control via Sensitivity Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) offers a powerful model-free approach to predictive control, but faces two fundamental challenges: computational complexity scaling cubically with dataset size, and severe performance degradation from corrupted data. This paper introduces Robust Data Selection DeePC (RDS-DeePC), which addresses both challenges through influence function analysis. We derive a sensitivity score quantifying each trajectory segment's leverage on the optimization solution, proving that high-sensitivity segments correspond to outliers while low-sensitivity segments represent consistent data. By selecting low-sensitivity segments, RDS-DeePC achieves computational efficiency and automatic outlier filtering without requiring data quality labels. For nonlinear systems, we extend the framework through a two-stage online selection approach accelerated by the LiSSA algorithm.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Trajectory Bundle Method for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing demands precise tension and velocity control under strict operational constraints. Model predictive control requires gradient computation, while sampling-based methods such as MPPI struggle with hard constraint satisfaction. This paper presents an adaptive trajectory bundle method that achieves rigorous constraint handling through derivative-free sequential convex programming. The approach approximates nonlinear dynamics and costs via interpolated sample bundles, with adaptive trust regions and penalty parameters ensuring robust convergence without manual tuning. Simulations on a six-zone R2R system demonstrate tracking accuracy comparable to gradient-based MPC with superior constraint satisfaction over sampling-based alternatives.</description>

      <title>Open-source implementation of distribution network reconfiguration methods: Analysis and comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical and practical approach to the evolution of distribution network reconfiguration algorithms, tracing their development from foundational heuristic methods introduced in 1975 to contemporary state-of-the-art techniques. The article systematically reviews seven different methodologies, including classical heuristic algorithms (Merlin, Baran, and others), advanced meta-heuristic methodologies (particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms), and purely mathematical approaches (MILP-based), analyzing their theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, computational complexity, and performance metrics based on extensive literature review and our own empirical testing. Each methodology is assessed through standardized test systems, considering multiple objectives such as power loss minimization and voltage profile improvement. The comparative analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of each approach under various network conditions and operational constraints. Furthermore, this work provides significant value to the research community by offering an open-source repository containing documented implementations of all reviewed algorithms. This resource facilitates accessibility for newcomers to the field, promotes reproducible research, and accelerates the development of next-generation distribution network optimization solutions. The repository includes comprehensive documentation, test cases, and performance benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An LLM-Assisted Multi-Agent Control Framework for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roll-to-roll manufacturing requires precise tension and velocity control to ensure product quality, yet controller commissioning and adaptation remain time-intensive processes dependent on expert knowledge. This paper presents an LLM-assisted multi-agent framework that automates control system design and adaptation for R2R systems while maintaining safety. The framework operates through five phases: system identification from operational data, automated controller selection and tuning, sim-to-real adaptation with safety verification, continuous monitoring with diagnostic capabilities, and periodic model refinement. Experimental validation on a R2R system demonstrates successful tension regulation and velocity tracking under significant model uncertainty, with the framework achieving performance convergence through iterative adaptation. The approach reduces manual tuning effort while providing transparent diagnostic information for maintenance planning, offering a practical pathway for integrating AI-assisted automation in manufacturing control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water community. This competition will be hosted at the 4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026. This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: "Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems."
  The objective is to design and operate a water distribution system over a long-term horizon under deep uncertainty, with interventions applied in stages. For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence. The solutions will be assessed using a transparent and inspectable open-source evaluation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying contractive Lur'e-type systems. Specifically, it proposes an identification framework that integrates linear prior knowledge with a kernel representation of the nonlinear feedback while systematically enforcing contractivity via Lipschitz constant design. The resulting algorithms provide models that are accurate in prediction, interpretable, and faithful to the contractive nature of the true system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that enforcing contractivity significantly improves parameter estimation and yields models that are both accurate and physically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Control Law for Low Thrust Orbit Transfer with Guaranteed Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric propulsion is used to maximize payload capacity in communication satellites. These orbit raising maneuvers span several months and hundreds of revolutions, making trajectory design a complex challenge. The literature typically addresses this problem using feedback laws, with Q-law being one of the most prominent approaches. However, Q-law suffers from closed-loop stability issues, limiting its suitability for real-time on-board implementation. In this work, we focus on closed-loop orbit raising rather than offline trajectory planning and address the stability limitations of the Q-law through a Lyapunov based control design. A Lyapunov-guided modification of the classical Q-law is proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and enable real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through closed-loop orbit transfers across various scenarios, including co-planar transfers, equatorial to polar orbit transfers, and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary earth orbit (GEO) transfers.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function for Unknown Systems: An Approximation-free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prescribed-time reach-avoid (PT-RA) control problem for nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics operating in environments with moving obstacles. Unlike robust or learning based Control Barrier Function (CBF) methods, the proposed framework requires neither online model learning nor uncertainty bound estimation. A CBF-based Quadratic Program (CBF-QP) is solved on a simple virtual system to generate a safe reference satisfying PT-RA conditions with respect to time-varying, tightened obstacle and goal sets. The true system is confined to a Virtual Confinement Zone (VCZ) around this reference using an approximation-free feedback law. This construction guarantees real-time safety and prescribed-time target reachability under unknown dynamics and dynamic constraints without explicit model identification or offline precomputation. Simulation results illustrate reliable dynamic obstacle avoidance and timely convergence to the target set.</description>

      <title>Resistant Topology Inference in Consensus Networks: A Feedback-Based Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus networks are widely deployed in numerous civil and industrial applications. However, the process of reaching a common consensus among nodes can unintentionally reveal the network's topology to external observers by appropriate inference techniques. This paper investigates a feedback-based resistant inference design to prevent the topology from being inferred using data, while preserving the original consensus convergence. First, we characterize the conditions to preserve the original consensus, and introduce the ''accurate inference'' notion, which accounts for both the uniqueness of the solution to topology inference (solvability) and the deviation from the original topology (accuracy). Then, we employ invariant subspace analysis to characterize the solvability. Even when unique inference remains possible, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback design to induce inaccurate inference, and give a Laplacian structure based distributed design. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Scalable Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Accelerating Electromagnetic Transient Stability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper puts forward a framework to accelerate Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations by replacing individual components with trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). EMT simulations are considered the cornerstone of transient stability assessment of power systems with high shares of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), and, although accurate, they are notorious for their slow simulation speed. Taking a deeper dive into the EMT simulation algorithms, this paper identifies the most computationally expensive components of the simulation and replaces them with fast and accurate PINNs. The proposed novel PINN formulation enables a modular and scalable integration into the simulation algorithm. Using a type-4 wind turbine EMT model, we demonstrate a 4--6x simulation speedup by capturing the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a PINN. We validate all our results with PSCAD software.</description>

      <title>Development of a Load Profile Generator for Non-road Mobile Machinery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a Load Profile Generator model for non-road mobile machinery, which depicts the most common operational profiles that reflect real-world conditions. This technological bottom-up model enables users to parameterize specific machines for simulation and observe their power demand at the actuator interfaces. The application of the Load Profile Generator covers different non-road mobile machinery categories, such as construction, agriculture, industrial and forestry. In this study, the Load Profile Generator was used to demonstrate common operations of material handler and forest forwarder, which have been validated against real-world data to match the results. The usage of Load Profile Generator aids engineers in evaluation machines performance by developing operation strategies. It opens doors to further systems analysis as it can serve as an interface for energy demand calculations. The model's results are accurate enough to provide a sufficient understanding of a wide range of non-road mobile machinery load profiles as well as insights about alternative fuel and power supply concepts helping in optimising the system simulation.</description>

      <title>Targeted-Subharmonic-Eliminating Pulse Density Modulation for Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a targeted-subharmonic-eliminating pulse density modulation (PDM) method for series-series (SS) compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The subharmonic frequency components which excite current abnormal oscillations in PDM controlled WPT systems are eliminated through a specially designed noise transfer function (NTF). The proposed method is simple to implement in both primary and secondary sides of WPT systems and exhibits a certain tolerance to deviations caused by inaccurate coupling coefficient identification in NTF design. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in suppressing current abnormal oscillations and reducing the fluctuations in current amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Reachability Verification with Probabilistic Guarantees under Koopman Spectral Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing rigorous reachability guarantees for unknown complex systems is a crucial and challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging Koopman operator theory. Instead of operating in the state space, the proposed method encodes model uncertainty from finite data directly into Koopman spectral representation with quantifiable error bounds. Leveraging this spectral information, we systematically determine time intervals within which trajectories from the initial set are guaranteed, with a prescribed probability, to reach the target set. This enables the rigorous reachability verification without explicit computation of reachable sets, thereby offering a significant advantage in scalability and applicability. We finally validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through case studies on representative dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Power Allocation For NOMA-Based Transmission in 6G Optical Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OWC has been considered as a key enabling technology to unlock unprecedented speeds of communication, supporting high demands of data traffic. In this paper, infrared lasers are used as optical transmitters operating in an indoor environment under eye safety regulations due to their high modulation speed. To provide efficient multiple access service, NOMA-based transmission is implemented to multiplex messages intended to multiple users in the power domain and maximize the spectral efficiency of our laser-based OWC network. In particular, a BIA outer precoder is designed to coordinate the transmission among multiple APs and determine the precoding matrices for groups of users potential formed according to NOMA principles. For effective use of NOMA, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the network through forming optimum groups under certain joint conditions, efficient power allocation, high quality of service for each weak and strong users, and high overall system performance. Such optimization problems are defined as max-min fractional programs difficult to solve in practice. Therefore, a dynamic application for NOMA is introduced using two algorithms. First, a RF-aided dynamic algorithm is designed to form multiple groups, where users exchange binary variables among them through an RF system to establish distance-based weight edges, which are used as a metric for the grouping process. Second, a dynamic power allocation is proposed to determine the optimum power allocated to each group, while the users belonging to a certain group receive their traffic demands regardless of their classification as weak or strong. The results show the convergence of the proposed dynamic application to the optimum solution, and its high performance in terms of sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency compared to counterpart schemes.</description>

      <title>Strong nonlinear detectability and moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems with unknown inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers state estimation for general nonlinear discrete-time systems subject to measurement noise and possibly unbounded unknown inputs. To approach this problem, we first propose the concept of strong nonlinear detectability. This condition is sufficient and necessary for the existence of unknown input state estimators (UISEs), which reconstruct states from noisy sampled measurements and yield bounded estimation error even for unbounded unknown inputs. Based on the proposed detectability notion, a UISE is designed via a moving horizon estimation strategy using a full-order model as well as past and current measurements. Next, we tighten this detectability notion to design a two-stage MHE-based UISE, which is computationally more efficient than the MHE-based UISE using full-order models. In a simulation example with a plant growth process, both variants of MHE-based UISEs are compared with a conventional MHE to illustrate the merits of the developed methods.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov-Based Small-Gain Theorem for Fixed-Time Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Lyapunov-based small-gain methodology for establishing fixed-time stability (FxTS) guarantees in interconnected dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider interconnections in which each subsystem admits an individual fixed-time input-to-state stability (ISS) Lyapunov function that certifies FxT-ISS. We then show that if a nonlinear small-gain condition is satisfied, then the entire interconnected system is FxTS. Our results are analogous to existing Lyapunov-based small-gain theorems developed for asymptotic and finite-time stability, thereby filling an important gap in the stability analysis of interconnected dynamical systems. The proposed theoretical tools are further illustrated through analytical and numerical examples, including an application to fixed-time feedback optimization of dynamical systems without time-scale separation between the plant and the controller.</description>

      <title>Secure Command, Control and Communications Systems (C3) for Army UxVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) are increasingly used in modern military operations for reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike missions, enhancing situational awareness while reducing risk to personnel. Their affordability and rapid deployment have encouraged the adoption of commercial solutions. However, many rely on insecure protocols such as MAVLink, which lack authentication and encryption mechanisms. This paper designed, implemented, and evaluated a new secure command-and-control architecture that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) while supporting real-time control delegation between Ground Control Stations (GCSs). The proposed solution, named New Command and Control System (NC2S), enforces a zero-trust model integrating hierarchical credential-based privileges to regulate access and control among Tactical Commanders (TC), GCSs, and UxVs. It employs mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, while message integrity is ensured through Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). Multiple lightweight protocols were developed for credential management, key renewal, and control handover. The NC2S prototype was experimentally validated over Wi-Fi and Rohde&amp;Schwarz HR-5000H tactical radios. Results showed that HR-5000H links introduce latencies roughly two orders of magnitude higher than broadband technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi or 5G&amp;Beyond technologies) but are still able to maintain stable communication with minimal message loss, making them suitable for the NC2S links among TC terminals and GCSs.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Sea State and Vessel Parameters Using a Mass-Spring-Damper Equivalence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time sea state estimation is vital for applications like shipbuilding and maritime safety. Traditional methods rely on accurate wave-vessel transfer functions to estimate wave spectra from onboard sensors. In contrast, our approach jointly estimates sea state and vessel parameters without needing prior transfer function knowledge, which may be unavailable or variable. We model the wave-vessel system using pseudo mass-spring-dampers and develop a dynamic model for the system. This method allows for recursive modeling of wave excitation as a time-varying input, relaxing prior works' assumption of a constant input. We derive statistically consistent process noise covariance and implement a square root cubature Kalman filter for sensor data fusion. Further, we derive the Posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound to evaluate estimator performance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and data from a high-fidelity validated simulator confirm that the estimated wave spectrum matches methods assuming complete transfer function knowledge.</description>

      <title>SwordRiding: A Unified Navigation Framework for Quadrotors in Unknown Complex Environments via Online Guiding Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although quadrotor navigation has achieved high performance in trajectory planning and control, real-time adaptability in unknown complex environments remains a core challenge. This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Path Planning in Navier-Stokes Flow with POD-Based Reduced-Order Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for optimal trajectory generation in flow-driven systems governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, combining a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) reduced0order model (ROM) with Model Predictive Control (MPC). The approach (i) approximates the velocity field from data via snapshot POD and orthogonal projection, (ii) derives a Galerkin-projected dynamical model in reduced coordinates, and (iii) employs MPC to plan control inputs that steer an agent through the predicted flow while satisfying state and actuation constraints. By leveraging reduced-order modeling, the method enables real-time control in high-dimensional flow environments. Simulations demonstrate accurate flow-field reconstruction and efficient trajectory generation within realistic wind environments.</description>

      <title>SemOD: Semantic Enabled Object Detection Network under Various Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

      <title>Nonholonomic Narrow Dead-End Escape with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonholonomic constraints restrict feasible velocities without reducing configuration-space dimension, which makes collision-free geometric paths generally non-executable for car-like robots. Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits. We provide our project as open source at https://github.com/gitagitty/cisDRL-RobotNav.git</description>

      <title>Test Time Training for AC Power Flow Surrogates via Physics and Operational Constraint Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Stochastic Action-Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Truncated Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), it is often advantageous to consider additional constraints on the action space to ensure safety or action relevance. Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to accomplish a sit-to-stand (STS) motion is key to increase functional mobility and reduce rehospitalization risks. While raising aid (transfer) devices and partial bodyweight support (rehabilitation) devices exist, both are unable to adjust the STS training to different mobility levels. Therefore, We have developed an STS training device that allows various configurations of impedance and vertical/forward forces to adapt to many training needs while maintaining commercial raising aid transfer capabilities. Experiments with healthy adults (both men and women) of various heights and weights show that the device 1) has a low impact on the natural STS kinematics, 2) can provide precise weight unloading at the patient's center of mass and 3) can add a forward virtual spring to assist the transfer of the bodyweight to the feet for seat-off, at the start of the STS motion.</description>

      <title>Can industrial overcapacity enable seasonal flexibility in electricity use? A case study of aluminum smelting in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many countries, declining demand in energy-intensive industries (EIIs) such as cement, steel, and aluminum is leading to industrial overcapacity. Although overcapacity is traditionally seen as problematic, it could unlock EIIs' flexibility in electricity use. Using China's aluminum smelting sector as a case, we evaluate the system-level cost-benefit of retaining EII overcapacity for flexible electricity use in decarbonized systems. We find that overcapacity enables smelters to adopt a seasonal operation paradigm, ceasing production during winter load peaks driven by heating electrification and renewable seasonality. In a 2050-net-zero scenario, this paradigm reduces China's electricity-system investment and operating costs by 15-72 billion CNY per year (8-34% of the industry's product value), enough to offset the costs of maintaining overcapacity and product storage. Seasonal operation also cuts workforce fluctuations across aluminum smelting and thermal-power sectors by up to 62%, potentially mitigating socio-economic disruptions from industrial restructuring and the energy transition.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Laser Dicing Processes with Bayesian Optimization for Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser dicing of semiconductor wafers is a critical step in microelectronic manufacturing, where multiple sequential laser passes precisely separate individual dies from the wafer. Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Motor Condition Monitoring with Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor condition monitoring is essential for ensuring system reliability and preventing catastrophic failures. However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1\% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22\%, reaching 90\% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant MARL for CAVs under Observation Perturbations for Highway On-Ramp Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.</description>

      <title>Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12665v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal operation of transportation systems is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic accidents and social events. Many established control strategies reliant on mathematical models can struggle with real-world disruptions, leading to significant divergence from their anticipated efficiency. This work fuses the cutting-edge concept of antifragility into the design of a learning-based traffic control strategy for large-scale urban road networks to perform against disruptions. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness, resilience, and reliability as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also to thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Incorporating antifragile modules composed of traffic state derivatives and redundancy, a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed and subsequently evaluated in a two-region cordon-shaped urban traffic perimeter network, and a numerical case study based on real-world data. Promising results highlight (1) the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods under incremental magnitude of disruptions, (2) distribution skewness as the antifragility indicator demonstrating its relative antifragility, (3) its effectiveness under limited observability due to real-world data availability constraints, and (4) robustness of the proposed antifragile module when embedded into advanced RL algorithms for superior performance. The proposed antifragile methodology is generalizable and holds potential for applications beyond perimeter control, offering integration into systems exposed to disruptions across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Open-/Closed-loop Active Learning for Data-driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important question in data-driven control is how to obtain an informative dataset. In this work, we consider the problem of effective data acquisition of an unknown linear system with bounded disturbance for both open-loop and closed-loop stages. The learning objective is to minimize the volume of the set of admissible systems. First, a performance measure based on historical data and the input sequence is introduced to characterize the upper bound of the volume of the set of admissible systems. On the basis of this performance measure, an open-loop active learning strategy is proposed to minimize the volume by actively designing inputs during the open-loop stage. For the closed-loop stage, a closed-loop active learning strategy is designed to select and learn from informative closed-loop data. The efficiency of the proposed closed-loop active learning strategy is proved by showing that the unselected data cannot benefit the learning performance. Furthermore, an adaptive predictive controller is designed in accordance with the proposed data acquisition approach. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the controller are proved by analyzing the effect of the closed-loop active learning strategy. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed data acquisition strategy.</description>

      <title>Time-to-reach Bounds for Verification of Dynamical Systems Using the Koopman Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel Koopman spectrum-based reachability verification method for nonlinear systems. Contrary to conventional methods that focus on characterizing all potential states of a dynamical system over a presupposed time span, our approach seeks to verify the reachability by assessing the non-emptiness of estimated time-to-reach intervals without engaging in the explicit computation of reachable set. Based on the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, we reformulate the problem of verifying existence of reachable trajectories into the problem of determining feasible time-to-reach bounds required for system reachability. By solving linear programming (LP) problems, our algorithm can effectively estimate all potential time intervals during which a dynamical system can enter (and exit) target sets from given initial sets over an unbounded time horizon. Finally, we demonstrate our method in challenging settings, such as verifying the reachability between non-convex or even disconnected sets, as well as backward reachability and multiple entries into target sets. Additionally, we validate its applicability in addressing real-world challenges and scalability to high-dimensional systems through case studies in verifying the reachability of the cart-pole and multi-agent consensus systems.</description>

      <title>L4acados: Learning-based models for acados, applied to Gaussian process-based predictive control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating learning-based models, such as artificial neural networks or Gaussian processes, into model predictive control (MPC) strategies can significantly improve control performance and online adaptation capabilities for real-world applications. Still, enabling state-of-the-art implementations of learning-based models for MPC is complicated by the challenge of interfacing machine learning frameworks with real-time optimal control software. This work aims at filling this gap by incorporating external sensitivities in sequential quadratic programming solvers for nonlinear optimal control. To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based dynamics models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16797v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a meta-learning-based Koopman modeling and predictive control approach for nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties. An adaptive deep meta-learning-based modeling approach, called Meta Adaptive Koopman Operator (MAKO), is proposed. Without knowledge of the parametric uncertainty, the proposed MAKO approach can learn a meta-model from a multi-modal dataset and efficiently adapt to new systems with previously unseen parameter settings by using online data. Based on the learned meta Koopman model, a predictive control scheme is developed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured even in the presence of previously unseen parameter settings. Through extensive simulations, our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in both modeling accuracy and control efficacy as compared to competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Switching Model Predictive Control Meets Koopman Operator for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Koopman-enhanced distributed switched model predictive control (SMPC) framework for safe and scalable navigation of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments with moving obstacles. The proposed method integrates switched motion modes and data-driven prediction to enable real-time, collision-free coordination. A localized Koopman operator approximates nonlinear obstacle dynamics as linear models based on online measurements, enabling accurate trajectory forecasting. These predictions are embedded into a distributed SMPC structure, where each UAV makes autonomous decisions using local and cluster-based information. This computationally efficient architecture is particularly promising for applications in surface transportation, including coordinated vehicle flows, shared infrastructure with pedestrians or cyclists, and urban UAV traffic. Simulation results demonstrate reliable formation control and real-time obstacle avoidance, highlighting the frameworks broad relevance for intelligent and cooperative mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity and L2 Stability of Large-Scale Networks with Changing Interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the L2 stability of switched networks is studied based on the QSR-dissipativity of each agent. While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.</description>

      <title>A K-means Inspired Solution Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Traveling Salesman Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) is a commonly used mathematical model for multi-agent task allocation. However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.</description>

      <title>Design and Measurements of mmWave FMCW Radar Based Non-Contact Multi-Patient Heart Rate and Breath Rate Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show &gt;97% and &gt;93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.</description>

      <title>Multi-Hypotheses Navigation in Collaborative Localization subject to Cyber Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses resilient collaborative localization in multi-agent systems exposed to spoofed radio frequency measurements. Each agent maintains multiple hypotheses of its own state and exchanges selected information with neighbors using covariance intersection. Geometric reductions based on distance tests and convex hull structure limit the number of hypotheses transmitted, controlling the spread of hypotheses through the network. The method enables agents to separate spoofed and truthful measurements and to recover consistent estimates once the correct hypothesis is identified. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the approach to contain the effect of adversarial measurements, while also highlighting the impact of conservative fusion on detection speed. The framework provides a foundation for resilient multi-agent navigation and can be extended with coordinated hypothesis selection across the network.</description>

      <title>Safe Multi-Robotic Arm Interaction via 3D Convex Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) constructed for safe interactions among 3D convex shapes to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms. The project video is available at this link.</description>

      <title>Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses path planning and task allocation in multi-robot systems subject to global Boolean specifications defined on the final state. The main contribution is the exploitation of the structural properties of a Petri net model: we prove that the associated constraint matrix is totally unimodular (TU). This property allows relaxing the original Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) in which all variables are continuous except for those that are corresponding to the atomic propositions in the Boolean specification. This yields a substantial reduction in complexity. In the special case where the specification is a conjunction of atomic propositions of cardinality equal to the team size, i.e., the standard Task-Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) problem, the formulation reduces to a Linear Programming (LP). Collision-free paths are ensured by introducing intermediate synchronization points only when necessary, while robots move in parallel between them. These structural insights enable a computationally efficient and scalable solution, achieving tractability and safety for large-scale systems with up to 2500 robots.</description>

      <title>MuFlex: A Scalable, Physics-based Platform for Multi-Building Flexibility Analysis and Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistanc-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform's capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. The results show that under four buildings' coordination, SAC effectively reduced the aggregated peak demand by nearly 12% with maintained indoor comfort to ensure the power demand below the threshold. The platform is released open-source on GitHub: https://github.com/BuildNexusX/MuFlex.</description>

      <title>Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</description>

      <title>MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance</description>
