      <title>From Ideal Membership Problem for polynomial rings to Dehn Functions of Metabelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal membership problem asks whether an element in the ring belongs to the given ideal. In this paper, we propose a function that reflecting the complexity of the ideal membership problem in the ring of Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients. We also connect the complexity function we define to the Dehn function of a metabelian group, in the hope of constructing a metabelian group with superexponential Dehn function.</description>

      <title>On soluble groups in which commutators have prime power order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article deals with finite groups in which commutators have prime power order (CPPO-groups). We show that if G is a soluble CPPO-group, then the order of the commutator subgroup G' is divisible by at most two primes.</description>

      <title>The density of orders of quotients of triangle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper it is shown that for the natural density (among the positive integers) of the orders of the finite quotients of every ordinary triangle group is zero, using a modification of a component of a 1976 theorem of Bertram on large cyclic subgroups of finite groups, and the Turan-Kubilius inequality from asymptotic number theory. This answers a challenging question raised by Tucker, based on some work for special cases by May and Zimmerman and himself.</description>

      <title>Jacobi polynomials, invariant rings, and generalized $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we provide results that relate the Jacobi polynomials in genus $g$. We show that if a code is $t$-homogeneous that is, the codewords of the code for every given weight hold a $t$-design, then its Jacobi polynomial in genus $g$ with composition $T$ with $|T|\leq t$ can be obtained from its weight enumerator in genus~$g$ using the polarization operator. Using this fact, we investigate the invariant ring, which relates the homogeneous Jacobi polynomials of the binary codes in genus $g$. Specifically, the generators of the invariant ring appearing for $g=1$ are obtained. Moreover, we define the split Jacobi polynomials in genus~$g$ and obtain the MacWilliams type identity for it. A split generalization for higher genus cases of the relation between the Jacobi polynomials and weight enumerator of a $t$-homogeneous code also given.</description>

      <title>The centre of a finitely generated strongly verbally closed group is almost always pure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06837v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assertion in the title implies that many interesting groups (e.g., all non-abelian braid groups or ${\bf SL}_{100}(\mathbb Z)$) are not strongly verbally closed, i.e., they embed into some finitely generated groups as verbally closed subgroups, which are not retracts.</description>

      <title>Quantitative characterization of finite simple groups: a complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06362v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the work on the characterization of finite simple groups and the study on finite groups with the set of element orders and two orders (the order of group and the set of element orders). Some related topics, and the applications together with their generalizations are also discussed. The original version of this article was published in Chinese in the journal Scientia Sinica Mathematica, no.53(2023), pp.931-952. This revised and expanded version has corrected several errors and added quite a few contents. Especially, it is pointed that this work has applications in mathematics and computational complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Straightening Banach-Lie-group-valued almost-cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact group $\mathbb{G}$ acting continuously on a Banach Lie group $\mathbb{U}$, we prove that maps $\mathbb{G}\to \mathbb{U}$ close to being 1-cocycles for the action can be deformed analytically into actual 1-cocycles. This recovers Hyers-Ulam stability results of Grove-Karcher-Ruh (trivial $\mathbb{G}$-action, compact Lie $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{U}$) and de la Harpe-Karoubi (trivial $\mathbb{G}$-action, $\mathbb{U}:=$invertible elements of a Banach algebra). The obvious analogues for higher cocycles also hold for abelian $\mathbb{U}$.</description>

      <title>From letter-quasimorphisms to angle structures and spectral gaps for scl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new geometric proof of a theorem of Heuer showing that, in the presence of letter-quasimorphisms (which are analogues of real-valued quasimorphisms with image in free groups), and in particular in RAAGs, there is a sharp lower bound of 1/2 for stable commutator length. Our approach is to show that letter-quasimorphisms give rise to negatively curved angle structures on admissible surfaces. This generalises Duncan and Howie's proof of the 1/2-lower bound in free groups, and can also be seen as a version of Bavard duality for letter-quasimorphisms.</description>

      <title>Orbit-blocking words and the average-case complexity of Whitehead's problem in the free group of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let F_2 denote the free group of rank 2. Our main technical result of independent interest is: for any element u of F_2, there is g in F_2 such that no cyclically reduced image of u under an automorphism of F_2 contains g as a subword. We then address computational complexity of the following version of the Whitehead automorphism problem: given a fixed u in F_2, decide, on an input v in F_2 of length n, whether or not v is an automorphic image of u. We show that there is an algorithm that solves this problem and has constant (i.e., independent of n) average-case complexity.</description>

      <title>Coarse entropy of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.15172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse geometry studies metric spaces on the large scale. The recently introduced notion of coarse entropy is a tool to study dynamics from the coarse point of view. We prove that all isometries of a given metric space have the same coarse entropy and that this value is a coarse invariant. We call this value the coarse entropy of the space and investigate its connections with other properties of the space. We prove that it can only be either zero or infinity, and although for many spaces this dichotomy coincides with the subexponential--exponential growth dichotomy, there is no relation between coarse entropy and volume growth more generally. We completely characterise this dichotomy for spaces with bounded geometry and for quasi-geodesic spaces. As an application, we provide an example where coarse entropy yields an obstruction for a coarse embedding, where such an embedding is not precluded by considerations of volume growth.</description>

      <title>Order types of reflection orders on affine Weyl groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the order types of reflection orders on irreducible affine Weyl groups. We show that they are intimately related to the Catalan combinatorics. We explicitly describe all of those order types and show that these order types can be parameterized by deformed Dyck words, which can be enumerated by Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Pythagorean representations of R. Thompson's groups and of the Cuntz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Pythagorean dimension: a natural number (or infinity) for all representations of the Cuntz algebra and certain unitary representations of the Richard Thompson groups called Pythagorean. For each natural number d we completely classify (in a functorial manner) all such representations using finite dimensional linear algebra. Their irreducible classes form a real manifold of dimension $2d^2+1$ playing the role of a moduli space. Apart from a finite disjoint union of circles, each point of the manifold corresponds to an irreducible unitary representation of Thompson's group F (which extends to the other Thompson groups and the Cuntz algebra) that is not monomial. The remaining circles provide monomial representations which we previously fully described and classified. We translate in our language a large number of previous results in the literature. We explain how our techniques extend them.</description>
