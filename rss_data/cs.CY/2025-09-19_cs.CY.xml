      <title>Modeling User Redemption Behavior in Complex Incentive Digital Environment: An Empirical Study Using Large-Scale Transactional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital economy implements complex incentive systems to retain users through point redemption. Understanding user behavior in such complex incentive structures presents a fundamental challenge, especially in estimating the value of these digital assets against traditional money. This study tackles this question by analyzing large-scale, real-world transaction data from a popular personal finance application that captures both monetary spending and point-based transactions across Japan's deeply integrated loyalty networks. We find that point usage is not random but is systematically linked to demographics, with older users tending to convert points into financial assets. Furthermore, our analysis using a natural experiment and a causal inference technique reveals that a large point grant stimulated an increase in point spending without affecting cash expenditure. We also find that consumers' shopping styles are associated with their point redemption patterns. This study, conducted within a massive real-world economic ecosystem, examines how consumers navigate multi-currency environments, with direct implications for modeling economic behavior and designing digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence as a Strategic Growth Catalyst for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept reserved for large corporations to a present-day, accessible, and essential growth lever for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). For entrepreneurs and business leaders, strategic AI adoption is no longer an option but an imperative for competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term survival. This report provides a comprehensive framework for SME leaders to navigate this technological shift, offering the foundational knowledge, business case, practical applications, and strategic guidance necessary to harness the power of AI. The quantitative evidence supporting AI adoption is compelling; 91% of SMEs using AI report that it directly boosts their revenue. Beyond top-line growth, AI drives profound operational efficiencies, with studies showing it can reduce operational costs by up to 30% and save businesses more than 20 hours of valuable time each month. This transformation is occurring within the context of a seismic economic shift; the global AI market is projected to surge from $233.46 Billion in 2024 to an astonishing $1.77 Trillion by 2032. This paper demystifies the core concepts of AI, presents a business case based on market data, details practical applications, and lays out a phased, actionable adoption strategy.</description>

      <title>Generative Large Language Models for Knowledge Representation: A Systematic Review of Concept Map Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of generative large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for automating knowledge representation through concept maps, a long-standing pedagogical tool valued for fostering meaningful learning and higher-order thinking. Traditional construction of concept maps is labor-intensive, requiring significant expertise and time, limiting their scalability in education. This review systematically synthesizes the emerging body of research on LLM-enabled concept map generation, focusing on two guiding questions: (a) What methods and technical features of LLMs are employed to construct concept maps? (b) What empirical evidence exists to validate their educational utility? Through a comprehensive search across major databases and AI-in-education conference proceedings, 28 studies meeting rigorous inclusion criteria were analyzed using thematic synthesis. Findings reveal six major methodological categories: human-in-the-loop systems, weakly supervised learning models, fine-tuned domain-specific LLMs, pre-trained LLMs with prompt engineering, hybrid systems integrating knowledge bases, and modular frameworks combining symbolic and statistical tools. Validation strategies ranged from quantitative metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, semantic similarity) to qualitative evaluations (expert review, learner feedback). Results indicate LLM-generated maps hold promise for scalable, adaptive, and pedagogically relevant knowledge visualization, though challenges remain regarding validity, interpretability, multilingual adaptability, and classroom integration. Future research should prioritize interdisciplinary co-design, empirical classroom trials, and alignment with instructional practices to realize their full educational potential.</description>

      <title>OnlineMate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Companion System for Cognitive Support in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Market Entrant Game Developers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for generating digital assets, such as programming codes and images. Games composed of various digital assets are thus expected to be influenced significantly by AI. Leveraging public data and AI disclosure statements of games, this paper shows that relatively more independent developers entered the market when generative AI became more publicly accessible, but their purposes of using AI are similar with non-independent developers. Game features associated with AI hint nuanced impacts of AI on independent developers.</description>

      <title>Prestige over merit: An adapted audit of LLM bias in peer review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly integral, though largely informal, role in scholarly peer review. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs reproduce the biases observed in human decision-making. We adapt a resume-style audit to scientific publishing, developing a multi-role LLM simulation (editor/reviewer) that evaluates a representative set of high-quality manuscripts across the physical, biological, and social sciences under randomized author identities (institutional prestige, gender, race). The audit reveals a strong and consistent institutional-prestige bias: identical papers attributed to low-prestige affiliations face a significantly higher risk of rejection, despite only modest differences in LLM-assessed quality. To probe mechanisms, we generate synthetic CVs for the same author profiles; these encode large prestige-linked disparities and an inverted prestige-tenure gradient relative to national benchmarks. The results suggest that both domain norms and prestige-linked priors embedded in training data shape paper-level outcomes once identity is visible, converting affiliation into a decisive status cue.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Urban Policy-Intelligence: Recovering Legacy Effects of Redlining with a Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows how a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can expand urban measurement capacity and support tracking of place-based policy interventions. Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.</description>

      <title>DetectAnyLLM: Towards Generalizable and Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Text Across Domains and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent attention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However, existing approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot detectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while training-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training data, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of training-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective and task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL), a novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with task-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core semantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and generalization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection framework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs. To ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse multi-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora across 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17 cutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual styles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing methods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently outperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same training data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our DDL.

      <title>Investigating the Ways in Which Mobile Phone Images with Open-Source Data Can Be Used to Create an Augmented Virtual Environment (AVE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of an interactive system for constructing Augmented Virtual Environments (AVEs) by fusing mobile phone images with open-source geospatial data. By integrating 2D image data with 3D models derived from sources such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Digital Terrain Models (DTM), the proposed system generates immersive environments that enhance situational context. The system leverages Python for data processing and Unity for 3D visualization, interconnected via UDP-based two-way communication. Preliminary user evaluation demonstrates that the resulting AVEs accurately represent real-world scenes and improve users' contextual understanding. Key challenges addressed include projector calibration, precise model construction from heterogeneous data, and object detection for dynamic scene representation.</description>

      <title>Nudging the Somas: Exploring How Live-Configurable Mixed Reality Objects Shape Open-Ended Intercorporeal Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) experiences increasingly explore how virtual elements can shape physical behaviour, yet how MR objects guide group movement remains underexplored. We address this gap by examining how virtual objects can nudge collective, co-located movement without relying on explicit instructions or choreography. We developed GravField, a co-located MR performance system where an "object jockey" live-configures virtual objects, springs, ropes, magnets, with real-time, parameterised "digital physics" (e.g., weight, elasticity, force) to influence the movement of headset-wearing participants. These properties were made perceptible through augmented visual and audio feedback, creating dynamic cognitive-somatic cues. Our analysis of the performances, based on video, interviews, soma trajectories, and field notes, indicates that these live nudges support emergent intercorporeal coordination and that ambiguity and real-time configuration sustain open-ended, exploratory engagement. Ultimately, our work offers empirical insights and design principles for MR systems that can guide group movement through embodied, felt dynamics.</description>

      <title>From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) - A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear, mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical, five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5 AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated, higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research community.</description>

      <title>Can I Trust This Chatbot? Assessing User Privacy in AI-Healthcare Chatbot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into everyday life, AI-powered chatbot mobile applications are increasingly adopted across industries, particularly in the healthcare domain. These chatbots offer accessible and 24/7 support, yet their collection and processing of sensitive health data present critical privacy concerns. While prior research has examined chatbot security, privacy issues specific to AI healthcare chatbots have received limited attention. Our study evaluates the privacy practices of 12 widely downloaded AI healthcare chatbot apps available on the App Store and Google Play in the United States. We conducted a three-step assessment analyzing: (1) privacy settings during sign-up, (2) in-app privacy controls, and (3) the content of privacy policies. The analysis identified significant gaps in user data protection. Our findings reveal that half of the examined apps did not present a privacy policy during sign up, and only two provided an option to disable data sharing at that stage. The majority of apps' privacy policies failed to address data protection measures. Moreover, users had minimal control over their personal data. The study provides key insights for information science researchers, developers, and policymakers to improve privacy protections in AI healthcare chatbot apps.</description>

      <title>From Sea to System: Exploring User-Centered Explainable AI for Maritime Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous technologies increasingly shape maritime operations, understanding why an AI system makes a decision becomes as crucial as what it decides. In complex and dynamic maritime environments, trust in AI depends not only on performance but also on transparency and interpretability. This paper highlights the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) as a foundation for effective human-machine teaming in the maritime domain, where informed oversight and shared understanding are essential. To support the user-centered integration of XAI, we propose a domain-specific survey designed to capture maritime professionals' perceptions of trust, usability, and explainability. Our aim is to foster awareness and guide the development of user-centric XAI systems tailored to the needs of seafarers and maritime teams.</description>

      <title>Balanced Spanning Tree Distributions Have Separation Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based methods such as ReCom are widely used to audit redistricting plans for fairness, with the balanced spanning tree distribution playing a central role since it favors compact, contiguous, and population-balanced districts. However, whether such samples are truly representative or exhibit hidden biases remains an open question. In this work, we introduce the notion of separation fairness, which asks whether adjacent geographic units are separated with at most a constant probability (bounded away from one) in sampled redistricting plans. Focusing on grid graphs and two-district partitions, we prove that a smooth variant of the balanced spanning tree distribution satisfies separation fairness. Our results also provide theoretical support for popular MCMC methods like ReCom, suggesting that they maintain fairness at a granular level in the sampling process. Along the way, we develop tools for analyzing loop-erased random walks and partitions that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Assessing Historical Structural Oppression Worldwide via Rule-Guided Prompting of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15216</link>

Abstract: Traditional efforts to measure historical structural oppression struggle with cross-national validity due to the unique, locally specified histories of exclusion, colonization, and social status in each country, and often have relied on structured indices that privilege material resources while overlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. We introduce a novel framework for oppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse geopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances from a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting strategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically grounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based historical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary measurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a scalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in data-driven research and public health contexts. To support reproducible evaluation, we release an open-sourced benchmark dataset for assessing LLMs on oppression measurement (https://github.com/chattergpt/llm-oppression-benchmark).</description>

      <title>Deciding how to respond: A deliberative framework to guide policymaker responses to AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discourse on responsible artificial intelligence (AI) regulation is understandably dominated by risk-focused assessments and analyses. This approach reflects the fundamental uncertainty policymakers face when determining appropriate responses to current, emerging and novel AI systems. In this article, we argue that by operationalising the concept of freedom - the philosophical counterpart to responsibility - a complementary approach centred on the potential societal benefits of AI systems can be developed. The result is a discursive framework grounded in freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity, which represent the two main intellectual traditions of interpreting freedom. We contend that the complexity, ambiguity and contestation involved in regulating AI systems make a deliberative paradigm more useful than the conventional technical one. The resulting framework is structured around coordinative, communicative and decision spaces, each with sequential focal points and associated outputs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating undergraduate mathematics examinations in the era of generative AI: a curriculum-level case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are transforming the educational landscape, prompting reconsideration of traditional assessment practices. In parallel, universities are exploring alternatives to in-person, closed-book examinations, raising concerns about academic integrity and pedagogical alignment in uninvigilated settings. This study investigates whether traditional closed-book mathematics examinations retain their pedagogical relevance when hypothetically administered in uninvigilated, open-book settings with GenAI access. Adopting an empirical approach, we generate, transcribe, and blind-mark GenAI submissions to eight undergraduate mathematics examinations at a Russel Group university, spanning the entirety of the first-year curriculum. By combining independent GenAI responses to individual questions, we enable a meaningful evaluation of GenAI performance, both at the level of modules and across the first-year curriculum. We find that GenAI attainment is at the level of a first-class degree, though current performance can vary between modules. Further, we find that GenAI performance is remarkably consistent when viewed across the entire curriculum, significantly more so than that of students in invigilated examinations. Our findings evidence the need for redesigning assessments in mathematics for unsupervised settings, and highlight the potential reduction in pedagogical value of current standards in the era of generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The threat of analytic flexibility in using large language models to simulate human data: A call to attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social scientists are now using large language models to create "silicon samples" - synthetic datasets intended to stand in for human respondents, aimed at revolutionising human subjects research. However, there are many analytic choices which must be made to produce these samples. Though many of these choices are defensible, their impact on sample quality is poorly understood. I map out these analytic choices and demonstrate how a very small number of decisions can dramatically change the correspondence between silicon samples and human data. Configurations (N = 252) varied substantially in their capacity to estimate (i) rank ordering of participants, (ii) response distributions, and (iii) between-scale correlations. Most critically, configurations were not consistent in quality: those that performed well on one dimension often performed poorly on another, implying that there is no "one-size-fits-all" configuration that optimises the accuracy of these samples. I call for greater attention to the threat of analytic flexibility in using silicon samples.</description>

      <title>AI and the Future of Academic Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer review remains the central quality-control mechanism of science, yet its ability to fulfill this role is increasingly strained. Empirical studies document serious shortcomings: long publication delays, escalating reviewer burden concentrated on a small minority of scholars, inconsistent quality and low inter-reviewer agreement, and systematic biases by gender, language, and institutional prestige. Decades of human-centered reforms have yielded only marginal improvements. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), is being piloted across the peer-review pipeline by journals, funders, and individual reviewers. Early studies suggest that AI assistance can produce reviews comparable in quality to humans, accelerate reviewer selection and feedback, and reduce certain biases, but also raise distinctive concerns about hallucination, confidentiality, gaming, novelty recognition, and loss of trust. In this paper, we map the aims and persistent failure modes of peer review to specific LLM applications and systematically analyze the objections they raise alongside safeguards that could make their use acceptable. Drawing on emerging evidence, we show that targeted, supervised LLM assistance can plausibly improve error detection, timeliness, and reviewer workload without displacing human judgment. We highlight advanced architectures, including fine-tuned, retrieval-augmented, and multi-agent systems, that may enable more reliable, auditable, and interdisciplinary review. We argue that ethical and practical considerations are not peripheral but constitutive: the legitimacy of AI-assisted peer review depends on governance choices as much as technical capacity. The path forward is neither uncritical adoption nor reflexive rejection, but carefully scoped pilots with explicit evaluation metrics, transparency, and accountability.</description>

      <title>General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Concept Vector Extraction for Bias Control in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perpetuate stereotypes and exhibit biases. Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these biases, but most work studies biases as a black-box problem without considering how concepts are represented within the model. We adapt techniques from representation engineering to study how the concept of "gender" is represented within LLMs. We introduce a new method that extracts concept representations via probability weighting without labeled data and efficiently selects a steering vector for measuring and manipulating the model's representation. We develop a projection-based method that enables precise steering of model predictions and demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating gender bias in LLMs and show that it also generalizes to racial bias.

      <title>Trustless Autonomy: Understanding Motivations, Benefits, and Governance Dilemmas in Self-Sovereign Decentralized AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents) combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgents eliminate centralized control and reduce human intervention, addressing key trust concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. This contributes to social computing by enabling new human cooperative paradigm "intelligence as commons." However, given ongoing challenges in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts, founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the future agentic web.</description>

      <title>Extracting memorized pieces of (copyrighted) books from open-weight language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression in their training data. Drawing on both machine learning and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we extend a recent probabilistic extraction technique to measure memorization of 50 books in 17 open-weight LLMs. Through thousands of experiments, we show that the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With respect to our specific extraction methodology, we find that most LLMs do not memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B entirely memorizes some books, like the first Harry Potter book and 1984. In fact, the first Harry Potter is so memorized that, using a seed prompt consisting of just the first few tokens of the first chapter, we can deterministically generate the entire book near-verbatim. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</description>

      <title>"What's Up, Doc?": Analyzing How Users Seek Health Information in Large-Scale Conversational AI Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and combine them into a curated dataset can be found here: https://github.com/yahskapar/HealthChat</description>

      <title>SMART: Simulated Students Aligned with Item Response Theory for Question Difficulty Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments, enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items, followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get difficulty estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with a large language model (LLM)-based scoring model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty estimates. Through extensive experiments on two real-world student response datasets, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.</description>

      <title>MINGLE: VLMs for Semantically Complex Region Detection in Urban Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.</description>
