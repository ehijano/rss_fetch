      <title>A note on an inversion algorithm for vertical ionograms for the prediction of plasma frequency profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the concept of utilizing quasi-parabolic approximations to determine plasma frequency profiles from ionograms, we present a refined multi-quasi-parabolic method for modeling the E and F layers. While a recent study AIP Advances 14 065034 introduced an approach in this direction, we identified several inaccuracies in its mathematical treatment and numerical results. By addressing these issues, we offer a clearer exposition and a more robust algorithm. Our method assumes a parabolic profile for the E layer and approximates the F layer with a series of concatenated quasi-parabolic segments, ensuring continuity and smoothness by matching derivatives at the junctions. Applied to daylight ionograms from the Jicamarca Observatory in Lima, our inversion algorithm demonstrates excellent agreement between the synthetic ionograms generated from our predicted plasma frequency profiles and the original measured data.</description>

      <title>Wavelet analysis of possible association between sunspot number and rainfall over Kerala, India: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global attention has been focused on extreme climatic changes. This paper investigates the relationship between different phases of solar activity and extreme precipitation events in Kerala, India. Sunspot number and rainfall data were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) on an annual scale. A negative correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform, the temporal relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated, revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons. Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. The results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar activity. The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. These findings are presented for the first time and may offer new perspectives on how different phases affect rainfall. This study suggests a physical link between solar activity and extreme precipitation in Kerala, which could increase predictability.</description>

      <title>A Nonhydrostatic Mass-Conserving Dynamical Core for Deep Atmospheres of Variable Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops and tests a deep-atmosphere, nonhydrostatic dynamical core (DyCore) targeted towards ground-thermosphere atmospheric prediction using the spectral element method (SEM) with Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) and Horizontally Explicit Vertically Implicit (HEVI) time-integration. Two versions of the DyCore are presented and tested, each based on a different formulation of the specific internal energy and continuity equations, which, unlike standard potential temperature formulations, are valid for variable composition atmospheres. The first version, which uses a product-rule (PR) forms of the continuity and specific internal energy equation, contains an additional pressure dilation term and does not conserve mass. The second version, which does not use the product-rule (no-PR) in the continuity and specific internal energy, contains two terms to represent pressure dilation and conserves mass to machine precision regardless of time truncation error. The pressure gradient and gravitational forces in the momentum balance equation are reformulated to reduce numerical errors at high altitudes. These new equation sets were implemented in two SEM-based atmospheric models: the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA) and the Navy Environmental Prediction sysTem Using a Nonhydrostatic Engine (NEPTUNE). Numerical results using both a deep-atmosphere and shallow-atmosphere baroclinic instability, a balanced zonal flow, and a high-altitude orographic gravity wave verify the fidelity of the dynamics at low and high altitudes and for constant and variable composition atmospheres. These results are compared to existing deep-atmosphere dynamical cores and a Fourier-ray code, indicating that the proposed discretized equation sets are viable DyCore candidates for next-generation ground-to-thermosphere atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Efficient modeling of sub-kilometer surface wind with Gaussian processes and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately representing surface weather at the sub-kilometer scale is crucial for optimal decision-making in a wide range of applications. This motivates the use of statistical techniques to provide accurate and calibrated probabilistic predictions at a lower cost compared to numerical simulations. Wind represents a particularly challenging variable to model due to its high spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Gaussian processes and neural networks to model surface wind gusts at sub-kilometer resolution, leveraging multiple data sources, including numerical weather prediction models, topographical descriptors, and in-situ measurements. Results demonstrate the added value of modeling the multivariate covariance structure of the variable of interest, as opposed to only applying a univariate probabilistic regression approach. Modeling the covariance enables the optimal integration of observed measurements from ground stations, which is shown to reduce the continuous ranked probability score compared to the baseline. Moreover, it allows the generation of realistic fields that are also marginally calibrated, aided by scalable techniques such as random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning. We discuss the effect of different modeling choices, as well as different degrees of approximation, and present our results for a case study.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Global Simulation of Nonlocal Gravity Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global climate models typically operate at a grid resolution of hundreds of kilometers and fail to resolve atmospheric mesoscale processes, e.g., clouds, precipitation, and gravity waves (GWs). Model representation of these processes and their sources is essential to the global circulation and planetary energy budget, but subgrid scale contributions from these processes are often only approximately represented in models using parameterizations. These parameterizations are subject to approximations and idealizations, which limit their capability and accuracy. The most drastic of these approximations is the "single-column approximation" which completely neglects the horizontal evolution of these processes, resulting in key biases in current climate models. With a focus on atmospheric GWs, we present the first-ever global simulation of atmospheric GW fluxes using machine learning (ML) models trained on the WINDSET dataset to emulate global GW emulation in the atmosphere, as an alternative to traditional single-column parameterizations. Using an Attention U-Net-based architecture trained on globally resolved GW momentum fluxes, we illustrate the importance and effectiveness of global nonlocality, when simulating GWs using data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>Solar activity and extreme rainfall over Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala, India. Kerala receives minimum and maximum rainfall during winter and monsoon seasons. Sunspot number, F10.7 Index, and cosmic ray intensity are the solar indices considered, and their variations with rainfall are studied over 57 years (1965-2021), i.e., starting from Solar Cycle 20. Correlative studies are performed for each solar cycle, and correlation coefficients are calculated. We find that rainfall in Kerala is correlated with sunspot activity but with varying degrees of significance. During Solar Cycle 21, rainfall and solar activity are correlated with high significance during both winter and monsoon seasons. The variation of different solar indices with rainfall is studied. The winter season showed a better link between the sun and rainfall than the monsoon season. The years with rainfall surplus and deficiency are calculated and compared with the solar indices. {We find that the years with rainfall excess and deficit mainly occur in the years around solar maximum or minimum (within $\pm$2 years).} We hypothesize a physical relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala that contributes to their predictability.</description>
