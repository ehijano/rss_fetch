      <title>Strongly Coupled Quantum Field Theory in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of Quantum Field Theories in general backgrounds through the lens of the path integral, in the formulation known as the Functorial QFT. With the aim of studying properties of strongly coupled QFTs, we present key concepts and techniques such as the effective action, renormalization group flow, and the 1/N expansion.
  At the fixed points of the RG flow we typically find Conformal Field Theories, which are symmetric under local rescaling of the metric. Among other things, CFTs play a central role in the context of QFT in Anti-de Sitter spacetime, through what is known as the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  Finally, the developed formalism is applied to analyze the O(N) model in AdS at finite coupling. In particular, we focus on the non-singlet sector, which requires an understanding of crossed-channel diagram contributions to the s-channel conformal block decomposition.</description>

      <title>Multicentered black hole saddles for supersymmetric indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersymmetric index in string theory can sometimes have a discontinuous integer-valued jump at co-dimension one surfaces in moduli space called walls of marginal stability. When the index counts black hole microstates, crossing such walls of marginal stability amounts to the appearance or disappearance of a large number of such states. While wall-crossing has been understood in string theory and through the disappearance of extremal Lorentzian supergravity solutions as the moduli are varied, there has been no understanding about how the discontinuous changes in the index occur at the level of the gravitational path integral. In this paper, we find the finite-temperature saddles in $4d$ flatspace supergravity in which fermionic fields are periodic when going around the thermal circle that correspond to the multi-center black hole contributions to the index. By analyzing these saddles, we can explain how wall-crossing occurs: as the scalar moduli in supergravity are varied at the asymptotic boundary, for a given split of the charges, the saddle point equations can no longer be solved and, consequently, the corresponding multi-center saddle no longer contributes to the index. While the values of the scalars and the jump in the index when a wall is crossed all agree with the prediction from previously found Lorentzian supergravity solutions, the saddles in the index exhibit a much richer moduli space, which we analyze in detail.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bootstrap for RCFT: signs and bounds for quasi-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>Trivialization of the gravitational Green-Schwarz mechanism in the non-relativistic limit of string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the gravitational Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism becomes trivial in the non-relativistic (NR) limit of ten-dimensional heterotic supergravity with four-derivative corrections. We perform a NR expansion of the Kalb-Ramond field and identify the finite Green-Schwarz transformation in this limit, which can be interpreted as a non-covariant SO(8) transformation. We then construct an explicit field redefinition such that the redefined two-form is invariant under this symmetry. This result is compared with the previously reported trivialization of the gauge Green-Schwarz mechanism under the same limit. Both field redefinitions can be implemented simultaneously, and the associated Chern-Simons terms are exact, arising directly from the redefinition structure, and leading to a trivial Bianchi identity. These results imply that anomaly cancellation becomes automatic in the NR regime, extending the consistent formulations of NR heterotic string theories and giving rise to a richer class of topological heterotic backgrounds with simpler thermodynamical properties such as the Wald entropy and the first law.</description>

      <title>Extended JT supergravity and random matrix models: The power of the string equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of supersymmetric Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theories are known to be described (in the Euclidean path integral formulation) by double-scaled random matrix models. Such matrix models can be characterized using a certain ``string equation''. It was shown recently that in extended supergravity, when the number of BPS states scales as ${\rm e}^{S_0}$, where $S_0$ is the extremal entropy, a special ansatz for the leading order solution of the string equation yields the supergravity spectrum. Somewhat miraculously, the construction showed that the functional form of the non-BPS (continuum) sector predicts the precise form of the BPS sector, showing the robustness of the supergravity/matrix-model correspondence. In this paper, we refine the analysis and show that the string equation, combined with some simple requirements on solutions, are powerful tools for constraining the spectrum of extended JT supergravity theories. We re-explore the cases of ${N}{=}2$ and (small) ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity, and then explore the new cases of spectra from ${N}{=}3$ and large ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity (recently derived by Heydeman, Shi, and Turiaci) showing that our approach also works naturally for (nearly) all the models. Based on this success, we conjecture that these new supergravity models also have matrix model descriptions.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Correlators from Amplitubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the wavefunction coefficients for conformally coupled scalars in an FRW cosmology have been presented as a sum over amplitude-like functions known as {\it amplitubes}. In this work we extend this analysis to full {\it correlation functions}. Remarkably, the amplitube expansion of the correlator exhibits many vanishing contributions that are otherwise present in the expansion of the wavefunction. Moreover, while the wavefunction coefficients suffer from relative minus signs between terms, the surviving terms in correlation function do not. These observations point to a hidden simplicity in the structure of the correlation function compared to that of the wavefunction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Scale without conformal invariance from integrable deformations of coset CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the $\lambda$-model on $SU(3)_k/U(2)_k$ and we compute the one-loop $\beta$-function for the deformation parameter $\lambda$. Its non-compact version for $SU(2,1)_{-k}/U(2)_{-k}$ is also considered, whose target space admits an asymptotic region that can be reached when one of the coordinates becomes large. The asymptotic model can be seen as an integrable deformation of the $SU(2)_k/U(1)$ WZW model together with a linear dilaton and a free boson, where integrability is inherited from the parental $\lambda$-model. By taking an asymptotic double-scaling limit of the $SU(2,1)_{-k}/U(2)_{-k}$ model, we obtain a two-dimensional field theory that is scale-invariant but not conformally invariant at one-loop order. Crucially, this deformation does not admit a Kerr-Schild form, unlike the cases studied in arXiv:2109.05040. However, in a suitable asymptotic regime, scale invariance is enhanced to full conformal invariance. Finally, we construct Type-II supergravity embeddings of the asymptotic model for specific values of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Two-point functions and the vacuum densities in the Casimir effect for the Proca field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the vacuum state for the Proca field in the geometry of two parallel plates on background of (D+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The two-point functions for the vector potential and the field tensor are evaluated for higher-dimensional generalizations of the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) and perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Explicit expressions are provided for the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the electric and magnetic field squares, field condensate, and for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. In the zero-mass limit the VEVs of the electric and magnetic field squares and the condensate reduce to the corresponding expressions for a massless vector field. The same is the case for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the problem with PEC conditions. However, for PMC conditions the zero-mass limit for the vacuum energy-momentum tensor differs from the corresponding VEV for a massless field. This difference in the zero-mass limits is related to the different influences of the boundary conditions on the longitudinal polarization mode of a massive vector field. The PMC conditions constrain all the polarization modes including the longitudinal mode, whereas PEC conditions do not influence the longitudinal mode. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor is diagonal. The normal stress is uniformly distributed in the region between the plates and vanishes in the remaining regions. The corresponding Casimir forces are attractive for both boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Capturing quantum phase transition in the ultraviolet region by holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal for the first time that ultraviolet (UV) observables can diagnose quantum phase transitions (QPTs). In a class of holographic models exhibiting metal-insulator transitions, we study two types of UV observables -- high-frequency conductivity and short-range entanglement. Remarkably, we find that the derivatives of these UV observables exhibit extrema near the quantum critical point. Analytical results show these critical behaviors arise from the deformation of the asymptotic bulk geometry. Moreover, these UV diagnostics show enhanced robustness to thermal fluctuations compared to typical infrared (IR) diagnostics, providing a clean method to identify quantum criticality at finite temperature. This work opens a new window for exploring quantum critical phenomena via UV physics in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Type IIB at eight derivatives: Five-Point Axio-Dilaton Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Type IIB eight-derivative effective Lagrangian beyond the quartic level, focusing on interactions involving gravitons and axio-dilatons. We show how to translate five-point scattering amplitudes into genuine five-point contact terms and extract all perturbative contributions to the effective action. Our result is consistent with T-duality predictions at tree level in the NSNS sector. We find that couplings with an even/odd number of scalars are neutral/charged under $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and use this feature to deduce their non-perturbative completion. The mixed NSNS/RR structures that cannot be deduced from the pure NSNS sector allow us to unambiguously fix the kinematics, which turns out to be the same for tree level and one loop. In Type IIA, these structures are essential for establishing agreement of string-theoretic corrections with the circle reduction of M-theory higher-derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter: the space-frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of isotropic chiral matter, as described by Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, arises in distinct physical contexts ranging from condensed matter systems to Lorentz-violating extensions of high-energy physics. Here, we derive exact expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields that contribute independently to Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter. Each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, yielding radiation that emerges at a characteristic angle, akin to the standard case. Furthermore, we identify specific frequency ranges that permit zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones for a given setup. Remarkably, one sector of the model allows for the existence of threshold-free Cherenkov radiation arising from slowly-moving charges.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Statistics for Dirac and Majorana Neutrinos using Spinor-Helicity techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the applicability of quantum statistics to distinguish Dirac from Majorana neutrinos in multi-neutrino final states. In particular, debate has arisen over the validity of the Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem in these processes, i.e. that any distinction between the Dirac and Majorana processes goes to zero as the neutrino mass goes to zero. Here we approach this problem equipped with spinor-helicity methods generalized for massive Dirac and Majorana fermions. We explicitly calculate all helicity amplitudes for the decay of a light scalar particle to two neutrinos and two oppositely charged leptons. This allows us to pinpoint the crucial steps which could lead to claims of a violation of the confusion theorem. We show that if the correct anti-symmetrization of Dirac to Majorana amplitudes is used, identification of which is clear in this framework, and all relevant contributions are appropriately summed, a scalar decay into two charged leptons and two neutrinos satisfies the Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favor a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a class of thawing scalar field models propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the Om diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of scattering amplitudes and interferences in perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flagship application of quantum computers is the simulation of other quantum systems, including quantum field theories. In this article, we show how quantum computers can be employed to naturally calculate Feynman diagrams and their interferences in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We simulate the colour parts of the interactions directly on the quantum computer, while the kinematic parts are for now pre-computed classically. For processes where some of the external particles are identical, we find the first hints of a potential quantum advantage. We validate our techniques using simulated quantum computers. Furthermore, for toy examples we also demonstrate our algorithms on a 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. The work constitutes a further key step towards a full quantum simulation of generic perturbative QCD processes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Quasinormal Modes and Grey-Body Factors of Bonanno-Reuter Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Bonanno--Reuter quantum-corrected black hole arising in the asymptotic safety scenario, focusing on QNMs and grey-body factors. Assuming the RG parameter $\tilde{\omega}$ is fixed to its phenomenologically motivated value, we treat the interpolation parameter $\gamma$ as free and investigate how it modifies the black hole's response to axial gravitational perturbations. Quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB method with Pad\'e approximants, and their dependence on $\gamma$ and the black hole mass $M$ is analyzed. We find that the Schwarzschild limit is rapidly recovered for large $M$ or large $\gamma$, while significant deviations arise in the quantum regime. The accuracy of the WKB results is confirmed by time-domain integration of the wave equation. Comparison of grey-body factors computed via both the WKB method and the quasinormal mode correspondence are in a good concordance. Our findings indicate that quantum corrections can leave significant imprints in the ringdown and radiation spectra, while preserving consistency with classical results in the appropriate limit.</description>

      <title>Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the Early Universe: The Ringdown of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Trapped string states in AdS$_5$ black hole geometry: A path toward Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a closed bosonic string in the curved spacetime of an AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from the Polyakov action, we perform a canonical quantization of the string and formulate its quantum mechanical equation of motion in the Schr\"odinger (string coordinate) representation. This framework facilitates in obtaining quantum mechanical wave equation governing the radial and angular modes of the string. A central result of our analysis is the emergence of a trapping radius in the exterior region of the black hole. Near this radius, the radial motion of the string is governed by an effective potential that supports small, quantized oscillations, akin to a quantum harmonic oscillator. This behavior indicates a localization of the string at the trapping surface, where it becomes dynamically confined. The angular sector of the wave function is found to be governed by the confluent Heun equation, yielding confluent Heun functions as the angular part of the wave function. The emergence of a trapping surface is analogous to the stretched horizon proposed by Susskind in the context of black hole complementarity. The quantized harmonic oscillation of the string at the trapping radius complements with the Planck's black body whence the string can emit black-body radiation. Thus, the quantum dynamics of strings in black hole spacetimes offers a novel path to probing the quantum origin of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs) generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of SGWB across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current PTA observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Spectral networks for polynomial cubic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cubic differentials and their spectral networks on Riemann surfaces, focusing on the polynomial case on the Riemann sphere. We introduce the notion of spectral core as the primary tool for our study, refining the classical notion of core in the theory of flat surfaces, and show that it controls the birthing process of spectral network trajectories. As an application, we completely characterize the polynomial cubic differentials having saddle connections or critical tripods when the degree $d$ is at most $3$; in particular, we obtain the relevant degenerations as the phase is varied and determine explicitly the wall-and-chamber structure. In this case, we obtain the BPS structure according to Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke's algorithm, and verify that it satisfies the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. In physics language, this corresponds to computing the BPS spectrum of a certain four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory, known as the $(A_{2},A_{d-1})$ generalized Argyres-Douglas theory.</description>

      <title>From spatial to null infinity: Connecting initial data to peeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of space-time is studied by imposing conditions on the asymptotics of the metric. These conditions are weak enough to include large classes of physically relevant isolated space-times, but have a rich enough structure to be able to define important physically meaningful quantities like mass, angular momentum, and gravitational waves.
  By using a unified expansion of the metric in a neighborhood of spatial infinity that includes a piece of null infinity, we connect the asymptotic expansions of solutions to Einstein's equations in the different asymptotic regimes. Within the class of space-times under consideration, we find a connection between the peeling properties of the Weyl scalars and symmetries of initial data near spatial infinity. In particular, we show that for initial data that to leading order is symmetric under parity + time reversal, $\Psi_2$ has the usual $1/r^3$ fall-off rate at null infinity. If, in addition, the subleading part of the data is antisymmetric under parity + time reversal, then $\Psi_1$ has the usual $1/r^4$ fall-off rate at future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Defects in 4d SCFTs from supergravity and holographic renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIB string theory admits Janus solutions connecting $\text{AdS}_5$ vacua. These geometries correspond to interface conformal field theories and are naturally described in five-dimensional supergravity as $\text{AdS}_4$ foliations over an interval. In this work, we introduce a novel type of Janus solution in $\text{AdS}_5$, featuring $\text{AdS}_2 \times S^2$ foliations instead of $\text{AdS}_4$. We interpret these solutions as the supergravity duals of line defects in four-dimensional SCFTs and we discuss their D-brane engineering. Our primary tool is Romans supergravity in five dimensions, which provides a simple Type IIB truncation over $S^5$. Within this framework, under specific conditions, we construct regular solutions interpolating between $\text{AdS}_5$ and $\text{AdS}_2 \times \mathbb{R}^3$. These geometries represent one-parameter deformations of $\text{AdS}_5$ vacua and are characterized by a running profile for two-form gauge potentials and a scalar field in the supergravity bulk. Finally, using holographic renormalization, we explicitly compute the on-shell action of the defect and we discuss the one-point functions in the holographic field theory.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of mutual information in the Page curve for a functional renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work delves into probing the importance of mutual information of relevant subsystems in obtaining the correct time-evolution of fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation, as suggested by Page. This was done by considering a functional renormalization group improved or simply, quantum corrected Schwarzschild black solution which captures the flavour of an effective theory of quantum gravity. The mentioned black hole solution emerges from a asymptotically safe average effective action which describes a trajectory in momentum-space and satisfies a renormalizarion group equation. Furthermore, in the before Page time scenario, the behaviour of the mutual information between appropriate subsystems over time leads to the Hartman-Maldacena time. The observations made for the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole have been compared to the same made for the standard Schwarzschild black hole in order to draw some novel conclusions. Based upon our observations, we also propose a formula for computing fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation for an eternal black hole, in presence of the island.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks ($q$) and gluons ($g$) mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, characterized by the Mandelstam variable $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$, which corresponds to the total energy squared in the center-of-momentum frame, being much larger than any particle mass scale, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \to gg$, $gg \to q\bar{q}$, $gq \to gq$, and $qq \to qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We renormalize massless scalar effective field theories (EFTs) to higher loop orders and higher orders in the EFT expansion. To facilitate EFT calculations with the R* renormalization method, we construct suitable operator bases using Hilbert series and related ideas in commutative algebra and conformal representation theory, including their novel application to off-shell correlation functions. We obtain new results ranging from full one loop at mass dimension twelve to five loops at mass dimension six. We explore the structure of the anomalous dimension matrix with an emphasis on its zeros, and investigate the effects of conformal and orthonormal operators. For the real scalar, the zeros can be explained by a `non-renormalization' rule recently derived by Bern et al. For the complex scalar we find two new selection rules for mixing $n$- and $(n-2)$-field operators, with $n$ the maximal number of fields at a fixed mass dimension. The first appears only when the $(n-2)$-field operator is conformal primary, and is valid at one loop. The second appears in more generic bases, and is valid at three loops. Finally, we comment on how the Hilbert series we construct may be used to provide a systematic enumeration of a class of evanescent operators that appear at a particular mass dimension in the scalar EFT.</description>

Abstract: We consider a recently introduced extension of General Relativity dubbed as Cotton gravity (CG), based on the use of the Cotton tensor, to estimate the size of a new constant $\gamma$ appearing within a spherically symmetric, vacuum solution of the theory. Taking into account its non-asymptotically flat character, we use the inferred size of the central brightness depression of the supermassive object at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy (Sgr A*) by the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain at $2\sigma$ the CG parameter as $\gamma M \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-12}$. We study the potential observational consequences from the smallness of such a value using exact and numerical expressions for the deflection angle, optical images from optically and geometrically thin accretion disks, isoradials, and instability scales (Lyapunov index) of nearly bound geodesics associated to photon rings. Our results point towards the impossibility to distinguish between these two geometries using current and foreseeable techniques in the field of interferometric detection of optical sources.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <title>The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since detailed mathematical models of the Universe emerged from Einstein's general theory of relativity. Such debates have revolved around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established demarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining how to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges and limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin, composition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the scientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an emerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical successes in establishing the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this remarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter, and dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in revealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the epistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of these exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon whether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

Abstract: We identify some of the $k$-invariants for the Postnikov tower of the stable and unstable 4-sphere. Assuming the stable Hypothesis H of Fiorenza--Sati--Schreiber, we use the resulting obstruction theory to prove that the Chern--Simons term in the effective action of M-theory is well defined. In particular, we do not assume the presence of an $E_8$-gauge field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Almost Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifolds and the instanton condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is observed that on a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion (ACYT) 6-manifold with co-closed Lee form the curvature of the torsion connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the torsion connection. The same conclusion holds for any (non necessarily compact) balanced ACYT 6-manifold. In particular, on a CYT 6-manifold the Strominger-Bismut connection is an $SU(3)$-instanton if and only if the torsion is parallel with respect to the Strominger-Bismut connection provided either the CYT 6-manifold is compact with co-closed Lee form or it is a balanced CYT 6-manifold.</description>
