      <title>PyTICS: An Iterative Method for Photometric Lightcurve Intercalibration using Comparison Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive reverberation mapping monitoring programs combine ground-based photometric observations from different telescopes, requiring intercalibration of lightcurves to reduce systematic instrumental differences. We present a new iterative algorithm to calibrate photometric time-series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using 100s of comparison stars on the same images, building upon the established method of ensemble photometry. The algorithm determines telescope-specific and epoch-specific correction parameters, and simultaneously computes a multi-component noise model to account for underestimated uncertainties based on the scatter in the comparison star data, effectively identifying problematic epochs, telescopes, and stars. No assumptions need to be made about the AGN variability shape, and the algorithm can in principle be applied to any astronomical object. We demonstrate our method on lightcurves taken with ten 1-m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) robotic telescope network. Comparing our results to other intercalibration tools, we find that the algorithm can more accurately quantify the uncertainties in the data. We describe additional corrections that can be made for particularly bluer AGNs like Fairall 9, arising due to systematic effects dependent on star colour.</description>

      <title>Applying the Principles of Universal Design to Make Astronomy More Accessible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal Design (UD), an approach to accessibility that was first conceptualized in architecture to make buildings physically accessible, has since been applied to curriculum design to make classrooms accessible for a larger range of learning needs. In this paper, we illustrate how the concepts of UD are relevant outside of architecture and the creation of curricula by highlighting examples of norms that exist in the field of astronomy that create barriers for disabled folks. we discuss ways the foundations of UD can be applied more generally to department culture, conferences, outreach events, and academia as a whole to make STEM fields more inclusive. In order to implement UD in these sectors, one must create multiple pathways or options for folks to engage with and show their success in astronomy. While UD is critical for disabled folks, it can easily be expanded to include the promotion of people whose backgrounds and/or identities are currently underrepresented or under-supported in STEM. Lastly, we introduce guiding questions and tools for departments and institutions to evaluate the accessibility of their activities and traditions to disabled individuals. In summary, we aim to show the importance of increased accessibility and provide some strategies to make STEM more inclusive to disabled people by using the mindset and principles of UD.</description>

      <title>High Precision RF Pulse Shaping with Direct RF Sampling for Future Linear Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In various of particle accelerator designs, amplitude and phase modulation methods are commonly applied to shape the RF pulses for implementing pulse compressors or compensating for the fluctuations introduced by the high-power RF components and beam loading effects. Phase modulations are typically implemented with additional phase shifters that require drive or control electronics. With our recent next-generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform developed based on direct RF sampling technology of RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) devices, RF pulse shaping can be realized without the analogue phase shifters, which can significantly simplify the system architecture. We performed a range of high-power experiments in the C-band to evaluate the RF pulse-shaping capabilities of the NG-LLRF system at different stages of the RF circuits. In this paper, the high-power characterization results with the Cool Copper Collider (C3) structure driven by RF pulses with different modulation schemes will be described. With the pulse modulation and demodulation completely implemented in the digital domain, the RF pulse shaping schemes can be rapidly adapted for X-band structures simply by adding analogue mixers.</description>

      <title>Next Generation LLRF Control and Monitoring System for S-Band Linear Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for S-band linear accelerating structures are typically implemented with heterodyne base architectures. We have developed and characterized the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) based on the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) for C-band accelerating structures, and the platform delivered the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation levels considerably better than the requirement of the targeted applications. The NG-LLRF system uses the direct RF sampling technique of the RFSoC, which significantly simplified the architecture compared to the conventional LLRF. We have extended the frequency range of the NG-LLRF to S-band and experimented with different RFSoC devices and system designs to meet the more stringent requirements for S-band LLRF applications. In this paper, the characterization results of the platform with different system architectures will be summarized and the high-power test results of the NG-LLRF with the S-band accelerating structure in the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) test facility at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will be presented and analyzed.</description>

      <title>MOA-2022-BLG-091Lb and KMT-2024-BLG-1209Lb: Microlensing planets detected through weak caustic-crossing signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light curves of the microlensing events MOA-2022-BLG-091 and KMT-2024-BLG-1209 exhibit anomalies with very similar features. These anomalies appear near the peaks of the light curves, where the magnifications are moderately high, and are distinguished by weak caustic-crossing features with minimal distortion while the source remains inside the caustic. To achieve a deeper understanding of these anomalies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the lensing events. We carried out binary-lens modeling with a thorough exploration of the parameter space. This analysis revealed that the anomalies in both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is complicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091, the main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly identified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source trajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the interpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy, which leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through either the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian analysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with masses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence stars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of around 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to resolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures of the degenerate solutions. In contrast, the degeneracy in MOA-2022-BLG-091, which occurs by chance rather than from inherent characteristics, is expected to be resolved by the future space based Roman RGES microlensing survey.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Microstrip Detector for Power-Limited and Large Sensitive Area Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A silicon microstrip detector (SSD) has been developed to have state of the art spatial resolution and a large sensitive area under stringent power constraints. The design incorporates three floating strips with their bias resistors inserted between two aluminum readout strips. Beam test measurements with the single sensor confirmed that this configuration achieves a total detection efficiency of $99.8 \, \%$ and spatial resolution $7.6 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ for MIPs. A double-$\eta$ algorithm was developed to optimize hit position reconstruction for this SSD. The design can be adapted for large area silicon detectors.</description>

      <title>Detecting Atmospheric CO2 Trends as Population-Level Signatures for Long-Term Stable Water Oceans and Biotic Activity on Temperate Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying key observables is essential for enhancing our knowledge of exoplanet habitability and biospheres, as well as improving future mission capabilities. While currently challenging, future observatories such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable atmospheric observations of a diverse sample of temperate terrestrial worlds. Using thermal emission spectra that represent conventional predictions of atmospheric CO2 variability across the Habitable Zone (HZ), we assess the ability of the LIFE mission - as a specific concept for a future space-based interferometer - to detect CO2 trends indicative of the carbonate-silicate (Cb-Si) weathering feedback, a well-known habitability marker and potential biological tracer. Therefore, we explore the feasibility of differentiating between CO2 trends in biotic and abiotic planet populations. We create synthetic exoplanet populations based on geochemistry-climate predictions and perform retrievals on simulated thermal emission observations. The results demonstrate the robust detection of population-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population sizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed spectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral resolution, R = 50. However, biased CO2 partial pressure constraints hinder accurate differentiation between biotic and abiotic trends. If these biases were corrected, accurate differentiation could be achieved for populations with $\geq$ 100 EECs. We conclude that LIFE can effectively enable population-level characterization of temperate terrestrial atmospheres and detect Cb-Si cycle driven CO2 trends as habitability indicators. Nevertheless, the identified biases underscore the importance of testing atmospheric characterization performance against the broad diversity expected for planetary populations.</description>

      <title>Apache Point rapid response characterization of primitive pre-impact detection asteroid 2024 RW$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-impact detection asteroids (PIDAs) may be detected only a few hours before their impact with Earth, providing a brief opportunity to characterize them before impact. We describe the characterization of PIDA 2024 RW$_1$, which was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 2024 September 4 at 05:43 UTC, before it entered the atmosphere near the northern Philippines at 16:39 UTC. We observed 2024 RW$_1$ with the Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera on the Apache Point Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-m telescope on 2024 September 4 10:16 UTC. We obtained g, r, i, and z photometry of 2024 RW$_1$, yielding color indices of g-r = 0.47$\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.13$\pm$0.04, i-z = -0.11$\pm$0.07, and g-i = 0.60$\pm$0.04, corresponding to a spectral slope of 0.67$\pm$0.40~$\%$/100 nm. The closest match to an asteroid spectral type is with B-type asteroids from the C-complex. We detect variations in the time series photometry of the asteroid with an amplitude of $\sim$0.75, and a double-peaked rotation period of $\sim$1900 s. Assuming a visible albedo of 0.07 and a density of $\sim$1500 kg/m$^3$, and using the derived absolute magnitude of 32.2$\pm$0.5, we calculate that the asteroid has a diameter of 1.8$\pm$0.4 m and a total mass of $\sim$5000 kg. The most likely source of 2024 RW$_1$ is the 3:1 mean motion resonance followed by the $\nu_6$ resonance, according to NEOMOD3.</description>

      <title>Imaging a ring-like structure and the extended jet of M87 at 86 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The galaxy M87 is one of the prime targets for high resolution radio imaging to investigate the supermassive black hole, accretion flow, and relativistic jet. However, it remains challenging to observe them jointly. In 2018, GMVA+ALMA observations at 86 GHz enabled the simultaneous reconstruction of a ring structure and the extended jet emission. In order to analyze the ring and jet of M87, conventional 'CLEAN' algorithms were mainly employed alongside the RML method 'SMILI' in previous work. To test the robustness of the reconstructed structures of M87 GMVA+ALMA observations at 86 GHz, we estimate the ring diameter, width, and the extended jet emission with the possible central spine by two different novel imaging algorithms: 'resolve' and 'DoG-HiT'. Overall, reconstructions are consistent with the 'CLEAN' and 'SMILI' images. The ring structure of M87 is resolved at a higher resolution and the posterior distribution of M87 ring features is explored. The 'resolve' images show that the ring diameter is 60.9 +- 2.2 muas and its width is 16.0 +- 0.9 muas. The ring diameter and the ring width measured from the 'DoG-HiT' image are 61.0 muas and 20.6 muas, respectively. The ring diameter is therefore in agreement with the estimation in the previous work (64 +4 -8 muas). Two bright spots in the ring are reconstructed by four independent imaging methods. Therefore, the substructure in the ring most likely results from the data. A consistent limb-brightened jet structure is reconstructed by 'resolve' and 'DoG-HiT', albeit with a less pronounced central spine. Modern data-driven imaging methods confirm the ring and jet structure in M87, and complement traditional VLBI methods with novel perspectives on evaluating the significance of the recovered features. They confirm the result of the previous report.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit light curves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multiplanet transit light curves that display transit timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub. We demonstrate with a simulated data set that Bayesian inference with the NUTS HMC algorithm, which uses the model gradient, can outperform the affine invariant (e.g. emcee) MCMC algorithm in CPU time per effective sample, and we find that the relative sampling efficiency improves with the number of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Bench-v1: A Benchmark on Gravitational Physics Discovery for Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern science emerged from reasoning over repeatedly-observed planetary motions. We present Gravity-Bench-v1, an environment-based benchmark that challenges AI agents on tasks that parallel this historical development. Gravity-Bench-v1 evaluates agents on the discovery of physics concealed within a dynamic environment, using rigorous gravitational dynamics simulations. Gravity-Bench includes out-of-distribution cases, i.e. with physics that deviates from the real world, to evaluate true scientific generalization capabilities. Agents must plan to collect data within an experimental budget and must perform a dynamic form of data analysis and reasoning to solve tasks efficiently. Our benchmark admits an open-ended space of solutions. Reference solutions for each task are provided to calibrate AI performance against human expertise. Technically at an upper-undergraduate level, our benchmark proves challenging to baseline AI agents. Gravity-Bench-v1 and planned extensions should help map out AI progress towards scientific discovery capabilities.</description>

      <title>SHARAD Illuminates Deeper Martian Subsurface Structures with a Boost from Very Large Rolls of the MRO Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28{\deg} to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120{\deg} roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0{\deg} roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.</description>
