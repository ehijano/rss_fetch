      <title>Experimental study of coupled quantum billiards with integrable and chaotic classical dynamics and test of a special Rosenzweig-Porter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental study of the spectral properties of quantum systems consisting of two quantum billiards (QBs), one with chaotic, the other one with integrable classical dynamics, that are coupled to each other via an opening in a common wall. They are compared to those of a special case of the Rosenzweig-Porter model with random matrices composed of two diagonal blocks modeling the spectral properties of the QBs, that are coupled with a tunable parameter. We demonstrate that this model is suitable for the description of the experimental data and thus may be employed to determine the strength of the coupling. It results from the increasing overlap of eigenmodes in the QBs penetrating through the opening into the other one, leading to a mixing of their eigenstates, and the breaking of the symmetry present in the QB with integrable dynamics. This implicates deviations of the spectral properties from those of typical quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics, respectively, and approaches those of a fully chaotic system for sufficiently large coupling strength. In contrast in previous studies the transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics was induced by introducing a random potential of increasing strength into such a QB and applicability of a variant of the Rosenzweig-Porter model was tested.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic versus relativistic quantum scars in billiard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the features of scarred eigenstates of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs), graphene billiards (GBs) and Haldane graphene billiards (HGBs) and recapitulate those for nonrelativistic quantum billiards (QBs) with the shapes of a full- and quarter-stadium billiard. Here, we restrict for the GBs and HGBs to the region of linear dispersion around the Fermi energy, where they are effectively described by the same Dirac equation for massless spin-1/2 particles as NBs. Scarred wave functions of the nonrelativistic billiards and spinor functions of the relativistic ones are localized along the same types of periodic orbits, the most prominent ones being bouncing-ball orbits. The objective is to demonstrate that the properties of the scarred eigenstates observed in the full- and quarter-stadium GB do not comply with those of relativistic quantum systems. For this we apply the semiclassical approach associated with such non-generic contributions, which was developed for the spectral density of QBs and NBs. It provides semiclassical trace formulas in terms of the periodic orbits associated with a scarred wave function and a procedure to extract such contributions from the eigenvalue spectra. Furthermore, we analyze momentum distributions and Husimi functions of such scarred states and employ them to classify scarred wave functions according to the periodic orbits along which they are localized. We show that for the GB the semiclassical approach, the spectral properties, the symmetry properties and generally properties of the wave functions all comply with those of the nonrelativistic QB, whereas for the HGB they agree well with those of the NB, implying that the quantum scars observed in GBs are not relativistic.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and chimera-like states of nanoemitters coupled to plasmon-polaritons in a lattice of conducting nanorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate semiclassical dynamics of the optical field produced by quantum nanoemitters (NEs) embedded in a periodic lattice of conducting nanorings (NRs), in which plasmon polaritons (PPs) are excited. The coupling between PPs and NEs through the radiated optical field leads to establishment of a significant cross-correlation between NEs, so that their internal dynamics (photocurrent affected by the laser irradiation) depends on the NR's plasma frequency $\omega _{p}$. The transition to this regime,combined with the nonlinearity of the system, leads to a steep increase of the photocurrent in the NEs, as well as to non-smooth (chimera-like or chaotic) behavior in the critical (transition) region, where small variations of $\omega _{p}$ lead to significant changes in the level of the NE pairwise cross-correlations. The chimera-like state is realized as coexistence of locally synchronized and desynchronized NE dynamical states. A fit of the dependence of the critical current on $\omega _{p}$ is found, being in agreement with results of numerical simulations. The critical effect may help to design new optical devices, using dispersive nanolattices which are made available by modern nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>On the attractor in a high-dimensional neural network dynamics of reservoir computing: Lyapunov analysis viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical developments of reservoir computing have clarified a sufficient condition about which reservoir computing can capture the dynamics of a target system, enabling the reconstruction of dynamical invariants. Even when the condition is relaxed, the reservoir computing is found to succeed in reconstructing time series. In this study, we investigate numerically the dynamical structures underlying the embedding structure by comparing the Lyapunov spectrum of a high-dimensional neural network in a reservoir computing model with that of the actual system. We also compute Lyapunov exponents restricted to the tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high-dimensional neural network. Our results provide numerical evidence that reservoir computing can accurately identify the Lyapunov spectrum of the target system, including all negative exponents.</description>

      <title>Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.</description>
