      <title>Stability of soluble surfactant-laden falling film over a hydrophobic incline in the presence of external shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic stability analysis of gravity-driven, soluble surfactant-laden fluid streaming down a slippery, slanted plane in the presence of external shear force is being explored in this article. The Navier-Stokes equations are considered for the fluid flow along with the appropriate advection-diffusion equations for the concentration of different surfactant species. The monomers considered here are anticipated to dissolve in the bulk flow and can be adsorbed at the interface of air-liquid as well. Also, the adsorption-desorption kinetics of the surfactants at the free space is taken into consideration. The motivation behind this work is to extend the work of Karapetsas and Bontozoglou[1] for flow over a slippery bottom and in the presence of externally imposed shear forces and observe their impact on the flow dynamics. The Orr-Sommerfeld eigensystem is obtained, then it is solved analytically using the longwave approximation method in the longwave regime ($k \ll 1$) and subsequently, the Chebyshev spectral collocation method is employed for numerical evaluation in the arbitrary wave regime. Using the analytical method, two longwave modes, viz, surface mode and surfactant mode, are detected. Alternatively, the numerical analysis substantiated the existence of temporal surface and surfactant modes. Moreover, another temporal mode named shear mode arises in the high modified Reynolds number region at a low inclination angle. Thereafter, the modified Reynolds-Orr energy equation is deduced under the normal mode conditions, and the behaviour of different energy components is investigated for various slip parameters and imposed shear force.</description>

      <title>A systematic characterisation of canopy density based on turbulent-structure penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows over canopies of rigid elements with different geometries and Reynolds numbers (Re) are investigated to identify and characterise different canopy density regimes. In the sparse regime, turbulence penetrates relatively unhindered within the canopy, whereas in the dense regime, the penetration is limited. A common measure of canopy density is the ratio of frontal to bed area, the frontal density $\lambda_f$. This is effective for canopies with no preferential orientation, but we observe that it does not accurately predict the density regime for less conventional ones, so it may not encapsulate the governing physics. Instead, we propose density metrics based on the position and extent of eddies of intense Reynolds shear stress. We analyse a series of direct simulations for isotropic and anisotropic layouts, across a range of $\lambda_f$, height, element width-to-pitch ratio and Re. Canopies with streamwise-packed elements but large spanwise gaps allow significant turbulence penetration, and appear sparse compared to isotropic or spanwise-packed canopies with the same $\lambda_f$. Turbulence penetration depends essentially on the spanwise gap, and increases with it, but depends also on Re. A canopy can behave as dense at low Re, but as sparser as Re increases. This suggests that turbulence penetration depends on the size of the spanwise gap relative to the typical width of the overlying eddies. Turbulence penetrates easily when the spanwise gap is larger than the eddy size, and is essentially precluded from penetrating in the opposite case. A penetration length can then be defined that is of the order of the spanwise gap or the eddy size, whichever is smaller. If the penetration length is small compared to the canopy height, the canopy behaves as dense; if it is comparable, as intermediate; and if it is roughly equal or larger, as sparse.</description>

      <title>'Mic drop': on estimating the size of sub-mm droplets using a simple condenser microphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size distribution of aerosol droplets is a key parameter in a myriad of processes, and it is typically measured with optical aids (e.g., lasers or cameras) that require sophisticated calibration, thus making the measurement cost intensive. We developed a new method to indirectly measure the size of small droplets using off-the-shelf &lt;\$1 electret microphones. In this method we exploit the natural oscillations that small droplets undergo after impacting a flat surface: by allowing droplets to land directly on a microphone diaphragm, we record the impact force they exert onto it and calculate the complex resonant frequencies of oscillations, from which their size can be inferred. To test this method, we recorded the impact signals of droplets of varying sizes and extracted the resonant frequencies that characterize each signal. Various sources of uncertainty in the experiments led to a range of frequencies that can characterize each droplet size, and hence a data-driven approach was taken to estimate the size from each set of measured frequencies. We employed a simple setting of neural network and trained it on the frequencies we measured from impact of droplets of prescribed radius. The network was then able to predict the droplet radius in the test group with an average relative error of 2.7\% and a maximum of 8.6\%. These results, achieved with a data set of only 320 measurements, demonstrate the potential for reliable size-distribution measurements via a simple and inexpensive method.</description>

      <title>General-domain FC-based shock-dynamics solver II: Non-smooth domains, accuracy and parallel performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution Part II of a two-part series, extends the general-domain FC-SDNN (Fourier Continuation Shock-Detecting Neural Network) introduces in Part I to enable treatment of non-smooth domains, it introduces a parallel implementation of the scheme with high-quality weak and strong scalability properties, and it illustrates the overall methodology for a variety of tests for the 2D Euler equations--including supersonic and hypersonic flows and shocks past obstacles with corners. The results produces by the new methods are compared to previous theoretical and experimental results, and the high parallel scalability of the algorithm is demonstrated in both weak and strong scaling cases. Thanks to its use of a localized yet smooth artificial viscosity term--whose support is confined to regions near flow discontinuities identified by an artificial neural network--the algorithm maintains minimal numerical dissipation away from discontinuities. Overall, the method delivers accurate, sharp resolution of shocks and contact discontinuities, while producing smooth numerical solutions in regular flow regions--as evidences by the near-complete absence of spurious oscillations in level-set contours, even under strong shocks and high-speed flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparing the dynamics of idealized squall lines between NWP and LES models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) models are used to simulate convective systems, such as squall lines, but with different purposes. NWP models aim for the most accurate weather forecasts, whereas LES models are typically used to advance our understanding of physical processes. Therefore, these types of models differ in their design. With increasing computer power, the domain sizes and resolutions of these models converge, which raises the question if the model results also converge. We investigated an idealized squall line with the NWP model ICON (ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic) and the LES model MicroHH. These models differ in their design, mainly because ICON solves the compressible equations on a triangular grid, while MicroHH solves the anelastic equations on a regular grid. The case setup, including resolution, domain size, boundary conditions, and microphysics scheme, is aligned between the models. The models simulate the same squall-line structure and circulation pattern in simulations with both warm and ice microphysics. However, there are quantitative differences with MicroHH having a more intense squall-line circulation than ICON at all resolutions (1 km, 500 m, and 250 m), mainly because MicroHH has less numerical diffusion. The magnitude of the differences is sensitive to the advection scheme and the resolution and less sensitive to the formulation of turbulent diffusion. The quantitative differences between the models across resolutions highlight the importance of model physics and numerics, whereas the good qualitative agreement gives confidence that insights from LES can be applied in NWP.</description>

      <title>Drop impact on a heated pre-wetted wall: deposition-on-crater splash regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of a liquid drop with high Reynolds and Weber numbers on a wet solid surface typically results in the emergence, rising, and expansion of a corona-like thin jet. This phenomenon is explained by the propagation of a kinematic discontinuity within the wall film. Conventional theories suggest that the corona-forming liquid jet comprises material from the impacting drop and wall film. In this study, the impact of a drop on a wall film is observed using a high-speed video system. Simultaneously, the distribution of the contact temperature at the substrate surface is measured with a high-speed infrared system. The results reveal that heat transfer predominantly occurs within the thin thermal boundary layers in the drop and substrate. Moreover, our experiments show that under our specific conditions, the drop deposits at the base of the crater while only the wall film produces the corona and splashes. Correspondingly, the secondary drops consist only of the heated material of the wall film. This regime has not been previously reported in the literature. The validated models for the diameter of the cold spot, the characteristic time, and the contact temperature developed in this study can be potentially useful for reliable modeling of spray cooling.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Elastic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence can lead to to increased flow resistance, mixing and heat transfer. Its control -- either suppression or promotion -- has significant potential, and there is a concerted ongoing effort by the community to improve our understanding. Here we explore the dynamics of uncertainty in elastic turbulence, inspired by an approach recently applied to inertial turbulence in Ge et al. (2023) \textit{J. Fluid Mech.} 977:A17. We derive equations for the evolution of uncertainty measures, yielding insight on uncertainty growth mechanisms. Through numerical experiments, we identify four regimes of uncertainty evolution, characterised by I) rapid transfer to large scales, with large scale growth rates of $\tau^{6}$ (where $\tau$ represents time), II) a dissipative reduction of uncertainty, III) exponential growth at all scales, and IV) saturation. These regimes are governed by the interplay between advective and polymeric contributions (which tend to increase uncertainty), viscous, relaxation and dissipation effects (which reduce uncertainty), and inertial contributions. In elastic turbulence, reducing Reynolds number increases uncertainty at short times, but does not significantly influence the growth of uncertainty at later times. At late times, the growth of uncertainty increases with Weissenberg number, with decreasing polymeric diffusivity, and with the logarithm of the maximum length scale, as large flow features adjust the balance of advective and relaxation effects. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of elastic turbulence, offering a new approach for the analysis of viscoelastic flow instabilities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optimals and their role in sustaining turbulence in channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</description>

      <title>Two-phase stratified MHD flows in wide rectangular ducts: analytical and numerical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of a non-conductive gas layer flowing concurrently with a conductive liquid on the two-phase flow characteristics in wide horizontal ducts under a constant vertical magnetic field. To this end, analytical solutions for the velocity profile and induced magnetic field are presented for laminar gas-liquid stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow between two infinite plates of various conductivities. The contributions of the Lorentz force and wall shear stresses to the pressure gradient are examined. To the best of our knowledge, it is shown for the first time that, unlike the single-phase Hartmann flow, the velocity profiles in two-phase flow differ significantly depending on whether the bottom wall is conducting or insulating. In the case of an insulating bottom wall, the gas lubrication effect and potential pumping power savings are significantly greater, regardless of the magnetic Reynolds number. This conclusion also holds for gas-liquid MHD flows in rectangular ducts with finite width-to-height aspect ratios. To assess the applicability of the Two-Plate (TP) model to wide ducts, numerical solutions of the two-dimensional problem are used to investigate the influence of side walls on the two-phase flow characteristics, considering various combinations of bottom and side wall conductivities. In all cases, the results for high aspect ratios converge to the analytical solution obtained from the TP model with the same bottom wall conductivity. However, the influence of insulating side walls remains significant even at large aspect ratios when the bottom wall is conducting. Unexpectedly, in such cases, the change in the induced magnetic field due to the presence of side walls has a dramatic effect on the velocity profile, leading to a reduced pressure gradient compared to that predicted by the TP model.</description>

      <title>When Cubic Law and Darcy Fail: Bayesian Correction of Model Misspecification in Fracture Conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural uncertainties and unresolved features in fault zones hinder the assessment of leakage risks in subsurface CO2 storage. Understanding multi-scale uncertainties in fracture network conductivity is crucial for mitigating risks and reliably modelling upscaled fault leakage rates. Conventional models, such as the Cubic Law, which is based on mechanical aperture measurements, often neglect fracture roughness, leading to model misspecifications and inaccurate conductivity estimates. Here, we develop a physics-informed, AI-driven correction of these model misspecifications by automatically integrating roughness effects and small-scale structural uncertainties. Using Bayesian inference combined with data-driven and geometric corrections, we reconstruct local hydraulic aperture fields that reliably estimate fracture conductivities. By leveraging interactions across scales, we improve upon traditional empirical corrections and provide a framework for propagating uncertainties from individual fractures to network scales. Our approach thereby supports robust calibration of conductivity ranges for fault leakage sensitivity analyses, offering a scalable solution for subsurface risk assessment.</description>
