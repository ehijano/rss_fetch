      <title>Functorial languages in homological algebra and the lower central series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This approach is based on the idea used to construct the so-called ${\bf fr}$-language. We construct such functorial languages as the ${\bf fr_{\infty}}$-language and other versions of it on categories of groups using the lower central series of groups of relations. In addition, we compute higher limits of the coinvariants of exterior powers, free Lie powers of modules of relations associated to free representations of groups. We show that such ${\bf fr_{\infty}}$-languages have remarkable properties when restricted to groups of finite homological dimension, torsion-free groups, and groups having no torsion up to $n$. Finally, we show how one can use functorial languages to transform categories/varieties of groups into certain spectra, which we call flux-spectra.</description>

      <title>On the K-theory of quantum projective spaces and of some AF algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study embeddings $E\to E\times E$ of a directed graph $E$ that induce a *-homomorphism $A\otimes A\to A$, where $A:=C^*(E)^{U(1)}$ is the core of the graph C*-algebra of $E$. Through the external product in K-theory, any such a *-homomorphism induces a ring structure on $K_*(A)$. Our main interest is the C*-algebras $A=C(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}_q)$ of a quantum projective space. For this C*-algebra, we give a direct proof of some identities in K-theory that classically follow from the ring structure of $K^0(\mathbb{C}P^{n-1})$. The proof of these identities is based on graph C*-algebras and is alternative to the one by Arici, Brain and Landi using index theory, and to the one by the author, Hajac, Maszczyk, Sheu and Zielinski using groupoid C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Syntomic cohomology of Morava K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the MU-based syntomic cohomologies, mod $(p,v_1,\cdots,v_{n+1})$, of all $\mathbb{E}_1$-MU-algebra forms of connective Morava K-theory k(n). As qualitative consequences, we deduce the Lichtenbaum--Quillen conjecture, telescope conjecture, and redshift conjecture for the algebraic K-theories of all $\mathbb{E}_{1}$-$\mathbb{S}$-algebra forms of $(2p^n-2)$-periodic Morava K-theory. Notably, the motivic spectral sequence computing $\pi_*TC(k(n))_p$ is concentrated on at most three lines, independently of $n$.</description>

      <title>On the $K$-theory of the $p$-adic unit disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the $p$-complete topological cyclic homology of the affine line relative to a ring $A$ which is smooth over a perfectoid ring $R$. Denoting by $NTC(A; \mathbb{Z}_p)$ the spectrum which measures the failure of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance on $A$, we observe a kind of Quillen-Lichtenbaum phenomena for $NTC(A; \mathbb{Z}_p)$ -- that it is isomorphic to its own $K(1)$-localization in a specified range of degrees which depends on the relative dimension of $A$. Somewhat surprisingly, this range is better than considerations following from a theorem of Bhatt-Mathew and \'etale-to-syntomic comparisons. Via the Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy theorem, we obtain a description of the algebraic $K$-theory of $p$-completed affine line over such rings.</description>

      <title>Equivariant aspects of de-completing cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derived de Rham cohomology turns out to be important in p-adic geometry, following Bhatt's discovery [Bha12] of conjugate filtration in char p, de-Hodge-completing results in [Bei12]. In [Kal18], Kaledin introduced an analogous de-completion of the periodic cyclic homology, called the polynomial periodic cyclic homology, equipped with a conjugate filtration in char p, and expected to be related to derived de Rham cohomology. In this article, using genuine equivariant homotopy structure on Hochschild homology as in [ABG+18, BHM22], we give an equivariant description of Kaledin's polynomial periodic cyclic homology. This leads to Morita invariance without any Noetherianness assumption as in [Kal18], and the comparison to derived de Rham cohomology becomes transparent. Moreover, this description adapts directly to "topological" analogues, which gives rise to a de-Nygaard-completion of the topological periodic cyclic homology over a perfectoid base. We compare it to topological Hochschild homology over $\mathbb F_p$, and produce a conjugate filtration in char p from our description.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative relative de Rham--Witt complex via the norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [Ill79], Illusie constructed de Rham-Witt complex of smooth $\mathbb F_p$-algebras R, which computes the crystalline cohomology of R, a $\mathbb Z_p$-lift of the de Rham cohomology of R. There are two different extensions of de Rham-Witt complex: a relative version discovered by Langer-Zink, and a noncommutative version, called Hochschild-Witt homology, constructed by Kaledin. The key to Kaledin's construction is his polynomial Witt vectors. In this article, we introduce a common extension of both: relative Hochschild-Witt homology. It is simply defined to be topological Hochschild homology relative to the Tambara functor $W(\mathbb F_p)$. Adopting Hesselholt's proof of his HKR theorem, we deduce an HKR theorem for relative Hochschild-Witt homology, which relates its homology groups to relative de Rham-Witt complex. We also identify Kaledin's polynomial Witt vectors as the relative Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm, which allows us to identify our Hochschild-Witt homology relative to $\mathbb F_p$ with Kaledin's Hochschild-Witt homology. As a consequence, we deduce a comparison between Hochschild-Witt homology and topological restriction homology, fulfilling a missing part of [Kal19].</description>

      <title>Localization problems of Quillen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a quasi projective scheme over a noetherian affine scheme $Spec(A)$, $U\subseteq X$ be an open subset, and $Z=X-U$.Assume that $Z$ is complete intersection, with $k=codim Z$. Consider the map
  $$
  q:{\mathbb K}\left({\mathscr V}(X)\right) \rightarrow {\mathbb K}\left({\mathscr V}(U)\right)
  $$
  of the ${\mathbb K}$-theory spectra. We give a description of the homotopy fiber of $q$.
  Let $C{\mathbb M}^Z\left(X\right)$ denote the full subcategory of perfect modules ${\mathscr F} \in Coh(X)$ such that(1) ${\mathscr F} _{|U}=0$, (2) $grade({\mathscr F} )=\dim_{{\mathscr V}(X)}{\mathscr F}=k $. It turns out that the homotopy fiber of $q$ is the ${\mathbb K}$-theory spectra
  ${\mathbb K}\left(C{\mathbb M}^Z\left(X\right)\right)$.
  Likewise, we compute the homotopy fiber of the pullback map
  $$
  g: {\mathbb G}W\left({\mathscr V}(X)\right) \rightarrow {\mathbb G}W\left({\mathscr V}(U)\right)
  $$
  of Karoubi Grothendieck-Witt bispectra. Consequently, we obtain long exact sequences of ${\mathbb K}$-groups and of ${\mathbb G}W$-groups. These results settle some of the long standing open problems. We also inserted a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Finite group actions on dg categories and Hochschild homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a decomposition of the Hochschild homology groups of the equivariant dg category $\mathscr{C}^G$ associated to a small dg category $\mathscr{C}$ with direct sums on which a finite group $G$ acts. When the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ this decomposition is related to a categorical action of $\text{Rep}(G)$ on $\mathscr{C}^G$ and the resulting action of the representation ring $R_\mathbb{C}(G)$ on $HH_\bullet(\mathscr{C}^G)$.</description>

      <title>Entropy, cocycles, and their diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first part of the paper explains how to encode a one-cocycle and a two-cocycle on a group $G$ with values in its representation by networks of planar trivalent graphs with edges labelled by elements of $G$, elements of the representation floating in the regions, and suitable rules for manipulation of these diagrams. When the group is a semidirect product, there is a similar presentation via overlapping networks for the two subgroups involved.
  M. Kontsevich and J.-L. Cathelineau have shown how to interpret the entropy of a finite random variable and infinitesimal dilogarithms, including their four-term functional relations, via 2-cocycles on the group of affine symmetries of a line.
  We convert their construction into a diagrammatical calculus evaluating planar networks that describe morphisms in suitable monoidal categories. In particular, the four-term relations become equalities of networks analogous to associativity equations. The resulting monoidal categories complement existing categorical and operadic approaches to entropy.</description>

      <title>Generalized cohomology theories for algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the stable motivic homotopy category of Voevodsky to the class of scalloped algebraic stacks, and show that it admits the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations. Objects in this category represent generalized cohomology theories for stacks like algebraic K-theory, as well as new examples like genuine motivic cohomology and algebraic cobordism. These cohomology theories admit Gysin maps and satisfy homotopy invariance, localization, and Mayer-Vietoris. For example, we deduce that homotopy K-theory satisfies cdh descent on scalloped stacks. We also prove a fixed point localization formula for torus actions.
  Finally, the construction is contrasted with a "lisse-extended" stable motivic homotopy category, defined for arbitrary stacks: we show for example that lisse-extended motivic cohomology of quotient stacks is computed by the equivariant higher Chow groups of Edidin-Graham, and we also get a good new theory of Borel-equivariant algebraic cobordism. Moreover, the lisse-extended motivic homotopy type is shown to recover all previous constructions of motives of stacks.</description>
