      <title>Learning-based geometric shape optimization of the Dirichlet energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in $\mathbb R^2$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.</description>

      <title>Application of the Lov\'asz-Schrijver Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz theta function $\theta(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $\theta(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lov\'asz and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $\theta(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $\theta(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Small-Gain Theorem Based Distributed Prescribed-Time Convex Optimization For Networked Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed prescribed-time convex optimization (DPTCO) for a class of networked Euler-Lagrange systems under undirected connected graphs. By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient value of local objective function and local information interactions among neighboring agents, a set of auxiliary systems is constructed to cooperatively seek the optimal solution. The DPTCO problem is then converted to the prescribed-time stabilization problem of an interconnected error system. A prescribed-time small-gain criterion is proposed to characterize prescribed-time stabilization of the system, offering a novel approach that enhances the effectiveness beyond existing asymptotic or finite-time stabilization of an interconnected system. Under the criterion and auxiliary systems, innovative adaptive prescribed-time local tracking controllers are designed for subsystems. The prescribed-time convergence lies in the introduction of time-varying gains which increase to infinity as time tends to the prescribed time. Lyapunov function together with prescribed-time mapping are used to prove the prescribed-time stability of closed-loop system as well as the boundedness of internal signals. Finally, theoretical results are verified by one numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the theoretical and numerical analysis of the null controllability of a coupled ODE-heat system internally and at the boundary with Neumann boundary control. First, we establish the null controllability of the ODE-heat with distributed control using Carleman estimates. Then, we conclude by the strategy of space domain extension. Finally, we illustrate the analysis with some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization via Quadratic Disjunctive Programming for Water Networks Design with Energy Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) models with bilinear and concave constraints, often seen in water network design, are challenging optimization problems. This work proposes quadratic and piecewise linear approximations for nonlinear terms to reformulate GDP models into quadratic GDP (QGDP) models that suitable solvers may solve more efficiently. We illustrate the benefits of the quadratic reformulation with a water treatment network design problem in which nonconvexities arise from bilinear terms in the mixers' mass balances and concave investment cost functions of treatment units. Given the similarities with water network design problems, we suggest quadratic approximation for the GDP model for the optimal design of a large-scale reverse electrodialysis (RED) process. This power technology can recover energy from salinity differences between by-product streams of the water sector, such as desalination brine mixed with regenerated wastewater effluents. The solver Gurobi excels in handling QGDP problems, but weighing the problem's precision and tractability balance is crucial. The piecewise linear approximation yields more accurate, yet larger QGDP models that may require longer optimization times in large-scale process synthesis problems.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Smoothing Rugged Landscape by Different Toy Problems: A Case Study on UBQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP, including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1") exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3 (construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective, while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in optimizing UBQP.</description>

      <title>PDOT: a Practical Primal-Dual Algorithm and a GPU-Based Solver for Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a practical primal-dual algorithm with theoretical guarantees and develop a GPU-based solver, which we dub PDOT, for solving large-scale optimal transport problems. Compared to Sinkhorn algorithm or classic LP algorithms, PDOT can achieve high-accuracy solution while efficiently taking advantage of modern computing architecture, i.e., GPUs. On the theoretical side, we show that PDOT has a data-independent $\widetilde O(mn(m+n)^{1.5}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ local flop complexity where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy, and $m$ and $n$ are the dimension of the original and target distribution, respectively. We further present a data-dependent $\widetilde O(mn(m+n)^{3.5}\Delta + mn(m+n)^{1.5}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ global flop complexity of PDOT, where $\Delta$ is the precision of the data. On the numerical side, we present PDOT, an open-source GPU solver based on the proposed algorithm. Our extensive numerical experiments consistently demonstrate the well balance of PDOT in computing efficiency and accuracy of the solution, compared to Gurobi and Sinkhorn algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Semi-definite Optimization Method for Maximizing the Shared Band Gap of Topological Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonic crystals (PCs) can support robust edge modes to transport electromagnetic energy in an efficient manner. Such edge modes are the eigenmodes of the PDE operator for a joint optical structure formed by connecting together two photonic crystals with distinct topological invariants, and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are located in the shared band gap of two individual photonic crystals. This work is concerned with maximizing the shared band gap of two photonic crystals with different topological features in order to increase the bandwidth of the edge modes. We develop a semi-definite optimization framework for the underlying optimal design problem, which enables efficient update of dielectric functions at each time step while respecting symmetry constraints and, when necessary, the constraints on topological invariants. At each iteration, we perform sensitivity analysis of the band gap function and the topological invariant constraint function to linearize the optimization problem and solve a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem efficiently. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is superior in generating optimized optical structures with robust edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking is an emerging area with the potential to transform information processing and communications. In this paper, we present a brief introduction to quantum network control, an area in quantum networking dedicated to designing algorithms for distributing entanglement (i.e., entangled qubits). We start by explaining what qubits and entanglement are and how they furnish quantum network control operations such as entanglement swapping and teleportation. With those operations, we present a model for distributing entanglement in a multi-hop quantum network to enable applications such as quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. We conclude the paper by presenting open research problems in the field, including the characterization of the quantum network capacity region and the design of throughput-optimal policies.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of the Quantum Switch with and without Entanglement Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the capacity of the quantum switch for two decoherence models: when link-level entanglements last (i) for a time slot, or (ii) until they are used to serve a request (i.e., there is no decoherence). The two models are important as they set lower and upper bounds on the capacity region for any other decoherence model. The paper's contributions are to characterize the switch capacity region for both decoherence models and to propose throughput-optimal policies based on gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Battery Storage On the Energy Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity storage is crucial for a successful transition towards carbon-neutral energy production. Despite considerable research and a number of promising future alternatives such as hydrogen, battery storages currently remain the first choice. However, costs remain high and it remains to be shown whether an investment can be profitable. This article addresses this question by modelling a battery storage operating in the German power market. We consider two periods with very distinct price dynamics, namely a calm year (2020) and a turbulent year (2023). It shows that even for low battery costs a 2020 style price environment does not allow for profitable battery operation, whereas current market conditions allow for positive payoffs.</description>

      <title>Barrier Functions for Switched and Impulsive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems occurring in real-world applications, such as controlling the motions of robots or modeling the spread of diseases, are switched impulsive systems. To ensure that the system state stays in a safe region (e.g., to avoid collisions with obstacles), barrier functions are widely utilized. As the system dimension increases, deriving suitable barrier functions becomes extremely complex. Fortunately, many systems consist of multiple subsystems, such as different areas where the disease occurs. In this work, we present sufficient conditions for interconnected switched impulsive systems to maintain safety by constructing local barrier functions for the individual subsystems instead of a global one, allowing for much easier and more efficient derivation. To validate our results, we numerically demonstrate its effectiveness using an epidemiological model.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Guarantees for Best-Response Learning Dynamics in Zero-Sum Matrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study best-response type learning dynamics for two player zero-sum matrix games. We consider two settings that are distinguished by the type of information that each player has about the game and their opponent's strategy. The first setting is the full information case, in which each player knows their own and the opponent's payoff matrices and observes the opponent's mixed strategy. The second setting is the minimal information case, where players do not observe the opponent's strategy and are not aware of either of the payoff matrices (instead they only observe their realized payoffs). For this setting, also known as the radically uncoupled case in the learning in games literature, we study a two-timescale learning dynamics that combine smoothed best-response type updates for strategy estimates with a TD-learning update to estimate a local payoff function. For these dynamics, without additional exploration, we provide polynomial-time finite-sample guarantees for convergence to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Solving QUBOs with a quantum-amenable branch and bound method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the expected disparity in quantum vs. classical clock speeds, quantum advantage for branch and bound algorithms is more likely achievable in settings involving large search trees and low operator evaluation costs. Therefore, in this paper, we describe and experimentally validate an exact classical branch and bound solver for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems that matches these criteria. Our solver leverages cheap-to-implement bounds from the literature previously proposed for Ising models, including that of Hartwig, Daske, and Kobe from 1984. We detail a variety of techniques from high-performance computing and operations research used to boost solver performance, including a global variable reordering heuristic, a primal heuristic based on simulated annealing, and a truncated computation of the recursive bound. We also outline a number of simple and inexpensive bound extrapolation techniques. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of our solver, comparing its performance to state-of-the-art QUBO and MaxCut solvers, and discuss the challenges of a speedup via quantum branch and bound beyond those faced by any quadratic quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient Splitting Methods for Convex-Concave Saddle-Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based a novel primal-dual dynamical model with adaptive scaling parameters and Bregman divergences, we propose new accelerated primal-dual proximal gradient splitting methods for solving bilinear saddle-point problems with provable optimal nonergodic convergence rates. For the first, using the spectral analysis, we show that a naive extension of acceleration model for unconstrained optimization problems to a quadratic game is unstable. Motivated by this, we present an accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (APDHG) flow which combines acceleration with careful velocity correction. To work with non-Euclidean distances, we also equip our APDHG model with general Bregman divergences and prove the exponential decay of a Lyapunov function. Then, new primal-dual splitting methods are developed based on proper semi-implicit Euler schemes of the continuous model, and the theoretical convergence rates are nonergodic and optimal with respect to the matrix norms,\, Lipschitz constants and convexity parameters. Thanks to the primal and dual scaling parameters, both the algorithm designing and convergence analysis cover automatically the convex and (partially) strongly convex objectives. Moreover, the use of Bregman divergences not only unifies the standard Euclidean distances and general cases in an elegant way, but also makes our methods more flexible and adaptive to problem-dependent metrics.</description>

      <title>The generator gradient estimator is an adjoint state method for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing popularity of overparameterized Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) like Neural SDEs, Wang, Blanchet and Glynn recently introduced the generator gradient estimator, a novel unbiased stochastic gradient estimator for SDEs whose computation time remains stable in the number of parameters. In this note, we demonstrate that this estimator is in fact an adjoint state method, an approach which is known to scale with the number of states and not the number of parameters in the case of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). In addition, we show that the generator gradient estimator is a close analogue to the exact Integral Path Algorithm (eIPA) estimator which was introduced by Gupta, Rathinam and Khammash for a class of Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) known as stochastic chemical reactions networks (CRNs).</description>

Abstract: Some sum of squares (SOS) polynomials admit decomposition certificates, or positive semidefinite Gram matrices, with additional structure. In this work, we use the structure of Gram matrices to relate the representation theory of $SL(2)$ to $SO(2)$. Informally, we prove that if $p$ is a sum of squares and lives in some of the invariant subspaces of $SO(2)$, then it has a positive semidefinite Gram matrix that lives in certain invariant subspaces of $SL(2)$. The tools used in the proof construction are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Investigation of discontinuous Galerkin methods in adjoint gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a robust and efficient framework of the adjoint gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) using high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods (DGMs) as the CFD solver. The adjoint-enabled gradients based on different CFD solvers or solution representations are derived in detail, and the potential advantage of DG representations is discovered that the adjoint gradient computed by the DGMs contains a modification term which implies information of higher-order moments of the solution as compared with finite volume methods (FVMs). A number of numerical cases are tested for investigating the impact of different CFD solvers (including DGMs and FVMs) on the evaluation of the adjoint-enabled gradients. The numerical results demonstrate that the DGMs can provide more precise adjoint gradients even on a coarse mesh as compared with the FVMs under coequal computational costs, and extend the capability to explore the design space, further leading to acquiring the aerodynamic shapes with more superior aerodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Partial Identification of the Average Treatment Effect with Stochastic Counterfactuals and Discordant Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to partially identify causal estimands, such as the average treatment effect (ATE), from observational data. To better satisfy the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) we utilize stochastic counterfactuals within a propensity-prognosis model of the data generating process. For more precise identification we utilize knowledge of discordant twin outcomes as evidence for randomness in the data generating process. Our approach culminates with a constrained optimization problem; the solution gives upper and lower bounds for the ATE. We demonstrate the applicability of our introduced methodology with three example applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis for a Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization Problem in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a fully discrete approximation for a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem (P) with applications in acoustic full waveform inversion. The optimization problem is primarily complicated by the hyperbolic character and the second-order bilinear structure in the governing wave equation. While the control parameter is discretized using the piecewise constant elements, the state discretization is realized through an auxiliary first-order system along with the leapfrog time-stepping method and continuous piecewise linear elements. The resulting fully discrete minimization problem ($\text{P}_h$) is shown to be well-defined. Furthermore, building upon a suitable CFL-condition, we prove stability and uniform convergence of the state discretization. Our final result is the strong convergence result for ($\text{P}_h$) in the following sense: Given a local minimizer $\overline \nu$ of (P) satisfying a reasonable growth condition, there exists a sequence of local minimizers of ($\text{P}_h$) converging strongly towards $\overline \nu$.</description>

Abstract: We establish novel quantitative stability results for optimal transport problems with respect to perturbations in the target measure. We provide explicit bounds on the stability of optimal transport potentials and maps, which are relevant for both theoretical and practical applications. Our results apply to a wide range of costs, including all Wasserstein distances with power cost exponent strictly larger than $1$ and leverage mostly assumptions on the source measure, such as log-concavity and bounded support. Our work provides a significant step forward in the understanding of stability of optimal transport problems, as previous results where mostly limited to the case of the quadratic cost.</description>

      <title>FIARSE: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Importance-Aware Submodel Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), accommodating clients' varied computational capacities poses a challenge, often limiting the participation of those with constrained resources in global model training. To address this issue, the concept of model heterogeneity through submodel extraction has emerged, offering a tailored solution that aligns the model's complexity with each client's computational capacity. In this work, we propose Federated Importance-Aware Submodel Extraction (FIARSE), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts submodels based on the importance of model parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of previous static and dynamic submodel extraction methods. Compared to existing works, the proposed method offers a theoretical foundation for the submodel extraction and eliminates the need for additional information beyond the model parameters themselves to determine parameter importance, significantly reducing the overhead on clients. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets to showcase superior performance of the proposed FIARSE.</description>

      <title>Near-Isotropic Sub-{\AA}ngstrom 3D Resolution Phase Contrast Imaging Achieved by End-to-End Ptychographic Electron Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional atomic resolution imaging using transmission electron microscopes is a unique capability that requires challenging experiments. Linear electron tomography methods are limited by the missing wedge effect, requiring a high tilt range. Multislice ptychography can achieve deep sub-{\AA}ngstrom resolution in the transverse direction, but the depth resolution is limited to 2 to 3 nanometers. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an end-to-end approach to reconstructing the electrostatic potential volume of the sample directly from the 4D-STEM datasets. End-to-end multi-slice ptychographic tomography recovers several slices at each tomography tilt angle and compensates for the missing wedge effect. The algorithm is initially tested in simulation with a Pt@$\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ core-shell nanoparticle, where both heavy and light atoms are recovered in 3D from an unaligned 4D-STEM tilt series with a restricted tilt range of 90 degrees. We also demonstrate the algorithm experimentally, recovering a Te nanoparticle with sub-{\AA}ngstrom resolution.</description>

Abstract: Based on Welzl's algorithm for smallest circles and spheres we develop a simple linear time algorithm for finding the smallest circle enclosing a point cloud on a sphere. The algorithm yields correct results as long as the point cloud is contained in a hemisphere, but the hemisphere does not have to be known in advance and the algorithm automatically detects whether the hemisphere assumption is met.
  For the full-sphere case, that is, if the point cloud is not contained in a hemisphere, we provide hints on how to adapt existing linearithmic time algorithms for spherical Voronoi diagrams to find the smallest enclosing circle.</description>

      <title>A Differential Dynamic Programming Framework for Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A differential dynamic programming (DDP)-based framework for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is introduced to recover the parameters in the cost function, system dynamics, and constraints from demonstrations. Different from existing work, where DDP was used for the inner forward problem with inequality constraints, our proposed framework uses it for efficient computation of the gradient required in the outer inverse problem with equality and inequality constraints. The equivalence between the proposed method and existing methods based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) is established. More importantly, using this DDP-based IRL with an open-loop loss function, a closed-loop IRL framework is presented. In this framework, a loss function is proposed to capture the closed-loop nature of demonstrations. It is shown to be better than the commonly used open-loop loss function. We show that the closed-loop IRL framework reduces to a constrained inverse optimal control problem under certain assumptions. Under these assumptions and a rank condition, it is proven that the learning parameters can be recovered from the demonstration data. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated through four numerical robot examples and one real-world quadrotor system. The experiments validate the theoretical results and illustrate the practical relevance of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In portfolio optimization, decision makers face difficulties from uncertainties inherent in real-world scenarios. These uncertainties significantly influence portfolio outcomes in both classical and multi-objective Markowitz models. To address these challenges, our research explores the power of robust multi-objective optimization. Since portfolio managers frequently measure their solutions against benchmarks, we enhance the multi-objective min-regret robustness concept by incorporating these benchmark comparisons.
  This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world investment scenarios, offering portfolio managers more reliable and adaptable strategies for navigating market uncertainties. Our framework provides a more nuanced and practical approach to portfolio optimization under real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>JAX-SSO: Differentiable Finite Element Analysis Solver for Structural Optimization and Seamless Integration with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable numerical simulations of physical systems have gained rising attention in the past few years with the development of automatic differentiation tools. This paper presents JAX-SSO, a differentiable finite element analysis solver built with JAX, Google's high-performance computing library, to assist efficient structural design in the built environment. With the adjoint method and automatic differentiation feature, JAX-SSO can efficiently evaluate gradients of physical quantities in an automatic way, enabling accurate sensitivity calculation in structural optimization problems. Written in Python and JAX, JAX-SSO is naturally within the machine learning ecosystem so it can be seamlessly integrated with neural networks to train machine learning models with inclusion of physics. Moreover, JAX-SSO supports GPU acceleration to further boost finite element analysis. Several examples are presented to showcase the capabilities and efficiency of JAX-SSO: i) shape optimization of grid-shells and continuous shells; ii) size (thickness) optimization of continuous shells; iii) simultaneous shape and topology optimization of continuous shells; and iv) training of physics-informed neural networks for structural optimization. We believe that JAX-SSO can facilitate research related to differentiable physics and machine learning to further address problems in structural and architectural design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20218v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging the 6D phase space of a beam in a particle accelerator in a single shot is currently impossible. Single shot beam measurements only exist for certain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual diagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space would be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a generative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual diagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is developed. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar parameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector representation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that conditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15 of the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the HiRES compact accelerator.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Gradient Descent with Varying Step Sizes using Integral Quadratic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) is used to perform an analysis of gradient descent with varying step sizes. Two performance metrics are considered: convergence rate and noise amplification. We assume that the step size is produced from a line search and varies in a known interval. Modeling the algorithm as a linear, parameter-varying (LPV) system, we construct a parameterized linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition that certifies algorithm performance, which is solved using a result for polytopic LPV systems. Our results provide convergence rate guarantees when the step size lies within a restricted interval. Moreover, we recover existing rate bounds when this interval reduces to a single point, i.e. a constant step size. Finally, we note that the convergence rate depends only on the condition number of the problem. In contrast, the noise amplification performance depends on the individual values of the strong convexity and smoothness parameters, and varies inversely with them for a fixed condition number.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Monge maps for the Gromov-Wasserstein problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein problem is a non-convex optimization problem over the polytope of transportation plans between two probability measures supported on two spaces, each equipped with a cost function evaluating similarities between points. Akin to the standard optimal transportation problem, it is natural to ask for conditions guaranteeing some structure on the optimizers, for instance if these are induced by a (Monge) map. We study this question in Euclidean spaces when the cost functions are either given by (i) inner products or (ii) squared distances, two standard choices in the literature. We establish the existence of an optimal map in case (i) and of an optimal 2-map (the union of the graphs of two maps) in case (ii), both under an absolute continuity condition on the source measure. Additionally, in case (ii) and in dimension one, we numerically design situations where optimizers of the Gromov--Wasserstein problem are 2-maps but are not maps. This suggests that our result cannot be improved in general for this cost. Still in dimension one, we additionally establish the optimality of monotone maps under some conditions on the measures, thereby giving insight on why such maps often appear to be optimal in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The ADMM-PINNs Algorithmic Framework for Nonsmooth PDE-Constrained Optimization: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the combination of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for a general class of nonsmooth partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization problems, where additional regularization can be employed for constraints on the control or design variables. The resulting ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework substantially enlarges the applicable range of PINNs to nonsmooth cases of PDE-constrained optimization problems. The application of the ADMM makes it possible to untie the PDE constraints and the nonsmooth regularization terms for iterations. Accordingly, at each iteration, one of the resulting subproblems is a smooth PDE-constrained optimization which can be efficiently solved by PINNs, and the other is a simple nonsmooth optimization problem which usually has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved by various standard optimization algorithms or pre-trained neural networks. The ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework does not require to solve PDEs repeatedly, and it is mesh-free, easy to implement, and scalable to different PDE settings. We validate the efficiency of the ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework by different prototype applications, including inverse potential problems, source identification in elliptic equations, control constrained optimal control of the Burgers equation, and sparse optimal control of parabolic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convex hulls of reachable sets of nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances and uncertain initial conditions. Reachable sets play a critical role in control, but remain notoriously challenging to compute, and existing over-approximation tools tend to be conservative or computationally expensive. In this work, we characterize the convex hulls of reachable sets as the convex hulls of solutions of an ordinary differential equation with initial conditions on the sphere. This finite-dimensional characterization unlocks an efficient sampling-based estimation algorithm to accurately over-approximate reachable sets. We also study the structure of the boundary of the reachable convex hulls and derive error bounds for the estimation algorithm. We give applications to neural feedback loop analysis and robust MPC.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization: A Contraction and Equilibrium Tracking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a novel and broadly-applicable contraction-theoretic approach to continuous-time time-varying convex optimization. For any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics, we show that the tracking error is asymptotically proportional to the rate of change of the parameter with proportionality constant upper bounded by Lipschitz constant in which the parameter appears divided by the contraction rate of the dynamics squared. We additionally establish that any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics can be augmented with a feedforward prediction term to ensure that the tracking error converges to zero exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization problems, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems, namely monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each of these problems, we prove the sharpest-known rates of contraction and provide explicit tracking error bounds between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories. We validate our theoretical results on three numerical examples including an application to control-barrier function based controller design.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Multi-Agent Patrolling with State-Dependent Cost Rates -- Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a large-scale patrol problem with state-dependent costs and multi-agent coordination.We consider heterogeneous agents, rather general reward functions, and the capabilities of tracking agents' trajectories.Given the complexity and uncertainty of the practical situations for patrolling, we model the problem as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) that consists of a large number of parallel stochastic processes.We aim to minimize the cumulative patrolling cost over a finite time horizon.The problem exhibits an excessively large size of state space, which increases exponentially in the number of agents and the size of geographical region for patrolling.To reach practical solutions, we relax the dependencies between these parallel stochastic processes by randomizing all the state and action variables.In this context, the entire problem can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems, each of which has a much smaller state space and can be solved independently. The solutions of these sub-problems can lead to efficient heuristics.Unlike the past systems assuming relatively simple structure of the underlying stochastic process, here, tracking the patrol trajectories involves strong dependencies between the stochastic processes, leading to entirely different state and action spaces, transition kernels, and behaviours of processes,rendering the existing methods inapplicable or impractical.Further more, we prove that the performance deviation between the proposed policies and the possible optimal solution diminishes exponentially in the problem size, which also establishes the fact that the policies converge asymptotically at an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>On derivative-free sample-and-hold control with prescribed performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A feedback controller is proposed to perform output reference tracking with prescribed performance for nonlinear continuous-time systems of relative degree two. The controller is of sampled-data type, i.e., measurements are available only at sampling times - a typical situation in real systems when sensors are involved. Furthermore, only output information is available, i.e., neither the full state nor derivatives can be used for feedback. A sufficient uniform sampling rate is derived and the control consists of piecewise constant signals on the sampling intervals, i.e., zero-order hold. Feasibility of the controller and satisfaction of the control objective are rigorously proven. The controller is illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-component data-driven controller to safely perform docking maneuvers for satellites. Reinforcement Learning is used to deduce an optimal control policy based on measurement data. To safeguard the learning phase, an additional feedback law is implemented in the control unit, which guarantees the evolution of the system within predefined performance bounds. We define safe and safety-critical areas to train the feedback controller based on actual measurements. To avoid chattering, a dwell-time activation scheme is implemented. We provide numerical evidence for the performance of the proposed controller for a satellite docking maneuver with collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Edge expansion of a graph: SDP-based computational strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the edge expansion of a graph is a famously hard combinatorial problem for which there have been many approximation studies. We present two variants of exact algorithms using semidefinite programming (SDP) to compute this constant for any graph. The first variant uses the SDP relaxation first to reduce the search space considerably. One implementation of this variant applies then an SDP-based branch-and-bound algorithm, along with heuristic search. The second implementation transforms the problem into an instance of a max-cut problem and solves this using an SDP-based state-of-the-art solver. Our second variant to compute the edge expansion uses Dinkelbach's algorithm for fractional programming. This is, we have to solve a parametrized optimization problem and again we use semidefinite programming to obtain solutions of the parametrized problems. Numerical results demonstrate that with our algorithms one can compute the edge expansion on graphs up to 400 vertices in a routine way, including instances where standard branch-and-cut solvers fail. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first SDP-based solvers for computing the edge expansion of a graph.</description>

      <title>A Low-Rank ADMM Splitting Approach for Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new first-order method for solving general semidefinite programming problems, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and a matrix-splitting technique. Our algorithm has an advantage over the Burer-Monteiro approach as it only involves much easier quadratically regularized subproblems in each iteration. For a linear objective, the subproblems are well-conditioned quadratic programs that can be efficiently solved by the standard conjugate gradient method. We show that the ADMM algorithm achieves sublinear or linear convergence rates to the KKT solutions under different conditions. Building on this theoretical development, we present LoRADS, a new solver for linear SDP based on the Low-Rank ADMM Splitting approach. LoRADS incorporates several strategies that significantly increase its efficiency. Firstly, it initiates with a warm-start phase that uses the Burer-Monteiro approach. Moreover, motivated by the SDP low-rank theory [So et al. 2008], LoRADS chooses an initial rank of logarithmic order and then employs a dynamic approach to increase the rank. Numerical experiments indicate that LoRADS exhibits promising performance on various SDP problems. A noteworthy achievement of LoRADS is its successful solving of a matrix completion problem with $15,694,167$ constraints and a matrix variable of size $40,000 \times 40,000$ in $351$ seconds.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Regularized Proximal Newton-Type Methods for Composite Optimization over the Stiefel Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the proximal Newton-type method and its variants have been generalized to solve composite optimization problems over the Stiefel manifold whose objective function is the summation of a smooth function and a nonsmooth function. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quadratically regularized proximal quasi-Newton method, named ARPQN, to solve this class of problems. Under some mild assumptions, the global convergence, the local linear convergence rate and the iteration complexity of ARPQN are established. Numerical experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods indicate that ARPQN is very promising. We also propose an adaptive quadratically regularized proximal Newton method, named ARPN. It is shown the ARPN method has a local superlinear convergence rate under certain reasonable assumptions, which demonstrates attractive convergence properties of regularized proximal Newton methods.</description>

      <title>On Bias and Its Reduction via Standardization in Discretized Electromagnetic Source Localization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electromagnetic source localization problems stemming from linearized Poisson-type equation, the aim is to locate the sources within a domain that produce given measurements on the boundary. In this type of problem, biasing of the solution is one of the main causes of mislocalization. A technique called standardization was developed to reduce biasing. However, the lack of a mathematical foundation for this method can cause difficulties in its application and confusion regarding the reliability of solutions. Here, we give a rigorous and generalized treatment for the technique using the Bayesian framework to shed light on the technique's abilities and limitations. In addition, we take a look at the noise robustness of the method, which is widely reported in numerical studies. The paper starts by giving a gentle introduction to the problem and its bias and works its way toward standardization.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Programming Algorithms for Convex Hull Approximation with a Hyperplane Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following problem in computational geometry: given, in the d-dimensional real space, a set of points marked as positive and a set of points marked as negative, such that the convex hull of the positive set does not intersect the negative set, find K hyperplanes that separate, if possible, all the positive points from the negative ones. That is, we search for a convex polyhedron with at most K faces, containing all the positive points and no negative point. The problem is known in the literature for pure convex polyhedral approximation; our interest stems from its possible applications in constraint learning, where points are feasible or infeasible solutions of a Mixed Integer Program, and the K hyperplanes are linear constraints to be found. We cast the problem as an optimization one, minimizing the number of negative points inside the convex polyhedron, whenever exact separation cannot be achieved. We introduce models inspired by support vector machines and we design two mathematical programming formulations with binary variables. We exploit Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to obtain extended formulations, and we devise column generation algorithms with ad-hoc pricing routines. We compare computing time and separation error values obtained by all our approaches on synthetic datasets, with number of points from hundreds up to a few thousands, showing our approaches to perform better than existing ones from the literature. Furthermore, we observe that key computational differences arise, depending on whether the budget K is sufficient to completely separate the positive points from the negative ones or not. On 8-dimensional instances (and over), existing convex hull algorithms become computational inapplicable, while our algorithms allow to identify good convex hull approximations in minutes of computation.</description>

      <title>Computing an Aircraft's Gliding Range and Minimal Return Altitude in Presence of Obstacles and Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the event of a total loss of thrust, a pilot must identify a reachable landing site and subsequently execute a forced landing. To do so, they must estimate which region on the ground can be reached safely in gliding flight. We call this the gliding reachable region (GRR). To compute the GRR, we employ an optimal control formulation aiming to reach a point in space while minimizing altitude loss. A simplified model of the aircraft's dynamics is used, where the effect of turns is neglected. The resulting equations are discretized on a grid and solved numerically. Our algorithm for computing the GRR is fast enough to run in real time during flight, it accounts for ground obstacles and wind, and for each point in the GRR it outputs the path to reach it with minimal loss of altitude.
  A related problem is estimating the minimal altitude an aircraft needs in order to glide to a given airfield in the presence of obstacles. This information enables pilots to plan routes that always have an airport within gliding distance. We formalize this problem using an optimal control formulation based on the same aircraft dynamics model. The resulting equations are solved with a second algorithm that outputs the minimal re-entry altitude and the paths to reach the airfield from any position while avoiding obstacles.
  The algorithms we develop are based on the Ordered Upwind Method and the Fast Marching Method.</description>

      <title>Learning in Mean Field Games: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-cooperative and cooperative games with a very large number of players have many applications but remain generally intractable when the number of players increases. Introduced by Lasry and Lions, and Huang, Caines and Malham\'e, Mean Field Games (MFGs) rely on a mean-field approximation to allow the number of players to grow to infinity. Traditional methods for solving these games generally rely on solving partial or stochastic differential equations with a full knowledge of the model. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has appeared promising to solve complex problems at scale. The combination of RL and MFGs is promising to solve games at a very large scale both in terms of population size and environment complexity. In this survey, we review the quickly growing recent literature on RL methods to learn equilibria and social optima in MFGs. We first identify the most common settings (static, stationary, and evolutive) of MFGs. We then present a general framework for classical iterative methods (based on best-response computation or policy evaluation) to solve MFGs in an exact way. Building on these algorithms and the connection with Markov Decision Processes, we explain how RL can be used to learn MFG solutions in a model-free way. Last, we present numerical illustrations on a benchmark problem, and conclude with some perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve an expected utility-maximization problem with a Value-at-risk constraint on the terminal portfolio value in an incomplete financial market due to stochastic volatility. To derive the optimal investment strategy, we use the dynamic programming approach. We demonstrate that the value function in the constrained problem can be represented as the expected modified utility function of a vega-neutral financial derivative on the optimal terminal wealth in the unconstrained utility-maximization problem. Via the same financial derivative, the optimal wealth and the optimal investment strategy in the constrained problem are linked to the optimal wealth and the optimal investment strategy in the unconstrained problem. In numerical studies, we substantiate the impact of risk aversion levels and investment horizons on the optimal investment strategy. We observe a 20% relative difference between the constrained and unconstrained allocations for average parameters in a low-risk-aversion short-horizon setting.</description>

      <title>Recomputing Solutions to Perturbed Multi-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problems using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem aims to optimize the pickup and delivery of multiple unique commodities using a fleet of several agents with limited payload capacities. This paper addresses the challenge of quickly recomputing the solution to this NP-hard problem when there are unexpected perturbations to the nominal task definitions, likely to occur under real-world operating conditions. The proposed method first decomposes the nominal problem by constructing a search tree using Monte Carlo Tree Search for task assignment, and uses a rapid heuristic for routing each agent. When changes to the problem are revealed, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated with new costs under the updated problem parameters, generating solutions quicker and with a reduced optimality gap, as compared to recomputing the solution as an entirely new problem. Computational experiments are conducted by varying the locations of the nominal problem and the payload capacity of an agent to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing the nominal search tree to handle perturbations for real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>Robust Losses for Decision-Focused Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization models used to make discrete decisions often contain uncertain parameters that are context-dependent and estimated through prediction. To account for the quality of the decision made based on the prediction, decision-focused learning (end-to-end predict-then-optimize) aims at training the predictive model to minimize regret, i.e., the loss incurred by making a suboptimal decision. Despite the challenge of the gradient of this loss w.r.t. the predictive model parameters being zero almost everywhere for optimization problems with a linear objective, effective gradient-based learning approaches have been proposed to minimize the expected loss, using the empirical loss as a surrogate. However, empirical regret can be an ineffective surrogate because empirical optimal decisions can vary substantially from expected optimal decisions. To understand the impact of this deficiency, we evaluate the effect of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on the accuracy of empirical regret as a surrogate. Next, we propose three novel loss functions that approximate expected regret more robustly. Experimental results show that training two state-of-the-art decision-focused learning approaches using robust regret losses improves test-sample empirical regret in general while keeping computational time equivalent relative to the number of training epochs.</description>

      <title>The Power of Simple Menus in Robust Selling Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a robust selling problem where a seller attempts to sell one item to a buyer but is uncertain about the buyer's valuation distribution. Existing literature indicates that robust mechanism design provides a stronger theoretical guarantee than robust deterministic pricing. Meanwhile, the superior performance of robust mechanism design comes at the expense of implementation complexity given that the seller offers a menu with an infinite number of options, each coupled with a lottery and a payment for the buyer's selection. In view of this, the primary focus of our research is to find simple selling mechanisms that can effectively hedge against market ambiguity. We show that a selling mechanism with a small menu size (or limited randomization across a finite number of prices) is already capable of deriving significant benefits achieved by the optimal robust mechanism with infinite options. In particular, we develop a general framework to study the robust selling mechanism problem where the seller only offers a finite number of options in the menu. Then we propose a tractable reformulation that addresses a variety of ambiguity sets of the buyer's valuation distribution. Our formulation further enables us to characterize the optimal selling mechanisms and the corresponding competitive ratio for different menu sizes and various ambiguity sets, including support, mean, and quantile information. In light of the closed-form competitive ratios associated with different menu sizes, we provide managerial implications that incorporating a modest menu size already yields a competitive ratio comparable to the optimal robust mechanism with infinite options, which establishes a favorable trade-off between theoretical performance and implementation simplicity. Remarkably, a menu size of merely two can significantly enhance the competitive ratio, compared to the deterministic pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimality of a refraction strategy in the optimal dividends problem with absolutely continuous controls subject to Parisian ruin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider de Finetti's optimal dividends problem with absolutely continuous strategies in a spectrally negative L\'evy model with Parisian ruin as the termination time. The problem considered is essentially a generalization of both the control problems considered by Kyprianou, Loeffen &amp; P\'erez (2012) and by Renaud (2019). Using the language of scale functions for Parisian fluctuation theory, and under the assumption that the density of the L\'evy measure is completely monotone, we prove that a refraction dividend strategy is optimal and we characterize the optimal threshold. In particular, we study the effect of the rate of Parisian implementation delays on this optimal threshold.</description>

      <title>A consensus-based algorithm for non-convex multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel consensus-based zeroth-order algorithm tailored for non-convex multiplayer games. The proposed method leverages a metaheuristic approach using concepts from swarm intelligence to reliably identify global Nash equilibria. We utilize a group of interacting particles, each agreeing on a specific consensus point, asymptotically converging to the corresponding optimal strategy. This paradigm permits a passage to the mean-field limit, allowing us to establish convergence guarantees under appropriate assumptions regarding initialization and objective functions. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to unveil the dependency of the proposed method on its parameters and apply it to solve a nonlinear Cournot oligopoly game involving multiple goods.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for rare event tracking within the ensemble Kalman filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we employ importance sampling (IS) techniques to track a small over-threshold probability of a running maximum associated with the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the framework of ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). Between two observation times of the EnKF, we propose to use IS with respect to the initial condition of the SDE, IS with respect to the Wiener process via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and combined IS with respect to both initial condition and Wiener process. Both IS strategies require the approximation of the solution of Kolmogorov Backward equation (KBE) with boundary conditions. In multidimensional settings, we employ a Markovian projection dimension reduction technique to obtain an approximation of the solution of the KBE by just solving a one dimensional PDE. The proposed ideas are tested on three illustrative examples: Double Well SDE, Langevin dynamics and noisy Charney-deVore model, and showcase a significant variance reduction compared to the standard Monte Carlo method and another sampling-based IS technique, namely, multilevel cross entropy.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Contractivity in Control, Optimization, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction theory is a mathematical framework for studying the convergence, robustness, and modularity properties of dynamical systems and algorithms. In this opinion paper, we provide five main opinions on the virtues of contraction theory. These opinions are (i) contraction theory is a unifying framework emerging from classical and modern works, (ii) contractivity is computationally-friendly, robust, and modular stability, (iii) numerous dynamical systems are contracting, (iv) contraction theory is relevant to modern applications, and (v) contraction theory can be vastly extended in numerous directions. We survey recent theoretical and applied research in each of these five directions.</description>

      <title>Actively Learning Combinatorial Optimization Using a Membership Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with an unknown linear constraint using a membership oracle that, given a solution, determines whether it is feasible or infeasible with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we adapt a classical framework in order to solve the problem by learning and exploiting a surrogate linear constraint. The resulting new framework includes training a linear separator on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, one can consider using SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as Simple margin. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on the pure knapsack problem and on a college study plan problem from the literature to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of objective value.</description>
