      <title>Independent GUE minor processes of perfect matchings on rail-yard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perfect matchings on the rail-yard graphs in which the right boundary condition is given by the empty partition and the left boundary can be divided into finitely many alternating line segments where all the vertices along each line segment are either removed or remained. When the edge weights satisfy certain conditions, we show that the distributions of the locations of certain types of dimers near the right boundary converge to the spectra of independent GUE minor processes. The proof is based on new quantitative analysis of a formula to compute Schur functions at general points discovered in \cite{ZL18}.</description>

      <title>Uniform dispersion in growth models on homogeneous trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a population spatially structured in colonies that are vulnerable to catastrophic events occurring at random times, which randomly reduce their population size and compel survivors to disperse to neighboring areas. The dispersion behavior of survivors is critically significant for the survival of the entire species. In this paper, we consider an uniform dispersion scheme, where all possible survivor groupings are equally probable. The aim of the survivors is to establish new colonies, with individuals who settle in empty sites potentially initiating a new colony by themselves. However, all other individuals succumb to the catastrophe. We consider the number of dispersal options for surviving individuals in the aftermath of a catastrophe to be a fixed value $d$ within the neighborhood. In this context, we conceptualize the evolution of population dynamics occurring over a homogeneous tree. We investigate the conditions necessary for these populations to survive, presenting pertinent bounds for survival probability, the number of colonized vertices, the extent of dispersion within the population, and the mean time to extinction for the entire population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the uniform H\"{o}rmander's hypothesis we study smoothness and exponential bounds of the density of the law of the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with locally Lipschitz drift that satisfy a monotonicity condition. To avoid non-integrability problems we use results about Malliavin differentiability based on the concepts of Ray Absolute Continuity and Stochastic Gate\^aux differentiability.</description>

      <title>The Lions Derivative in Infinite Dimensions and Higher Order Expansion of Mean-Field SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new interpretation of the Lions derivative as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a vector measure, which provides a canonical extension of the Lions derivative for functions taking values in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. This is of particular relevance for the analysis of Hilbert space valued Mean-Field equations. As an illustration we derive a mild Ito-formula for Mean-Field SPDEs, which provides the basis for a higher order Taylor expansion and higher order numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Concentration and limit of large random matrices with given margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large random matrices with i.i.d. entries conditioned to have prescribed row and column sums (margin). This problem has rich connections to relative entropy minimization, Schr\"{o}dinger bridge, the enumeration of contingency tables, and random graphs with given degree sequences. We show that such margin-constrained random matrix is sharply concentrated around a certain deterministic matrix, which we call the \textit{typical table}. Typical tables have dual characterizations: (1) the expectation of the random matrix ensemble with minimum relative entropy from the base model constrained to have the expected target margin, and (2) the expectation of the maximum likelihood model obtained by rank-one exponential tilting of the base model. The structure of the typical table is dictated by two dual variables, which give the maximum likelihood estimates of the tilting parameters. Based on these results, for a sequence of "tame" margins that converges in \( L^{1} \) to a limiting continuum margin as the size of the matrix diverges, we show that the sequence of margin-constrained random matrices converges in cut norm to a limiting kernel, which is the $L^{2}$-limit of the corresponding rescaled typical tables. The rate of convergence is controlled by how fast the margins converge in $L^{1}$. We derive several new results for random contingency tables from our general framework.</description>

      <title>Speed of random walk on dynamical percolation in nonamenable transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nonamenable transitive unimodular graph. In dynamical percolation, every edge in $G$ refreshes its status at rate $\mu&gt;0$, and following the refresh, each edge is open independently with probability $p$. The random walk traverses $G$ only along open edges, moving at rate $1$. In the critical regime $p=p_c$, we prove that the speed of the random walk is at most $O(\sqrt{\mu \log(1/\mu)})$, provided that $\mu \le e^{-1}$. In the supercritical regime $p&gt;p_c$, we prove that the speed on $G$ is of order 1 (uniformly in $\mu)$, while in the subcritical regime $p&lt;p_c$, the speed is of order $\mu\wedge 1$.</description>

      <title>Random walk on dynamical percolation in Euclidean lattices: separating critical and supercritical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the random walk on dynamical percolation of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., the two-dimensional triangular lattice $\mathcal{T}$), where each edge (resp., each site) can either be open or closed, refreshing its status at rate $\mu\in (0,1/e]$. The random walk moves along open edges in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., open sites in $\mathcal{T}$) at rate $1$. For the critical regime $p=p_c$, we prove the following two results: on $\mathcal{T}$, the mean squared displacement of the random walk from $0$ to $t$ is at most $O(t\mu^{5/132-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$; on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq 11$, the corresponding upper bound for the mean squared displacement is $O(t \mu^{1/2}\log(1/\mu))$. For the supercritical regime $p&gt;p_c$, we prove that the mean squared displacement on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is at least $ct$ for some $c=c(d)&gt;0$ that does not depend on $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Invariance Times Transfer Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariance times are stopping times $\tau$ such that local martingales with respect to some reduced filtration and an equivalently changed probability measure, stopped before $\tau$ , are local martingales with respect to the original model filtration and probability measure. They arise naturally for modeling the default time of a dealer bank, in the mathematical finance context of counterparty credit risk. Assuming an invariance time endowed with an intensity and a positive Az{\'e}ma supermartingale, this work establishes a dictionary relating the semimartingale calculi in the original and reduced stochastic bases, regarding in particular conditional expectations, martingales, stochastic integrals, random measure stochastic integrals, martingale representation properties, semimartingale characteristics, Markov properties, transition semigroups and infinitesimal generators, and solutions of backward stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>On the Particle Approximation of Lagged Feynman-Kac Formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the numerical approximation of the limiting invariant measure associated with Feynman-Kac formulae. These are expressed in a discrete time formulation and are associated with a Markov chain and a potential function. The typical application considered here is the computation of eigenvalues associated with non-negative operators as found, for example, in physics or particle simulation of rare-events. We focus on a novel \emph{lagged} approximation of this invariant measure, based upon the introduction of a ratio of time-averaged Feynman-Kac marginals associated with a positive operator iterated $l \in\mathbb{N}$ times; a lagged Feynman-Kac formula. This estimator and its approximation using Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) have been extensively employed in the physics literature. In short, DMC is an iterative algorithm involving $N\in\mathbb{N}$ particles or walkers simulated in parallel, that undergo sampling and resampling operations. In this work, it is shown that for the DMC approximation of the lagged Feynman-Kac formula, one has an almost sure characterization of the $\mathbb{L}_1$-error as the time parameter (iteration) goes to infinity and this is at most of $\mathcal{O}(\exp\{-\kappa l\}/N)$, for $\kappa&gt;0$. In addition a non-asymptotic in time, and time uniform $\mathbb{L}_1-$bound is proved which is $\mathcal{O}(l/\sqrt{N})$. We also prove a novel central limit theorem to give a characterization of the exact asymptotic in time variance. This analysis demonstrates that the strategy used in physics, namely, to run DMC with $N$ and $l$ small and, for long time enough, is mathematically justified. Our results also suggest how one should choose $N$ and $l$ in practice. We emphasize that these results are not restricted to physical applications; they have broad relevance to the general problem of particle simulation of the Feynman-Kac formula.</description>

      <title>Self-repellent branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time binary branching random walk with independent standard normal increments subject to a penalty $\b$ for every pair of particles that get within distance $\e$ of each other at any time. We give a precise description of the most likely configurations of the particles under this law for $N$ large and $\b,\e$ fixed. Particles spread out over a distance $2^{2N/3}$, essentially in finite time, and subsequently arrange themselves so that at time $2N/3$ they cover a grid of width $\e$ with one particle per site. After time $2N/3$, the bulk of the particles and their descendants do not move anymore, while the particles in a boundary layer of width $2^{N/3}$ form a ``staircase" to the particles in the bulk. At time $N$, each site in the boundary layer is occupied by $2^{N/3}$ particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a precise deviation formula for the intersection of two Orlicz balls generated by Orlicz functions $V$ and $W$. Additionally, we establish a (quantitative) central limit theorem in the critical case and a strong law of large numbers for the "$W$-norm" of the uniform distribution on $\mathbb{B}^{(n,V)}$. Our techniques also enable us to derive a precise formula for the thin-shell concentration of uniformly distributed random vectors in high-dimensional Orlicz balls. In our approach we establish an Edgeworth-expansion using methods from harmonic analysis together with an exponential change of measure argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns generalized backward stochastic differential equations, which are coupled with a family of reflecting diffusion processes. First of all, we establish the large deviation principle for forward stochastic differential equations with reflecting boundaries under weak monotonicity conditions. Then based on the obtained result and the contraction principle, the large deviation principle for the generalized backward stochastic differential equations is proved. As a by-product, we obtain a limit result about parabolic partial differential equations with the nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Mokobodzki's intervals: an approach to Dynkin games when value process is not a semimartingale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dynkin games governed by a nonlinear $\mathbb E^f$-expectation on a finite interval $[0,T]$, with payoff c\`adl\`ag processes $L,U$ of class (D) which are not imposed to satisfy (weak) Mokobodzki's condition - the existence of a c\`adl\`ag semimartingale between the barriers. For that purpose we introduce the notion of Mokobodzki's stochastic intervals $\mathscr M(\theta)$ (roughly speaking, maximal stochastic interval on which Mokobodzki's condition is satisfied when starting from the stopping time $\theta$) and the notion of reflected BSDEs without Mokobodzki's condition (this is a generalization and modification of the notion introduced by Hamad\'ene and Hassani (2005)). We prove an existence and uniqueness result for RBSDEs with driver $f$ that is non-increasing with respect to the value variable (no restrictions on the growth) and Lipschitz continuous with respect to the control variable, and with data in $L^1$ spaces. Next, by using RBSDEs, we show numerous results on Dynkin games: existence of the value process, saddle points, and convergence of the penalty scheme. We also show that the game is not played beyond $\mathscr M(\theta)$, when starting from $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Poisson Random Fields on $\mathbb{R}^2_+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a fractional Poisson random field (FPRF) on positive plane. It is defined as a process whose one dimensional distribution is the solution of a system of fractional partial differential equations. A time-changed representation for the FPRF is given in terms of the composition of Poisson random field with a bivariate random process. Some integrals of the FPRF are introduced and studied. Using the Adomian decomposition method, a closed form expression for its probability mass function is obtained in terms of the generalized Wright function. Some results related to the order statistics of random numbers of random variables are presented. Also, we introduce a generalization of Poisson random field on $\mathbb{R}^d_+$, $d\ge1$ which reduces to the Poisson random field in a special case. For $d=1$, it further reduces to a generalized Poisson process (GPP). A time-changed representation for the GPP is established. Moreover, we construct a time-changed linear and planer random motions of a particle driven by the GPP. The conditional distribution of the random position of particle is derived. Later, we define the compound fractional Poisson random field via FPRF. Also, a generalized version of it on $\mathbb{R}^d_+$, $d\ge1$ is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for random nonlinear wave equations: weak dissipation and localized control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new criterion for exponential mixing of random dynamical systems. Our criterion is applicable to a wide range of systems, including in particular dispersive equations. Its verification is in nature related to several topics, i.e., asymptotic compactness in dynamical systems, global stability of evolution equations, and localized control problems.
  As an initial application, we exploit the exponential mixing of random nonlinear wave equations with degenerate damping, critical nonlinearity, and physically localized noise. The essential challenge lies in the fact that the weak dissipation and randomness interact in the evolution.</description>

      <title>Practical multi-fidelity machine learning: fusion of deterministic and Bayesian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity machine learning methods address the accuracy-efficiency trade-off by integrating scarce, resource-intensive high-fidelity data with abundant but less accurate low-fidelity data. We propose a practical multi-fidelity strategy for problems spanning low- and high-dimensional domains, integrating a non-probabilistic regression model for the low-fidelity with a Bayesian model for the high-fidelity. The models are trained in a staggered scheme, where the low-fidelity model is transfer-learned to the high-fidelity data and a Bayesian model is trained for the residual. This three-model strategy -- deterministic low-fidelity, transfer learning, and Bayesian residual -- leads to a prediction that includes uncertainty quantification both for noisy and noiseless multi-fidelity data. The strategy is general and unifies the topic, highlighting the expressivity trade-off between the transfer-learning and Bayesian models (a complex transfer-learning model leads to a simpler Bayesian model, and vice versa). We propose modeling choices for two scenarios, and argue in favor of using a linear transfer-learning model that fuses 1) kernel ridge regression for low-fidelity with Gaussian processes for high-fidelity; or 2) deep neural network for low-fidelity with a Bayesian neural network for high-fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed strategies and contrast them with the state-of-the-art based on various numerical examples. The simplicity of these formulations makes them practical for a broad scope of future engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Pandora's Box Problem Over Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In its simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a distribution over the reward hidden within. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive ordering, and obtains as utility the difference between the largest reward uncovered and the sum of the inspection costs. While this classic version of the problem is well understood (Weitzman 1979), recent years have seen a flourishing of the literature on variants of the problem. In this paper, we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., as it might constrain the schedules of exploration and influence both costs and rewards. In the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, each box is characterized by time-dependent rewards and costs, and inspecting it might require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time, possibly differently for each box. Our main result is an efficient $21.3$-approximation to the optimal strategy, which is NP-hard to compute in general. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, or when costs and reward distributions do not depend on time (but rewards may deteriorate after inspecting).</description>

      <title>Lower bound for simulation cost of open quantum systems: Lipschitz continuity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been extensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has focused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to calculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov semigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of convexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze the necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that achieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and non-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is illustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several examples.</description>

      <title>Score matching for bridges without time-reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15455v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning a bridged diffusion process using score-matching methods. Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, gives us a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, ours learns the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$, for given $t, Y$ directly, completely avoiding the need for first learning a time reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term. The code can be found at https://github.com/libbylbaker/forward_bridge.</description>

      <title>Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</description>

      <title>Exact bounds for some quadratic empirical processes with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Z_1,\ldots,Z_n$ be i.i.d. isotropic random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^p$, and $T \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ be a compact set. A classical line of empirical process theory characterizes the size of the suprema of the quadratic process \begin{align*} \sup_{t \in T} \bigg| \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \langle Z_i,t \rangle^2-\lVert t \rVert^2 \bigg|, \end{align*} via a single parameter known as the Gaussian width of $T$.
  This paper introduces an improved bound for the suprema of this quadratic process for standard Gaussian vectors $\{Z_i\}$ that can be exactly attained for certain choices of $T$, and is thus referred to as an exact bound. Our exact bound is expressed via a collection of (stochastic) Gaussian widths over spherical sections of $T$ that serves as a natural multi-scale analogue to the Gaussian width of $T$. Compared to the classical bounds for the quadratic process, our new bounds not only determine the optimal constants in the classical bounds that can be attained for some $T$, but also precisely capture certain subtle phase transitional behavior of the quadratic process beyond the reach of the classical bounds.
  To illustrate the utility of our results, we obtain tight versions of the Gaussian Dvoretzky-Milman theorem for random projection, and the Koltchinskii-Lounici theorem for covariance estimation, both with optimal constants. Moreover, our bounds recover the celebrated BBP phase transitional behavior of the top eigenvalue of the sample covariance and its generalization to the sample covariance error.
  The proof of our results exploits recently sharpened Gaussian comparison inequalities. The technical scope of our method of proof is further demonstrated in obtaining an exact bound for a two-sided Chevet inequality.</description>

Abstract: Let $Z=(Z^{1}, \ldots, Z^{d})$ be the d-dimensional L\'evy {process} where {$Z^i$'s} are independent 1-dimensional L\'evy {processes} with identical jumping kernel $ \nu^1(r) =r^{-1}\phi(r)^{-1}$. Here $\phi$ is {an} increasing function with weakly scaling condition of order $\underline \alpha, \overline \alpha\in (0, 2)$. We consider a symmetric function $J(x,y)$ comparable to \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases} \nu^1(|x^i - y^i|)\qquad&amp;\text{ if $x^i \ne y^i$ for some $i$ and $x^j = y^j$ for all $j \ne i$}\\ 0\qquad&amp;\text{ if $x^i \ne y^i$ for more than one index $i$}. \end{cases} \end{align*} Corresponding to the jumping kernel $J$, there exists an anisotropic Markov process $X$, see \cite{KW22}. In this article, we establish sharp two-sided Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for $X$ in $C^{1,1}$ open set, under certain regularity conditions. As an application of the main results, we derive the Green function estimates.</description>

      <title>Dispersion on the Complete Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially,~$M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of each time step, for every vertex inhabited by at least two particles, each of these particles moves independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle.
  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph on~$n$ vertices, then there is a phase transition when the number of particles $M = n/2$. They showed that if $M&lt;(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then the process finishes in a logarithmic number of steps, while if $M&gt;(1+\varepsilon)n/2$, an exponential number of steps are required with high probability. Here we provide a thorough asymptotic analysis of the dispersion time around criticality, where $\varepsilon = o(1)$, and describe the transition from logarithmic to exponential time. As a consequence of our results we establish, for example, that the dispersion time is in probability and in expectation in $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ when $|\varepsilon| = O(n^{-1/2})$, and provide qualitative bounds for its tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions relating to the lengths of longest monotone subsequences of involutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03798v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the length of longest monotone subsequences in random (fixed-point free) involutions of $n$ integers as $n$ grows large, establishing asymptotic expansions in powers of $n^{-1/6}$ in the general case and in powers of $n^{-1/3}$ in the fixed-point free cases. Whilst the limit laws were shown by Baik and Rains to be one of the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ for $\beta=1$ or $\beta=4$, we find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher order derivatives of $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. Our derivation is based on a concept of generalized analytic de-Poissonization and is subject to the validity of certain hypotheses for which we provide compelling (computational) evidence. In a preparatory step expansions of the hard-to-soft edge transition laws of L$\beta$E are studied, which are lifted into expansions of the generalized Poissonized length distributions for large intensities. (This paper continues our work arXiv:2301.02022, which established similar results in the case of general permutations and $\beta=2$.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fractal Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket or carpet graph in dimension $d\geq 2,$ denoted by $G$. At time $0$, we place a Poisson point process of particles onto the graph and let them perform independent simple random walks, which in this setting exhibit sub-diffusive behaviour. We generalise the concept of particle process dependent Lipschitz percolation to the (coarse graining of the) space-time graph $G\times \mathbb{R}$, where the opened/closed state of space-time cells is measurable with respect to the particle process inside the cell. We then provide an application of this generalised framework and prove the following: if particles can spread an infection when they share a site of $G$, and if they recover independently at some rate $\gamma&gt;0$, then if $\gamma$ is sufficiently small, the infection started with a single infected particle survives indefinitely with positive probability.</description>

In this case the domain could be localized near the target and explicit computations are possible. The asymptotic behavior is only related to $\epsilon$ up to some multiplicative constants that depends on the domain and boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider one-dimensional stochastic Volterra equations with jumps for which we establish conditions upon the convolution kernel and coefficients for the strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of a non-negative c\`adl\`ag solution. By using the approach recently developed in arXiv:2302.07758, we show the strong existence by using a nonnegative approximation of the equation whose convergence is proved via a variant of the Yamada--Watanabe approximation technique. We apply our results to L\'evy-driven stochastic Volterra equations. In particular, we are able to define a Volterra extension of the so-called alpha-stable Cox--Ingersoll--Ross process, which is especially used for applications in Mathematical Finance.</description>

Abstract: We study the average $p-$Wasserstein distance between a finite sample of an infinite hyperuniform point process on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and its mean for any $p\geq 1$. The average Wasserstein transport cost is shown to be bounded from above and from below by some multiples of the number of points. More generally, we give a control on the $p-$Wasserstein distance in function of a control on the $L^p$ norm of the difference of the point process and its mean. We also obtain the $d$-dimensional version of this result.</description>

      <title>Optimal single threshold stopping rules and sharp prophet inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite horizon optimal stopping problem for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The objective is to design stopping rules that attempt to select the random variable with the highest value in the sequence. The performance of any stopping rule may be benchmarked relative to the selection of a "prophet" that has perfect foreknowledge of the largest value. Such comparisons are typically stated in the form of "prophet inequalities." In this paper we characterize sharp prophet inequalities for single threshold stopping rules as solutions to infinite two person zero sum games on the unit square with special payoff kernels. The proposed game theoretic characterization allows one to derive sharp non-asymptotic prophet inequalities for different classes of distributions. This, in turn, gives rise to a simple and computationally tractable algorithmic paradigm for deriving optimal single threshold stopping rules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure to construct a natural representation of the Virasoro algebra of central charge $c = c(\kappa) \le 1$. In particular, we introduce a non-degenerate bilinear Hermitian form (not positive-definite) using the SLE loop measure and show that the representation is (indefinite) unitary. Our proof relies on the infinitesimal conformal restriction property of the SLE loop measure.</description>

      <title>Power rate of convergence of discrete curves: framework and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general framework of estimates for convergence rates of random discrete model curves approaching Schramm Loewner Evolution (SLE) curves in the lattice size scaling limit. We show that a power-law convergence rate of an interface to an SLE curve can be derived from a power-law convergence rate for an appropriate martingale observable provided the discrete curve satisfies a specific bound on crossing events, the Kempannien-Smirnov condition, along with an estimate on the growth of the derivative of the SLE curve. We apply our framework to show that the exploration process for critical site percolation on hexagonal lattice converges to the SLE$_6$ curve with a power-law convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Schur Multipliers of $C^*$-algebras, group-invariant compactification and applications to amenability and percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group. Given any sequence $(f_n)_{n\geq 1}$ of $\ell^p$-normalized functions ($p\in [1,2)$), consider the associated positive definite matrix coefficients $\langle f_n, \rho(\cdot) f_n\rangle$ of the right regular representation $\rho$. We construct an orthogonal decomposition of the corresponding {\it Schur multipliers} on the reduced group $C^*$-algebra or the uniform Roe algebra of $\Gamma$. We identify this decomposition explicitly via the limit points of the orbits $(\widetilde f_n)_{n\geq 1}$ in the group-invariant compactification of the quotient space constructed by Varadhan and the first author in [14]. We apply this result and use positive-definiteness to provide two (quite different) characterizations of amenability of $\Gamma$ -- one via a variational approach and the other using group-invariant percolation on Cayley graphs constructed by Benjamini, Lyons, Peres and Schramm [1]. These results underline, from a new point of view to the best of our knowledge, the manner in which Schur multipliers capture geometric properties of the underlying group $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Off-the-grid prediction and testing for linear combination of translated features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model where a signal (discrete or continuous) is observed with an additive Gaussian noise process. The signal is issued from a linear combination of a finite but increasing number of translated features. The features are continuously parameterized by their location and depend on some scale parameter. First, we extend previous prediction results for off-the-grid estimators by taking into account here that the scale parameter may vary. The prediction bounds are analogous, but we improve the minimal distance between two consecutive features locations in order to achieve these bounds. Next, we propose a goodness-of-fit test for the model and give non-asymptotic upper bounds of the testing risk and of the minimax separation rate between two distinguishable signals. In particular, our test encompasses the signal detection framework. We deduce upper bounds on the minimal energy,expressed as the $\ell_2$-norm of the linear coefficients, to successfully detect a signal in presence of noise. The general model considered in this paper is a non-linear extension of the classical high-dimensional regression model. It turns out that,in this framework, our upper bound on the minimax separation rate matches (up to a logarithmic factor) the lower bound on the minimax separation rate for signal detection in the high-dimensional linear model associated to a fixed dictionary of features. We also propose a procedure to test whether the features of the observed signal belong to a given finite collection under the assumption that the linear coefficients may vary, but have prescribed signs under the null hypothesis. A non-asymptotic upper bound on the testing risk is given.We illustrate our results on the spikes deconvolution model with Gaussian features on the real line and with the Dirichlet kernel, frequently used in the compressed sensing literature, on the torus.</description>

      <title>Haagerup property and group-invariant percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G$ be the Cayley graph of a finitely generated, infinite group $\Gamma$. We show that $\Gamma$ has the Haagerup property if and only if for every $\alpha&lt;1$, there is a $\Gamma$-invariant bond percolation $\mathbb P$ on $\mathcal G$ with $\mathbb E[\mathrm{deg}_{\omega}(g)]&gt;\alpha\mathrm{deg}_{\mathcal G}(g)$ for every vertex $g$ and with the two-point function $\tau(g,h)=\mathbb P\big[g\leftrightarrow h\big]$ vanishing as $d(g,h)\to\infty$. On the other hand, we show that $\Gamma$ has Kazhdan's property (T) if and only if there exists a threshold $\alpha^*&lt;1$ such that for every $\Gamma$-invariant bond percolation $\mathbb P$ on $\mathcal G$, $\mathbb E[\mathrm{deg}_\omega(o)]&gt;\alpha^*\mathrm{deg}(o)$ implies that the two-point function is uniformly bounded away from zero. These results in particular answer questions raised by Lyons (J. Math. Phys. 41. 1099-1126 (2000)) about characterizations of properties of groups beyond amenability through group-invariant percolations.
  The method of proof is new and is based on a construction of percolations with suitable dependence structures built from invariant point processes on spaces with measured walls. This construction furthermore leads to quantitative bounds on the two-point functions, exhibiting in particular exponential decay of the two-point function in several prominent examples of Haagerup groups, including co-compact Fuchsian groups, co-compact discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb H^n)$ and lamplighters over free groups. This method also allows us to extend the aforementioned characterization of property (T) to the setting of relative property (T) and provide an application to Bernoulli percolation at the uniqueness threshold.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Matrix Discrepancy: Asymptotics and Online Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator norm discrepancy of i.i.d. random matrices, initiating the matrix-valued analog of a long line of work on the $\ell^{\infty}$ norm discrepancy of i.i.d. random vectors. First, using repurposed results on vector discrepancy and new first moment method calculations, we give upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy of random matrices. We treat i.i.d. matrices drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and low-rank Gaussian Wishart distributions. In both cases, for what turns out to be the "critical" number of $\Theta(n^2)$ matrices of dimension $n \times n$, we identify the discrepancy up to constant factors. Second, we give a new analysis of the matrix hyperbolic cosine algorithm of Zouzias (2011), a matrix version of an online vector discrepancy algorithm of Spencer (1977) studied for average-case inputs by Bansal and Spencer (2020), for the case of i.i.d. random matrix inputs. We both give a general analysis and extract concrete bounds on the discrepancy achieved by this algorithm for matrices with independent entries (including GOE matrices) and Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

      <title>Random Carleson Sequences for the Hardy space on the Polydisc and the Unit Ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Kolmogorov 0-1 law for a random sequence with prescribed radii so that it generates a Carleson measure almost surely, both for the Hardy space on the polydisc and the Hardy space on the unit ball, thus providing improved versions of previous results of the first two authors and of a separate result of Massaneda. In the polydisc, the geometry of such sequences is not well understood, so we proceed by studying the random Gramians generated by random sequences, using tools from the theory of random matrices. Another result we prove, and that is of its own relevance, is the 0-1 law for a random sequence to be partitioned into M separated sequences with respect to the pseudo-hyperbolic distance, which is used also to describe the random sequences that are interpolating for the Bloch space on the unit disc almost surely.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Gaussian Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article delves into the $L_p$ Minkowski problem within the framework of generalized Gaussian probability space. This type of probability space was initially introduced in information theory through the seminal works of Lutwak, Yang, and Zhang [49,50], as well as by Lutwak, Lv, Yang, and Zhang [45]. The primary focus of this article lies in examining the existence of this problem. While the variational method is employed to explore the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the normalized Minkowski problem when $p \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, our main emphasis is on the existence of the generalized Gaussian Minkowski problem without the normalization requirement, particularly in the smooth category for $p \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Simpson's paradox via the common cause principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simpson's paradox is an obstacle to establishing a probabilistic association between two events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given the third (lurking) random variable $B$. We focus on scenarios when the random variables $A$ (which combines $a_1$, $a_2$, and their complements) and $B$ have a common cause $C$ that need not be observed. Alternatively, we can assume that $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$. For such cases, the correct association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ is to be defined via conditioning over $C$. This setup generalizes the original Simpson's paradox: now its two contradicting options refer to two particular and different causes $C$. We show that if $B$ and $C$ are binary and $A$ is quaternary (the minimal and the most widespread situation for the Simpson's paradox), the conditioning over any binary common cause $C$ establishes the same direction of association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ as the conditioning over $B$ in the original formulation of the paradox. Thus, for the minimal common cause, one should choose the option of Simpson's paradox that assumes conditioning over $B$ and not its marginalization. The same conclusion is reached when Simpson's paradox is formulated via 3 continuous Gaussian variables: within the minimal formulation of the paradox (3 scalar continuous variables $A_1$, $A_2$, and $B$), one should choose the option with the conditioning over $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents algorithms for generating small random samples without replacement. It considers two cases. It presents an algorithm for sampling a pair of distinct integers, and an algorithm for sampling a triple of distinct integers. The worst case runtime of both algorithms is constant, while the worst case runtime of common algorithms for the general case of sampling $k$ elements from a set of $n$ are linear in $n$. Java implementations of both algorithms are included in the open source library $\rho\mu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a specific type of SCM, called a Dynamic Structural Causal Model (DSCM), whose endogenous variables represent functions of time, which is possibly cyclic and allows for latent confounding. As a motivating use-case, we show that certain systems of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) can be appropriately represented with DSCMs. An immediate consequence of this construction is a graphical Markov property for systems of SDEs. We define a time-splitting operation, allowing us to analyse the concept of local independence (a notion of continuous-time Granger (non-)causality). We also define a subsampling operation, which returns a discrete-time DSCM, and which can be used for mathematical analysis of subsampled time-series. We give suggestions how DSCMs can be used for identification of the causal effect of time-dependent interventions, and how existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms can be applied to time-series data.</description>

      <title>Errors-In-Variables Model Fitting for Partially Unpaired Data Utilizing Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce a general argumentation framework for regression in the errors-in-variables regime, allowing for full flexibility about the dimensionality of the data, error probability density types, the (linear or nonlinear) model type and the avoidance of ad-hoc definitions of loss functions. In this framework we introduce model fitting for partially unpaired data, i.e. for given data groups the pairing information of input and output is lost (semi-supervised). This is achieved by constructing mixture model densities, which directly model this loss of pairing information allowing for inference. In a numerical simulation study linear and nonlinear model fits are illustrated as well as a real data study is presented based on life expectancy data from the world bank utilizing a multiple linear regression model. These results allow the conclusion that high quality model fitting is possible with partially unpaired data, which opens the possibility for new applications with unfortunate or deliberate loss of pairing information in the data.</description>
