      <title>Investigation of reaction and $\alpha$ production cross sections with $^9$Be projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to investigate the contribution of $\alpha$ production in the reaction cross sections, measurements of elastic scattering and inclusive $\alpha$ particle angular distributions have been carried out with the $^9$Be projectile on $^{89}$Y, $^{124}$Sn, $^{159}$Tb, $^{198}$Pt, and $^{209}$Bi targets over a wide angular range at energies near the Coulomb barrier. The measured elastic scattering angular distributions were fitted with optical model calculations, and reaction cross sections were extracted. The same data were also analysed using both global optical model potentials (Global OMP) and microscopic S$\tilde{a}$o Paulo potentials (SPP), to obtain the reaction cross sections. The data available in the literature for $^9$Be projectile includes the elastic scattering angular distributions, $\alpha$ production cross sections, and complete fusion cross sections on these and other targets at several energies are also utilised for comparative studies. The reaction cross section extracted from the three potentials (Best Fit, Global OMP and SPP) are in reasonable agreement for all the targets except for the energies below the barrier where the results from SPP deviate by 30-50 \%. Inclusive $\alpha$ particle production cross sections were also extracted by integrating the $\alpha$ particle angular distributions. The present data and data available from literature of reaction and $\alpha$-particle production cross sections were utilised to make systematic studies. Systematics of reaction and $\alpha$-particle production cross sections revealed their universal behaviour.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mesonic decay branch of the $\bar{K}\!N\!N$ quasi-bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted measurements of $K^- + {^3{\rm He}} \to \pi \!Y \!N + N'$ reactions using $1~{\rm GeV}/c$ $K^-$-beam, aiming to understand the broad decay width of $\bar{K} \!N \!N$ ($\approx$ twice as broad as that of $\Lambda(1405)$ considered to be the $\bar{K} \!N$ quasi-bound state). We successfully reproduced distributions of the $\pi \! Y \! N$ invariant mass and momentum transfer of $\pi \! Y \! N$ by employing model fitting functions for $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ formation and quasi-free $\bar{K}$ absorption (${\rm QF}_{\bar{K}-{\rm abs}}$) processes. The model can describe the experimental data quite well, and four $\bar{K} \! N \! N \to \pi \! Y \! N $ cross-sections were obtained. The result suggests that the mesonic decay is the dominant decay branch of $\bar{K} \! N \! N$. It was also suggested that $\Gamma_{\pi \Lambda N} \sim \Gamma_{\pi \Sigma N}$, which indicates a significant contribution of the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=1$ absorption channel to the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ decay as well as the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=0$ makes the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ state $\approx$ twice as unstable as $\Lambda$(1405).</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of the atomic mass of $^{84}$Sr and implications to isotope shift studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute mass of $^{84}$Sr was determined using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. A more precise value for the mass of $^{84}$Sr is essential for providing potential indications of physics beyond the Standard Model through high-precision isotope shift measurements of Sr atomic transition frequencies. The mass excess of $^{84}$Sr was refined to be -80649.229(37) keV/c$^2$ from high-precision cyclotron-frequency-ratio measurements with a relative precision of 4.8$\times$10$^{-10}$. The obtained mass-excess value is in agreement with the adopted value in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020, but is 30 times more precise. With this new value, we confirm the previously observed nonlinearity in the study of the isotope shift of strontium. Moreover, the double-beta ($2\beta^{+}$) decay $Q$ value of $^{84}$Sr was directly determined to be 1790.115(37) keV, and the precision was improved by a factor of 30.</description>

      <title>Impact of The Newly Revised Gravitational Redshift of X-ray Burster GS 1826-24 on The Equation of State of Supradense Neutron-Rich Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Mechanism of Chiral Three-Nucleon Force in Driving Spin-Orbit Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-nucleon force (3NF) is crucial in shaping the shell structure of atomic nuclei, particularly impacting the enhancement of spin-orbit (SO) splitting, especially in nuclei with significant deviations from stability. Despite its importance, the specific mechanisms driving this enhancement remain unclear. In this study, we introduce a decomposition scheme based on the rank of irreducible tensors forming the 3NF, derived from chiral effective field theory at next-to-next-to-leading order, to elucidate their influence on SO splitting. Within the shell-model framework, our analysis reveals that the rank-1 component of the 3NF is the primary factor enlarging the energy gap between the $0p_{3/2}$ and $0p_{1/2}$ single-particle levels in $p$-shell nuclei, while the rank-2 component makes a subdominant contribution. We also remark on the antisymmetry of the rank-1 3NF, as a means to clarify the disentanglement of quantum spin states. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration into this field toward a microscopic understanding of the 3NF impact on the nuclear shell structure.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Antimatter Hypernucleus $^4_{\bar{\Lambda}}\overline{\hbox{H}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimatter is a research topic of fundamental interest. Sufficient matter-antimatter asymmetry in the early Universe created the matter-dominated world today. The origin of this asymmetry is not completely understood to date. High-energy nuclear collisions create conditions similar to the Universe microseconds after the Big Bang, with comparable amounts of matter and antimatter. Much of the antimatter created escapes the rapidly expanding fireball without annihilation, making such collisions an effective experimental tool to create heavy antimatter nuclear objects and study their properties. In this paper, we report the first observation of the antimatter hypernucleus $^4_{\bar{\Lambda}}\overline{\hbox{H}}$, composed of an $\bar{\Lambda}$, an antiproton and two antineutrons. The discovery was made through its two-body decay after production in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In total, 15.6 candidate $^4_{\bar{\Lambda}}\overline{\hbox{H}}$ antimatter hypernuclei are obtained with an estimated background count of 6.4. Lifetimes of the antihypernuclei $^3_{\bar{\Lambda}}\overline{\hbox{H}}$ and $^4_{\bar{\Lambda}}\overline{\hbox{H}}$ are measured and compared with the lifetimes of their corresponding hypernuclei, testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter. Various production yield ratios among (anti)hypernuclei and (anti)nuclei are also measured and compared with theoretical model predictions, shedding light on their production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Nuclear density dependence of polarization transfer in quasi-elastic ${\rm A}(\vec{e},e' \vec{p})$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratio of the transverse and longitudinal component of polarization transfer to protons in quasi-elastic $(\vec{e}, e^{\prime} \vec{p}\,)$ reaction, $P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z$, is sensitive to the proton's electromagnetic form factor ratio, $G_E/G_M$. To explore density-dependent in-medium modifications, a comparison of polarization transfer ratios involving protons from distinct nuclear shells, each with different local nuclear densities, has been proposed. In this study, we present such comparisons between four shells, $1s_{1/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$ in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ and $1d_{3/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$ in $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$. In an effort to account for other many-body effects that may differ between shells, we use state-of-the-art relativistic distorted-wave impulse-approximation (RDWIA) calculation and present the double ratios, $(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm Data}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm RDWIA}$ as well as the super ratios, $\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm Data}/\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm RDWIA}$, for chosen shells A and B, as a function of effective local nuclear densities. We find that double ratios for individual shells show a dependence on the probed effective nuclear densities. Studying the ratios, we observed a systematic variation between pairs of higher- and lower-density shells.</description>

      <title>$g_{\rm A}$-sensitive $\beta$ spectral shapes in the mass $A=86-99$ region assessed by the nuclear shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an expanding interest in experimental studies of $\beta$ electrons (electrons emitted in $\beta^-$ decay transitions) and their energy distributions, the so-called $\beta$-electron spectra. These experiments are interested mainly in $\beta$ transitions with electron spectra sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling $g_{\rm A}$. In the present paper we make an extensive search for $g_{\rm A}$ sensitive $\beta$ spectral shapes in the $A=86-99$ region using the nuclear shell model with the well established Hamiltonians $\textit{glekpn}$ and $\textit{jj45pnb}$, designed to render a good description of the spectroscopic properties of nuclei in this mass region. We have found eight $\beta^-$ decay transitions with various degrees of $g_{\rm A}$ sensitivity. Moreover, these transitions are also important in pinning down the value of the so-called small relativistic vector nuclear matrix element, sNME. In addition, some of the corresponding mother nuclei are important contributors to the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. All this means that the found $\beta$ transitions are potentially of great interest for future rare-events experiments.</description>

      <title>SIDIS at small $x$ at next-to-leading order: gluon contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of gluons to single inclusive hadron production at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small $x$ using the Color Glass Condensate formalism. It is shown that the only divergence present is the standard collinear divergence which is absorbed into evolution of gluon-hadron fragmentation function. Our calculations are performed at finite $N_c$ and we provide general finite $N_c$ expressions for the structure of Wilson lines appearing in inclusive dihadron and single hadron production cross sections. We also comment on how one can obtain rapidity distribution of hadron multiplicities from our results.</description>

      <title>Global Fit of Electron and Neutrino Elastic Scattering Data to Determine the Strange Quark Contribution to the Vector and Axial Form Factors of the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE) neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the proton. Previous fits of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734. These fits did not constrain the strangeness contribution to the axial form factor $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there was no NCE data for $Q^2&lt;0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been employed: a relativistic Fermi gas model, the SuperScaling Approximation model, and a spectral function model. We find a tremendous improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE.</description>
