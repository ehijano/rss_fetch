      <title>Learning Closed-Loop Parametric Nash Equilibria of Multi-Agent Collaborative Field Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a challenging and active field of research due to the inherent nonstationary property and coupling between agents. A popular approach to modeling the multi-agent interactions underlying the multi-agent RL problem is the Markov Game. There is a special type of Markov Game, termed Markov Potential Game, which allows us to reduce the Markov Game to a single-objective optimal control problem where the objective function is a potential function. In this work, we prove that a multi-agent collaborative field coverage problem, which is found in many engineering applications, can be formulated as a Markov Potential Game, and we can learn a parameterized closed-loop Nash Equilibrium by solving an equivalent single-objective optimal control problem. As a result, our algorithm is 10x faster during training compared to a game-theoretic baseline and converges faster during policy execution.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Hidden Markov Modeling with Equal Exit Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social learning strategies enable agents to infer the underlying true state of nature in a distributed manner by receiving private environmental signals and exchanging beliefs with their neighbors. Previous studies have extensively focused on static environments, where the underlying true state remains unchanged over time. In this paper, we consider a dynamic setting where the true state evolves according to a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities. Based on this assumption, we present a social learning strategy for dynamic environments, termed Diffusion $\alpha$-HMM. By leveraging a simplified parameterization, we derive a nonlinear dynamical system that governs the evolution of the log-belief ratio over time. This formulation further reveals the relationship between the linearized form of Diffusion $\alpha$-HMM and Adaptive Social Learning, a well-established social learning strategy for dynamic environments. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and fixed-point properties of a reference system, providing theoretical guarantees on the learning performance of the proposed algorithm in dynamic settings. Numerical experiments compare various distributed social learning strategies across different dynamic environments, demonstrating the impact of nonlinearity and parameterization on learning performance in a range of dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Some Fundamental Problems for Multi-Agent Systems Over Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many researchers have considered multi-agent systems over single-layer networks as models for studying diffusion phenomena. Since real-world networks involve connections between agents with different semantics (e.g., family member, friend, colleague), the study of multi-agent systems over multilayer networks has assumed importance. Our focus is on one class of multi-agent system models over multilayer networks, namely multilayer synchronous dynamical systems (MSyDSs). We study several fundamental problems for this model. We establish properties of the phase spaces of MSyDSs and bring out interesting differences between single-layer and multilayer dynamical systems. We show that, in general, the problem of determining whether two given MSyDSs are inequivalent is NP-complete. This hardness result holds even when the only difference between the two systems is the local function at just one node in one layer. We also present efficient algorithms for the equivalence problem for restricted versions of MSyDSs (e.g., systems where each local function is a bounded-threshold function, systems where the number of layers is fixed and each local function is symmetric). In addition, we investigate the expressive power of MSyDSs based on the number of layers. In particular, we examine conditions under which a system with k &gt;= 2 layers has an equivalent system with k-1 or fewer layers.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Simulation of UAV Battery Recharging for IoT Applications: Precision Agriculture, Disaster Recovery, and Dengue Vector Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low battery autonomy of Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) can make smart farming (precision agriculture), disaster recovery, and the fighting against dengue vector applications difficult. This article considers two approaches, first enumerating the characteristics observed in these three IoT application types and then modeling an UAV's battery recharge coordination using the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approach. In this way, we propose that each drone inside the swarm does not communicate concerning this recharge coordination decision, reducing energy usage and permitting remote usage. A total of 6000 simulations were run to evaluate how two proposed policies, the BaseLine (BL) and ChargerThershold (CT) coordination recharging policy, behave in 30 situations regarding how each simulation sets conclude the simulation runs and how much time they work until recharging results. CT policy shows more reliable results in extreme system usage. This work conclusion presents the potential of these three IoT applications to achieve their perpetual service without communication between drones and ground stations. This work can be a baseline for future policies and simulation parameter enhancements.</description>

      <title>Practical Abstractions for Model Checking Continuous-Time Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model checking of temporal logics in a well established technique to verify and validate properties of multi-agent systems (MAS). However, practical model checking requires input models of manageable size. In this paper, we extend the model reduction method by variable-based abstraction, proposed recently by Jamroga and Kim, to the verification of real-time systems and properties. To this end, we define a real-time extension of MAS graphs, extend the abstraction procedure, and prove its correctness for the universal fragment of Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL). Besides estimating the theoretical complexity gains, we present an experimental evaluation for a simplified model of the Estonian voting system and verification using the Uppaal model checker.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision-Making: Scenarios, Approaches, Challenges and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.</description>

      <title>Controllable Latent Diffusion for Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validation of autonomous driving systems benefits greatly from the ability to generate scenarios that are both realistic and precisely controllable. Conventional approaches, such as real-world test drives, are not only expensive but also lack the flexibility to capture targeted edge cases for thorough evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable latent diffusion that guides the training of diffusion models via reinforcement learning to automatically generate a diverse and controllable set of driving scenarios for virtual testing. Our approach removes the reliance on large-scale real-world data by generating complex scenarios whose properties can be finely tuned to challenge and assess autonomous vehicle systems. Experimental results show that our approach has the lowest collision rate of $0.098$ and lowest off-road rate of $0.096$, demonstrating superiority over existing baselines. The proposed approach significantly improves the realism, stability and controllability of the generated scenarios, enabling more nuanced safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>GameChat: Multi-LLM Dialogue for Safe, Agile, and Socially Optimal Multi-Agent Navigation in Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe, agile, and socially compliant multi-robot navigation in cluttered and constrained environments remains a critical challenge. This is especially difficult with self-interested agents in decentralized settings, where there is no central authority to resolve conflicts induced by spatial symmetry. We address this challenge by proposing a novel approach, GameChat, which facilitates safe, agile, and deadlock-free navigation for both cooperative and self-interested agents. Key to our approach is the use of natural language communication to resolve conflicts, enabling agents to prioritize more urgent tasks and break spatial symmetry in a socially optimal manner. Our algorithm ensures subgame perfect equilibrium, preventing agents from deviating from agreed-upon behaviors and supporting cooperation. Furthermore, we guarantee safety through control barrier functions and preserve agility by minimizing disruptions to agents' planned trajectories. We evaluate GameChat in simulated environments with doorways and intersections. The results show that even in the worst case, GameChat reduces the time for all agents to reach their goals by over 35% from a naive baseline and by over 20% from SMG-CBF in the intersection scenario, while doubling the rate of ensuring the agent with a higher priority task reaches the goal first, from 50% (equivalent to random chance) to a 100% perfect performance at maximizing social welfare.</description>

      <title>Negotiative Alignment: Embracing Disagreement to Achieve Fairer Outcomes -- Insights from Urban Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.
  Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.</description>

      <title>Identifying Cooperative Personalities in Multi-agent Contexts through Personality Steering with Representation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain autonomous capabilities, their coordination in multi-agent settings becomes increasingly important. However, they often struggle with cooperation, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Inspired by Axelrod's Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) tournaments, we explore how personality traits influence LLM cooperation. Using representation engineering, we steer Big Five traits (e.g., Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) in LLMs and analyze their impact on IPD decision-making. Our results show that higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness improve cooperation but increase susceptibility to exploitation, highlighting both the potential and limitations of personality-based steering for aligning AI agents.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Task Allocation for Teams of Multi-mode Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel multi-robot task allocation framework for robots that can switch between multiple modes, e.g., flying, driving, or walking. We first provide a method to encode the multi-mode property of robots as a graph, where the mode of each robot is represented by a node. Next, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to decide both the task to be allocated to each robot as well as the mode in which the latter should execute the task. The robot modes are optimized based on the state of the robot and the environment, as well as the energy required to execute the allocated task. Moreover, the proposed framework is able to encompass kinematic and dynamic models of robots alike. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of task execution and allocation for both robot models.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Sample Efficiency in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has shown promise in learning cooperative behaviors in team-based environments. However, such methods often demand extensive training time. For instance, the state-of-the-art method TiZero takes 40 days to train high-quality policies for a football environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that better exploration mechanisms can improve the sample efficiency of multi-agent methods. We propose two different approaches for better exploration in TiZero: a self-supervised intrinsic reward and a random network distillation bonus. Additionally, we introduce architectural modifications to the original algorithm to enhance TiZero's computational efficiency. We evaluate the sample efficiency of these approaches through extensive experiments. Our results show that random network distillation improves training sample efficiency by 18.8% compared to the original TiZero. Furthermore, we evaluate the qualitative behavior of the models produced by both variants against a heuristic AI, with the self-supervised reward encouraging possession and random network distillation leading to a more offensive performance. Our results highlights the applicability of our random network distillation variant in practical settings. Lastly, due to the nature of the proposed method, we acknowledge its use beyond football simulation, especially in environments with strong multi-agent and strategic aspects.</description>

      <title>LIVEPOINT: Fully Decentralized, Safe, Deadlock-Free Multi-Robot Control in Cluttered Environments with High-Dimensional Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully decentralized, safe, and deadlock-free multi-robot navigation in dynamic, cluttered environments is a critical challenge in robotics. Current methods require exact state measurements in order to enforce safety and liveness e.g. via control barrier functions (CBFs), which is challenging to achieve directly from onboard sensors like lidars and cameras. This work introduces LIVEPOINT, a decentralized control framework that synthesizes universal CBFs over point clouds to enable safe, deadlock-free real-time multi-robot navigation in dynamic, cluttered environments. Further, LIVEPOINT ensures minimally invasive deadlock avoidance behavior by dynamically adjusting agents' speeds based on a novel symmetric interaction metric. We validate our approach in simulation experiments across highly constrained multi-robot scenarios like doorways and intersections. Results demonstrate that LIVEPOINT achieves zero collisions or deadlocks and a 100% success rate in challenging settings compared to optimization-based baselines such as MPC and ORCA and neural methods such as MPNet, which fail in such environments. Despite prioritizing safety and liveness, LIVEPOINT is 35% smoother than baselines in the doorway environment, and maintains agility in constrained environments while still being safe and deadlock-free.</description>

      <title>MAP: Evaluation and Multi-Agent Enhancement of Large Language Models for Inpatient Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians. Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.</description>

      <title>Can A Society of Generative Agents Simulate Human Behavior and Inform Public Health Policy? A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy</title>

Abstract: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.</description>

      <title>Distributed Random Reshuffling Methods with Improved Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two distributed random reshuffling methods, namely Gradient Tracking with Random Reshuffling (GT-RR) and Exact Diffusion with Random Reshuffling (ED-RR), to solve the distributed optimization problem over a connected network, where a set of agents aim to minimize the average of their local cost functions. Both algorithms invoke random reshuffling (RR) update for each agent, inherit favorable characteristics of RR for minimizing smooth nonconvex objective functions, and improve the performance of previous distributed random reshuffling methods both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, both GT-RR and ED-RR achieve the convergence rate of $O(1/[(1-\lambda)^{1/3}m^{1/3}T^{2/3}])$ in driving the (minimum) expected squared norm of the gradient to zero, where $T$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ is the sample size for each agent, and $1-\lambda$ represents the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. When the objective functions further satisfy the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we show GT-RR and ED-RR both achieve $O(1/[(1-\lambda)mT^2])$ convergence rate in terms of the averaged expected differences between the agents' function values and the global minimum value. Notably, both results are comparable to the convergence rates of centralized RR methods (up to constant factors depending on the network topology) and outperform those of previous distributed random reshuffling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social balance is a well-established concept in sociology which dictates how individual interactions can lead a population to become one faction of positive interactions or be divided in two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we find that achieving social balance depends on (i) the type of interaction; (ii) whether agents consider homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the population size. We characterize how each model achieves social balance with different frequency, diversity of positive or negative interactions, and interaction stability across conditions (i) to (iii). We show that models achieve different notions of social balance and justify their social dynamics differently. Remarkably, the largest model is not necessarily more likely to achieve social balance with more frequency, stability, and diversity than the smaller ones.</description>

      <title>Two-person Positive Shortest Path Games Have Nash Equilibria in Pure Stationary Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every finite two-person shortest path game, where the local cost of every move is positive for each player, has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in pure stationary strategies, which can be computed in polynomial time. We also extend the existence result to infinite graphs with finite out-degrees. Moreover, our proof gives that a terminal NE (in which the play is a path from the initial position to a terminal) exists provided at least one of the two players can guarantee reaching a terminal. If none of the players can do it, in other words, if each of the two players has a strategy that separates all terminals from the initial position $s$, then, obviously, a cyclic NE exists, although its cost is infinite for both players, since we restrict ourselves to positive games. We conjecture that a terminal NE exists too, provided there exists a directed path from $s$ to a terminal. However, this is open.
  We extend our result to short paths interdiction games, where at each vertex, we allow one player to block some of the arcs and the other player to choose one of the non-blocked arcs. Assuming that blocking sets are chosen from an independence system given by an oracle, we give an algorithm for computing a NE in time $O(|E|(\log|V|+\tau))$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of arcs, and $\tau$ is the maximum time taken by the oracle on any input.</description>

      <title>Order Fairness Evaluation of DAG-based ledgers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the order in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are eventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered. The study of such properties is relatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments. Indeed, in many classical blockchain protocols, leaders are responsible for selecting the transactions to be included in blocks, which creates a clear vulnerability and opportunity for transaction order manipulation.
  Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to independently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed acyclic graph. Interestingly, leaders in DAG-based ledgers are elected only after the fact, once transactions are already part of the graph, to determine their total order. In other words, transactions are not chosen by single leaders; instead, they are collectively validated by the nodes, and leaders are only elected to establish an ordering. This approach intuitively reduces the risk of transaction manipulation and enhances fairness.
  In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to achieve order fairness. To this end, we define new variants of order fairness adapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of compromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to reorder transactions. We analyze how often our order fairness properties are violated under different network conditions and parameterizations of the DAG algorithm, depending on the adversary's power.
  Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering attacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to manipulate the DAG's structure.</description>

      <title>VLMs Play StarCraft II: A Benchmark and Multimodal Decision Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VLM-Attention, a multimodal StarCraft II environment that aligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience. Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2.</description>
