      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Based Circuit Model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Damped photonic modes in helicoidal graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helicoidal spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helicoidal graphene structures. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Monopole current control in artificial spin ice via localized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice systems are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets arranged on a lattice, exhibiting geometrical frustration and emergent phenomena such as monopole excitations. We explore magnetization dynamics and monopole current control in square artificial spin ice with added vertical control elements. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine how localized magnetic fields from these elements influence vertex configurations and domain propagation, enabling directional and polarity control of monopole currents. The control elements suppress monopole nucleation along one edge, steering monopole flow across the lattice, sometimes even against the applied field direction. These elements also reshape the system's energy landscape, producing tailored hysteresis and guided state transitions. Our results offer a strategy for manipulating collective behaviours in artificial spin ice using localized fields. This has implications for magnetic memory, physical reservoir computing, enabling reconfigurable magnetic logic and spin-based information processing, and device architectures requiring directional magnetic charge transport.</description>

      <title>Competing Many-Body Phases at Small Fillings in Ultrahigh-Quality GaAs 2D Hole Systems: Role of Landau Level Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS), an incompressible liquid state hosting anyonic excitations with fractional charge and statistics, represents a compelling many-body phase observed in clean two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems. The expected non-Abelian nature of the FQHSs at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings has particularly sparked considerable recent interest. At sufficiently small fillings, another exotic phase, namely a quantum Wigner crystal (WC) state, dominates. Here we report magneto-transport measurements in an ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D \textit{hole} system where the large hole effective mass leads to a significant LL mixing (LLM) even at very high magnetic fields and affects the many-body states at very small fillings. We observe numerous developing FQHSs at both even- and odd-denominator fillings, deep in the insulating regime at $\nu \lesssim$ 1/3 where WC states dominate. The FQHSs we observe at odd-denominator fillings on the flanks of $\nu=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are consistent with the Abelian Jain sequence of four-flux and six-flux composite fermions, while the ones at even-denominator fillings $\nu=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are likely non-Abelian states emerging from the pairing of these quasiparticles induced by severe LLM. Our results demonstrate that the competition between the FQHSs and WC phases is close at very small fillings even in the presence of severe LLM. We also measure activation energies of WC states near $\nu=$ 1/6, and find that they are substantially larger than what has been reported for ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D electrons. A moderate LLM is believed to lower the activation energy associated to the formation of WC intrinsic defects. The surprisingly large activation energy for our 2DHS with significant LLM is therefore puzzling, and may suggest a different type of intrinsic WC defect compared to that in 2D electrons.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved measurement of single electrons using a modulated barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the wave packet of high-energy electrons in solid-state devices is important for quantum information processing. Time-resolved measurements with high time resolutions and small errors typically require detectors with a large RF bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate a precise and time-efficient time-resolved method, where an accuracy in measurements are not limited by the bandwidth. By analyzing the energy variance derived from transconductance measurements under a sinusoidal gate voltage applied to a detector barrier, we extract key characteristics of single-electron states. It includes a temporal variance and the covariance between energy and time. The results are consistent with those obtained using a hyperbolic tangent shaped (linearly varying) gate voltage. The proposed approach provides a simple yet precise method for probing the single-electron states. The present findings will be useful for identifying suitable waveforms for applications in electron quantum optics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.</description>

      <title>Valley-polarized Quantum Anomalous Hall and Topological Metal Phase in Rashba induced pseudospin-1 lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern numbers, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-1 system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</description>

      <title>Symmetry broken states at high displacement fields in ABA trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a comprehensive study of magnetotransport in high-mobility trilayer graphene (TLG) devices under a transverse displacement field, focusing on symmetry-broken Landau levels (LLs) from monolayer-like and bilayer-like bands. A striking displacement-field-induced enhancement of the Land\'e g-factor is observed in the zeroth Landau level of the monolayer-like band, highlighting the role of strong electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we find a rich landscape of LL crossings in the Dirac gully region, accompanied by phase transitions between spin-, gully-, and valley-polarized LLs. These experimental observations are successfully modeled using calculations based on optimized tight-binding parameters. Furthermore, our results reveal significant particle-hole asymmetry in the sequence of LLs in the Dirac gullies, attributed to differing g-factor values for electrons and holes. This asymmetry underscores the limitations of non-interacting models in capturing the complexities of strongly correlated multiband systems. This work provides new insights into the interplay of symmetry-breaking mechanisms and strong correlations in Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene, advancing our understanding of quantum transport phenomena in multiband systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Saddletronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low energy valleys in the band structure of 2d materials represent a potential route to the ultrafast writing of information in quantum matter by laser light, with excited charge at the K or K$^\ast$ valleys representing the fundamental states of 1 and 0. Here we demonstrate that a second electronic feature, the saddle point, is endowed with lightwave control over information states. Linearly polarized light is shown to excite 2 of the 3 inequivalent M point saddles in graphene, generating three possible excited configurations, with which of these are realised determined by the polarization vector direction. We show that saddle excitation is highly robust, with "saddle polarized" states created both in the sub-cycle strong field regime and the long time limit of extended multi-cycle pulses. Our findings, applicable to other members of the graphene family and Xenes such as stanene, point towards a rich and ultrafast light based manipulation of matter based on the saddle point.</description>

      <title>The role of the effective mass in two-dimensional Dirac electric quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a different effective mass inside and outside an electric quantum dot on in its energy spectrum. Depending on the different values we give to the mass, we have found quite different spectra. Specifically, when the mass is positive but lighter inside the dot than outside it, the spectrum increases and splits into two types of states separated by a gap. Conversely, if the mass inside the quantum dot is heavier than the mass outside, the spectrum has fewer states and needs stronger fields in order to confine states. Finally, the case of inverted mass (ie, negative mass inside the quantum dot and positive outside it or vice versa) gives rise to a new spectral curve of edge states. All these cases have been analyzed in detail along this paper.</description>

      <title>Alloying as a new route to generating interlayer excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel route for the generation of interlayer excitons based on the synthesis of a transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer alloy material, WS$_{2x}$Se$_{2(1-x)}$. Using piezoelectric force microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of an internal electric field oriented in the out-of-plane direction. Interlayer excitons have so far been mostly observed in heterostructures with a type-II band alignment. In the presence of an internal electric field, a similar alignment occurs in the alloy bilayer resulting in an efficient generation of interlayer excitons. Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements involving circularly polarised light come up with key observations like a negative degree of circular polarization of the interlayer excitons which increases as a function of temperature. A simple theoretical model provides a physical understanding of the major experimentally observed features. With experimentally fitted parameter values, the dominant contribution to the degree of circular polarization is shown to arise from spin polarization and not from valley polarization, a consequence of the spin-valley-layer coupling characteristic of a TMDC bilayer.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic light-tailored RKKY interaction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are known in spintronics for their intrinsic spin-splitting and unconventional magnetic responses, particularly to magnetic impurities. However, effectively controlling the magnetic exchange interactions in altermagnets is challenging for practical applications. Here, we propose using circularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space retarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg and Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction also plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism imprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be dynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and anisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other exchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by $45^\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a Dirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions. We finally extract critical thresholds where light reverses DM interactions along one axis or balances both in-plane components. The anisotropic light-driven control of RKKY interactions in 2D altermagnets not only highlights their unique properties but also opens new avenues for engineering tailored magnetic characteristics in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via Krylov spread complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the PT-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Probing cellular activity via charge-sensitive quantum nanoprobes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.</description>

      <title>Hybrid interfaces at the single quantum level in fluorescent molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to fluctuation theorems: from theory to experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is a fundamental branch of physics, and over the years, it has evolved to include mesoscopic and out-of-equilibrium systems driven by theoretical and experimental advances at the micro- and nanoscale. This development has led to \textit{stochastic thermodynamics}, a framework that connects microscopic fluctuations with macroscopic laws. Despite their significance, fundamental ideas, such as fluctuation theorems, are frequently not covered in current curricula, leaving them largely unknown across many disciplines. Here, we present the core results of stochastic thermodynamics, particularly the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks theorem, using an integrated approach combining theoretical foundations with experimental verification using optical tweezers. This approach helps to clarify the fundamentals, linking theoretical ideas to real elements in the lab, showing the simplicity of the apparatus, and presenting detailed procedures for calibration and calculation of relevant quantities to enable the implementation of these experiments in new research and teaching laboratories. The goal is to enrich thermodynamics education and to stimulate exploration in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Modeling Practical Capacitive Structures for Electronic and Dielectric Property Extraction and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for modeling the full steady-state and small-signal behavior of practical capacitive structures, such as metal-insulator-metal capacitors, diodes, and transistors, is presented. Simple lumped element models fail to properly represent the behavior of most practical structures, resulting in incorrect electronic material property extraction and evaluation. The methodology and model presented in this paper properly characterizes practical structures and can be employed to more accurately understand and evaluate experimental results, extract various electronic and dielectric properties of the constituent materials, and predict possible behavior of new structures and materials. The impact of dielectric properties (e.g., real versus complex permittivity, conductance, Cole-Cole dielectric response) and geometry on observed behavior of practical structures, especially with regard to extracting correct property values, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states and supercurrent in an unconventional superconductor-altermagnetic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the orientation-dependent properties of d-wave superconductors (SCs), we investigate Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Josephson current in s-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (S/AM/D) and d-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (D/AM/D) junctions. The asymmetric S/AM/D junction exhibits a node-less ABSs spectrum with distinct spin states, arising from AM manipulation. In contrast, a symmetric D/AM/D junction with $\pm 45^\circ$-oriented order parameters exhibits a nodal ABSs spectrum, characterized by spin-split sinusoidal curves. This behavior arises from the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing potential, which introduces a $\pi$-shift in the ABSs spectrum of the D/AM/D junction compared to that of conventional S/AM/S junctions. Additionally, the positions of the ABSs nodes in the D/AM/D junction can be controlled by adjusting the length and strength of the AM layer. Analysis of the free energy and Josephson current reveals additional extrema in the free energy at intermediate phase differences, leading to skewness and a non-sinusoidal behavior in the current-phase relationship of both configurations. These zero-supercurrent phase differences can be tuned by adjusting the properties of the AM layer such as AM strength and length. These findings provide new insights into AM-based Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</description>

      <title>Optical control of orbital magnetism in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands in graphene-based moir\'e structures host a wide range of emerging strongly correlated and topological phenomena. Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moir\'e fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.</description>

Abstract: Separating heat from charge in a material is an extremely challenging task since they are transported by the very same carriers, i.e. electrons or holes. In this Letter we show that such separation can reach 100% efficiency in a hybrid superconducting quantum Hall setup, provided that the quantum Hall system is tuned to integer filling factor. We present microscopic calculations for a three-terminal setup to illustrate our idea.</description>

      <title>Electric conductivity in graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare three models of graphene electric conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Falkovsky, and finally, a non-local quantum field theory (QFT) polarization-based model. These models are supposed to provide consistent results since they are derived from the same Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper $\textbf{q}\to\textbf{0}$ limit of both the non-local Kubo and the non-local QFT model (once losses are added to this last model), we find hard inconsistencies in the non-local QFT model as derived and currently used in literature. In particular, in the genuine non-local region ($\textbf{q}\neq\textbf{0}$), the available QFT model shows an intrinsic non-physical plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal electric conductivity at low frequencies (even after introducing the unavoidable losses). The Kubo model, instead, shows the expected behavior, i.e., an almost constant electric conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega&lt;\sqrt{(\hbar v_F q)^{2}+4m^{2}}$. We show that the Kubo and QFT models can be expressed using an identical Polarization operator $\Pi_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$, but they employ different expressions for the electric conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$. In particular, the Kubo model uses a standard regularized expression, a direct consequence of Ohm's Law and causality, as we rigorously re-derive. We show that, once the standard regularized expression for $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(\omega,\textbf{q})$ is used in the QFT model, and losses are included, the Kubo and QFT model coincide, and all its anomalies naturally disappear. Our findings show the necessity to appropriately define and regularize the electric conductivity to connect it with the available QFT model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum heat engines, and quantum sensors, rely on operating conditions in the subkelvin regime. It is therefore desirable to develop practical tools and methods for the precise control of the temperature in nanoscale quantum systems. Here, we present a proposal for fast, accurate, and local temperature control using qubits, which regulate the flow of heat between a quantum system and its thermal environment. The qubits are kept in a thermal state with a temperature that is controlled in an interplay between work done on the qubits by changing their energy splittings and the flow of heat between the qubits and the environment. Using only a few qubits, it is possible to control the thermal environment of another quantum system, which can be heated or cooled by the qubits. As an example, we show how a quantum system at subkelvin temperatures can be significantly and accurately cooled on a nanosecond timescale. Our proposal can potentially be realized with superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, or spin qubits, which can now be fabricated and manipulated with exquisite control.</description>

      <title>Magnetic- and electric-field-induced anomalous Hall currents from optical excitation of Landau transitions in bulk GaAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a certain type of anomalous Hall current in magnetically- and electrically-biased bulk GaAs samples under the formation of Landau levels. The currents are generated by ultrafast optical excitation of spin-polarized carriers and detected by time-resolved measurements of the simultaneously emitted THz radiation. Due to the requirements of simultaneous magnetic and electric driving fields we refer to these currents as BE-AHC. We find that the BE-AHC peak for optical transitions between the band extrema of Landau levels of valance and conduction bands. These discrete features are attributed to the energy dependence of the geometric phases being responsible for anomalous transport effects in a semiconductor bandstructure. Surprisingly, we even detect the discrete Landau band transitions at room temperature, most likely due to the ultrafast local probing realized in our experiment. An analysis of the THz spectra using a model, based on the Boltzmann transport equation of optically excited carriers, shows that electron and hole contributions lead to complex current dynamics. While the cyclotronic motion of electrons results in a dip in the THz spectral response of BE-AHC, it causes a peak in the spectral response of normal Hall currents. Additionally, our experimental results strongly suggest that the Landau levels of the valance band play a significant role in the generation of BE-AHC. We expect that our results will initiate further studies on Berry-phase effects in Landau bands.</description>

Abstract: We study the stationary state of an ac-driven two-level system under particle exchange with a fermionic environment. A particular question addressed is whether there exist limits in which the populations of the Floquet states are determined by their quasienergies or their mean energies, respectively. The focus lies on parameters in the vicinity of conical intersections of quasienergies, because there the two kinds of energies behave rather differently, such that the characteristics of the two intuitive limits are most pronounced. A main finding is a crossover from a Floquet-Gibbs-like state at low temperatures to a mean-energy dominated state at intermediate temperatures. Analytical estimates are confirmed by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate and real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin lateral heterostructures of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 have successfully been realized with the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition method. Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM observations have revealed that the junction widths of lateral heterostructures range from several nanometers to single-atom thickness, the thinnest heterojunction in theory. The interfaces are atomically flat with minimal mixing between MoS2 and WS2, originating from rapid and abrupt switching of the source supply. Due to one-dimensional interfaces and broken rotational symmetry, the resulting ultrathin lateral heterostructures, 1~2 mixed-dimensional structures, can show emergent optical/electronic properties. The MOCVD growth developed in this work allows us to access various ultrathin lateral heterostructures, leading to future exploration of their emergent properties absent in each component alone.</description>

Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>
