      <title>3D Variational Inference-Based Double-Difference Seismic Tomography Method and Application to the SAFOD Site, California</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic tomography is a crucial technique used to image subsurface structures at various scales, accomplished by solving a nonlinear and nonunique inverse problem. It is therefore important to quantify velocity model uncertainties for accurate earthquake locations and geological interpretations. Monte Carlo sampling techniques are usually used for this purpose, but those methods are computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In comparison, Bayesian variational inference provides a more efficient alternative by delivering probabilistic solutions through optimization. The method has been proven to be efficient in 2D tomographic problems. In this study, we apply variational inference to solve 3D double-difference (DD) seismic tomographic system using both absolute and differential travel time data. Synthetic tests demonstrate that the new method can produce more accurate velocity models than the original DD tomography method by avoiding regularization constraints, and at the same time provides more reliable uncertainty estimates. Compared to traditional checkerboard resolution tests, the resulting uncertainty estimates measure more accurately the reliability of the solution. We further apply the new method to data recorded by a local dense seismic array around the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) site along the San Andreas Fault (SAF) at Parkfield. Similar to other researches, the obtained velocity models show significant velocity contrasts across the fault. More importantly, the new method produces velocity uncertainties of less than 0.34 km/s for Vp and 0.23 km/s for Vs. We therefore conclude that variational inference provides a powerful and efficient tool for solving 3D seismic tomographic problems and quantifying model uncertainties.</description>

      <title>An axiomatic method for studying the truth or falsity of the Hirano-Utsu law describing aftershocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power law of aftershock evolution was proposed by Hirano in 1924 and introduced by Utsu into seismology in the second half of the last century. The Hirano-Utsu law is widely used in studying the relaxation of earthquake source after the main shock of an earthquake. The prevailing view in the literature is that the Hirano-Utsu law is an improved version of Omori's hyperbolic law, formulated in 1894. The author disagrees with this notion. The paper proposes an axiomatic approach to the study of aftershocks. A phenomenological parameter of the source, called the deactivation coefficient, was introduced. The theory is based on axioms that do not contain any a priori statements regarding the form of the law of aftershock evolution. Formulas for the deactivation coefficient are derived from the axioms, allowing one to experimentally establish the truth or falsity of the Hirano-Utsu and Omori laws. A two-stage mode of source relaxation was discovered. In the first stage, called the Omori epoch, the Omori law is strictly followed. The Omori epoch ends with a bifurcation, after which aftershock activity becomes unpredictable. Omori's law is not fulfilled at the second stage of evolution. The Hirano-Utsu law is not fulfilled either at the first or second stage. Keywords: earthquake source, main shock, relaxation, deactivation coefficient, evolution equation, inverse problem, Omori epoch, bifurcation, two-stage relaxation mode.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model for Seismic Imaging Improvement of Sparsely Acquired Data and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic imaging from sparsely acquired data faces challenges such as low image quality, discontinuities, and migration swing artifacts. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods struggle with complex feature distributions and cannot effectively assess uncertainty, making it hard to evaluate the reliability of their processed results. To address these issues, we propose a new method using a generative diffusion model (GDM). Here, in the training phase, we use the imaging results from sparse data as conditional input, combined with noisy versions of dense data imaging results, for the network to predict the added noise. After training, the network can predict the imaging results for test images from sparse data acquisition, using the generative process with conditional control. This GDM not only improves image quality and removes artifacts caused by sparse data, but also naturally evaluates uncertainty by leveraging the probabilistic nature of the GDM. To overcome the decline in generation quality and the memory burden of large-scale images, we develop a patch fusion strategy that effectively addresses these issues. Synthetic and field data examples demonstrate that our method significantly enhances imaging quality and provides effective uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently established that self-healing slip pulses under uniform prestress $\tau_b$ are unstable frictional rupture modes, i.e., they either slowly expand/decay with time t. Furthermore, their dynamics were shown to follow a reduced-dimensionality description corresponding to a special $L(c)$ line in a plane defined by the pulse propagation velocity $c(t)$ and size $L(t)$. Yet, uniform prestress is rather the exception than the rule in natural faults. We study the effects of a spatially-varying prestress $\tau_b(x)$ on 2D slip pulses, initially generated under a uniform $\tau_b$ along a rate-and-state friction fault. We consider periodic and constant-gradient prestress $\tau_b(x)$ around the reference uniform $\tau_b$. For a periodic $\tau_b(x)$, pulses either sustain and form quasi-limit cycles in the $L-c$ plane or decay predominantly monotonically along the $L(c)$ line, depending on the instability index of the initial pulse and the properties of the periodic $\tau_b(x)$. For a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, expanding/decaying pulses closely follow the $L(c)$ line, with systematic shifts determined by the sign and magnitude of the gradient. We also find that a spatially-varying $\tau_b(x)$ can revert the expanding/decaying nature of the initial reference pulse. Finally, we show that a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, of sufficient magnitude and specific sign, can lead to the nucleation of a back-propagating rupture at the healing tail of the initial pulse, generating a bilateral crack-like rupture. This pulse-to-crack transition, along with the above-described effects, demonstrate that rich rupture dynamics merge from a simple, nonuniform prestress. Furthermore, we show that as long as pulses exist, their dynamics are related to the special $L(c)$ line, providing an effective, reduced-dimensionality description of unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestress.</description>

      <title>SWRC Fit and unsatfit for parameter determination of unsaturated soil properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SWRC Fit and unsatfit are programs developed for determining parameters of the water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions of soils for analyzing water movement in the unsaturated soil. The SWRC Fit is a web application for drawing SWRC (soil water retention curves) of various soil hydraulic models from the measured data with just one click, available at https://purl.org/net/swrc/. The SWRC Fit depends on the Python library unsatfit that implements various types of soil hydraulic models to determine water retention and hydraulic conductivity parameters by nonlinear least-square optimization. The implemented models are classified as DF3 (Brooks and Corey, van Genuchten, Kosugi) models, DF4 (Fredlund, Fayer, Peters, bimodal-CH) models, and DF5 (bimodal) models by the degree of freedom of the water retention functions. Most of the hydraulic conductivity functions are derived from the water retention function and the general hydraulic conductivity function. A modified model to suppress extreme changes in hydraulic conductivity in the near-saturated range can be applied to any hydraulic model. The algorithm that was proved to work with various types of soils in Seki et al. (2023) is provided as the sample Python codes. This paper describes how to use SWRC Fit and unsatfit.</description>

      <title>libEMMI_MGFD: A program of marine controlled-source electromagnetic modelling and inversion using frequency-domain multigrid solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a software package libEMMI\_MGFD for 3D frequency-domain marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modelling and inversion. It is the first open-source C program tailored for geometrical multigrid (GMG) CSEM simulation. An volumetric anisotropic averaging scheme has been employed to compute effective medium for modelling over uniform and nonuniform grid. The computing coordinate is aligned with acquisition geometry by rotation with the azimuth and dip angles, facilitating the injection of the source and the extraction of data with arbitrary orientations. Efficient nonlinear optimization is achieved using quasi-Newton scheme assisted with bisection backtracking line search. In constructing the modularized Maxwell solver and evaluating the misfit and gradient for 3D CSEM inversion, the reverse communication technique is the key to the compaction of the software while maintaining the computational performance. A number of numeric tests demonstrate the efficiency of the modelling while preserving the solution accuracy. A 3D marine CSEM inversion example has been examined for resistivity imaging.</description>
