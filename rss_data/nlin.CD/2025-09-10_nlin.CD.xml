      <title>Statistical properties of homoclinic bursting: an approach using infinite-modal maps toward predicting extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems is challenging due to a limited understanding of their statistical properties. This study numerically and theoretically investigates the statistical properties of infinite-modal maps arising from homoclinic bursting to predict extreme events. The numerical investigation presents bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, height probability distributions, and interevent interval probability distributions for infinite-modal maps. The theoretical analysis derives analytical formulae for these statistical properties using a randomized infinite-modal map, which builds upon the randomization theory of infinite-modal maps developed in a previous study. Furthermore, a parameter estimation method for infinite-modal maps is proposed, utilizing the derived analytical formula, which enables practical application of the theoretical results. Finally, the study demonstrates the applicability of the approach in analyzing non-stationary data with time-dependent parameters. These findings provide a foundation for mechanism-based prediction of extreme events.</description>

      <title>ExSEnt: Extrema-Segmented Entropy Analysis of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), a feature-decomposed framework for quantifying time-series complexity that separates temporal from amplitude contributions. The method partitions a signal into monotonic segments by detecting sign changes in the first-order increments. For each segment, it extracts the interval duration and the net amplitude change, generating two sequences that reflect timing and magnitude variability, respectively. Complexity is then quantified by computing sample entropy on durations and amplitudes, together with their joint entropy. This decomposition reveals whether overall irregularity is driven by timing, amplitude, or their coupling, providing a richer and more interpretable characterization than unidimensional metrics. We validate ExSEnt on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems (Logistic map, Rossler system, Rulkov map), demonstrating its ability to track complexity changes across control parameter sweeps and detect transitions between periodic and chaotic regimes. Then, we illustrate the empirical utility of ExSEnt metrics to isolate feature-specific sources of complexity in real data (electromyography and ankle acceleration in Parkinsons disease). ExSEnt thus complements existing entropy measures by attributing complexity to distinct signal features, improving interpretability and supporting applications in a broad range of domains, including physiology, finance, and geoscience.</description>

      <title>Effect of higher-order interactions on tipping cascades on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tipping points are critical thresholds of parameters where tiny perturbations can lead to abrupt and large qualitative changes in the systems. Many real-world systems that exhibit tipping behavior can be represented as networks of interacting multistable units, such as vegetation patches or infrastructure networks, undergoing both pairwise and higher-order interactions. In this article, we explore how higher-order interactions shape the dynamics of tipping cascades in a conceptual system with tipping points. Numerical simulations on random, scale-free, and small-world networks reveal that higher-order interactions can induce cascades even at coupling strengths, where only pairwise interactions fail to do so. We also investigate the interplay of the pairwise and higher-order coupling strengths in random networks and illustrate the route to cascades through bifurcation diagrams. These results have also been demonstrated on real-world social networks. Apart from this, we show that repulsive higher-order interactions suppress tipping cascades at coupling strengths where pairwise interactions would cause them, and shift the cascade route from a saddle-node to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Our results highlight the critical role of higher-order interactions in shaping cascade dynamics, offering insights for anticipating and mitigating critical transitions in ecosystems, climate systems, and socio-technical infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the timescales and information flow associated with multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system through a greedy optimization algorithm which looks to find the maximum conditional mutual information across lagged embeddings of time series localized by wavenumber. Our results provide a detailed understanding of how wavenumbers couple in order to maintain the weakly turbulent dynamic equilibrium. The algorithm is able to detect and characterize detailed differences of information flow with corresponding distinctions in time scales for both the forward and inverse cascades, and this can be done over both fast and slower time scales. This points to our approach being of broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>
