      <title>Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Accelerated simulation of multiscale gas-radiation coupling flows via a general synthetic iterative scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-radiation coupling critically influences hypersonic reentry flows, where extreme temperatures induce pronounced non-equilibrium gas and radiative heat transport. Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments.</description>

      <title>A constrained-transport embedded boundary method for compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the increased interest in pulsed-power magneto-inertial fusion devices in recent years, we present a method for implementing an arbitrarily shaped embedded boundary on a Cartesian mesh while solving the equations of compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Decline Curve Analysis and Machine Learning for Temperature Forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems: Utah FORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable temperature forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) is essential, yet petroleum-based decline curves and many machine-learning surrogates do not enforce geothermal heat transfer, while thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) simulation remains computationally expensive. This study proposes a physics-consistent framework that advances both decline-curve analysis and surrogate modeling. The classical Arps decline family is generalized for geothermal use by introducing an equilibrium-temperature term motivated by Newton-type cooling, ensuring finite late-time temperature limits while reducing exactly to the conventional Arps forms when the equilibrium term is set to zero. The extended decline curves are validated against Utah FORGE downhole temperature measurements and then used to construct learning surrogates on a controlled THM dataset spanning fracture count, well spacing, fracture spacing, host-rock thermal conductivity, and circulation rate. An equation-informed neural network embeds the modified decline equations as differentiable internal computational layers to produce full 0-60 month temperature trajectories from design and operational inputs. A probabilistic Gaussian Process Regression surrogate is also developed for direct multi-horizon forecasting with calibrated uncertainty, while a direct XGBoost regression baseline provides a purely data-driven reference. Across the simulation dataset, the extended decline models reproduce temperature trajectories with near-perfect fidelity (median RMSE = 0.071 {\deg}C), and the equation-informed network achieves typical hold-out errors of MAE = 3.06 {\deg}C and RMSE = 4.49 {\deg}C. The Gaussian Process surrogate delivers the strongest predictive accuracy across 3-60 month horizons (RMSE = 3.39 {\deg}C; MAE = 2.34 {\deg}C) with well-calibrated uncertainty, whereas the XGBoost baseline exhibits higher errors.</description>

      <title>Constrained dynamics for searching saddle points on general Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory.</description>

      <title>Terahertz volume plasmon-polariton modulation in all-dielectric hyperbolic metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of plasmonics and related applications in the terahertz range faces limitations due to the intrinsic high electron density of standard metals. All-dielectric systems are profitable alternatives, which allows for customized modulation of the optical response upon doping. Here we focus on plasmon-based hyperbolic metamaterials realized stacking doped III-V semiconductors that have been shown to be optically active in the terahertz spectral region. By using a multi-physics multi-scale theoretical approach, we unravel the role of doping and geometrical characteristics (e.g., thickness, composition, grating) in the modulation of high-k plasmon-polariton modes across the metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Neural Networks for Force-Field Models of Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Compression for Spectral Tensor Networks on Cyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to compress cyclic tensor networks called stochastic path compression (SPC) that uses an iterative importance sampling procedure to target edges with large bond-dimensions. Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.</description>

      <title>SAP-X2C: Optimally-Simple Two-Component Relativistic Hamiltonian With Size-Intensive Picture Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple relativistic exact 2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian that models two-electron picture-change effects using Lehtola's superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) [S. Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593-1604 (2019)]. The SAP-X2C approach keeps the low-cost and technical simplicity of the popular 1-electron X2C (1eX2C) predecessor, but is significantly more accurate and has a well-defined thermodynamic limit, making it applicable to extended systems (such as periodic crystals). The assessment of the SAP-X2C-based Hartree-Fock total and spinor energies, spin-orbit splittings, equilibrium bond distances, and harmonic vibrational frequencies suggests that SAP-X2C is similar to the more complex atomic mean-field (AMF) X2C counterparts in the ability to approximate the 4-component Dirac-Hartree-Fock reference.</description>

      <title>Robust Physics Discovery from Highly Corrupted Data: A PINN Framework Applied to the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Modelling and analysis of laser flash experiments using the Cattaneo heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal diffusivity of solid materials is commonly measured using laser flash analysis. This technique involves applying a heat pulse to the front surface of a small sample of the material and calculating the thermal diffusivity from the resulting increase in temperature on the back surface. Current formulas for the thermal diffusivity are based on the assumption that heat is transported within the sample according to the standard heat equation. While this assumption is valid in most practical cases, it admits the non-physical property of infinite propagation speed, that is, the heat pulse applied at the front surface is instantaneously perceived at the back surface. This paper carries out a mathematical analysis to determine the effect of replacing the standard heat equation in laser flash analysis by the Cattaneo heat equation, which exhibits finite propagation speed through the inclusion of a relaxation time in the Fourier law. The main results of the paper include (i) analytical insights into the spatiotemporal behaviour of temperature within the sample and (ii) analytical formulas for determining the thermal diffusivity and relaxation time of the sample. Numerical experiments exploring and verifying the analytical results are presented with supporting MATLAB code made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation.

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>

Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of the $\textit{Less In More Out}$ artificial heart: modeling fabric-based soft robotic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Less In More Out device, a fluidically actuated soft total artificial heart was proposed. This device uses arrays of pouch motors to achieve a positive fluidic lever when pneumatically actuated against physiological hemodynamic conditions. Extensive experimental characterization demonstrated its potential; however, experiments alone cannot resolve the internal mechanical fields that govern device durability and performance. Here, we develop a computational framework to investigate intrinsic device mechanics, such as stress concentrations, strain paths, and fatigue life, and to explore targeted design modifications that improve durability and efficiency. We show that our model reproduces the nonlinear deformation and pressure-volume relationships measured experimentally under varying hemodynamic conditions. Across designs, devices with fewer pouches deliver higher stroke volumes but exhibit up to 50% higher peak von Mises stresses, which reduces their fatigue life. Our simulations further identify heat-sealed seams and buckling regions as durability-limiting features. As a proof of concept, we vary the valve support aspect ratio and relative endocardial-epicardial pouch fabric compliance, reducing the peak von Mises stress by ~10% while maintaining identical physiological outputs and improving mechanical efficiency. Overall, our framework enables detailed evaluation of stress hotspots, buckling, and fatigue life, and offers a foundation for optimizing artificial hearts and other fluidically actuated fabric-based soft robotic devices.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum eigensolver for chemical molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving interacting multi-particle systems is a central challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the computation of ground states and ground-state energies for the He-H+ and H2O molecules using quantum computing techniques. We employ the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented both on a quantum computer simulator and on an IBM quantum device. The resulting energies are benchmarked against exact ground-state energies obtained via classical methods. Simulations of the H2O molecule were performed on Nottingham's High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.</description>
