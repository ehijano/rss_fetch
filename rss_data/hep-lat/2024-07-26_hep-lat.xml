      <title>State preparation of lattice field theories using quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques to state preparation of lattice field theories on quantum computers. As a first example, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state preparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range interactions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the inter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the optimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential speedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In addition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states. Our results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of quantum simulations for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation or the modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at finite masses, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing'' and "no boundary'' proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <title>Effects of Final State Interactions on Landau Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In certain kinematic and particle mass configurations, triangle singularities may lead to line-shapes which mimic the effects of resonances. This well-known effect is scrutinized here in the presence of final-state rescattering. The goal is achieved first by utilizing general arguments provided by Landau equations, and second by applying a modern scattering formalism with explicit two- and three-body unitarity.</description>

      <title>What is the Curvature of 2D Euclidean Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies, leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Separation of Infrared and Bulk in Thermal QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New thermal phase of QCD, featuring scale invariance in the infrared (IR), was proposed to exist both in the pure-glue (N$_f$=0) and the ``real-world" (N$_f$=2+1) settings. Among key aspects of the proposal is that the system in this {\it IR phase} separates into two independent components: the scale-invariant IR part and the non-invariant bulk. Such scenario requires non-analyticities in the theory and, in case of pure-glue QCD, they were found to arise via Anderson-like mobility edges in Dirac spectra ($\lambda_\fir \!=\! 0$, $\pm \lambda_\text{A} \!\neq\! 0$) manifested in dimension function $d_\fir(\lambda)$. Here we present first evidence that this mechanism is also at work in ``real-world QCD" (N$_f$=2+1 theory at physical quark masses and $a\!=\!0.105\,$fm), supporting the existence of the proposed IR regime. Indeed, at $T\!=\!234\,$MeV, we find the dimensional jump between zero modes and lowest near-zero modes very close to unity ($d_\fir\!=\!3$ to $d_\fir \!\simeq \!2$), exactly like in pure-glue QCD in IR phase. However, no jump is found at $T\!=\!187\,$ MeV which is in the intermediate region between chiral crossover at $T_c \approx 155\,$MeV and the onset $T_\fir$ of IR phase, originally estimated at $200 &lt; T_\fir &lt; 250\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.03484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically evaluate the expectation value of a baryonic Wilson loop in a holographic model of an SU(3) pure gauge theory. We then discuss three aspects of a static three-quark potential: an aspect of universality which concerns properties independent of a geometric configuration of quarks; a heavy diquark structure; and a relation between the three and two-quark potentials.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ photoproduction: threshold to very high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ photoproduction, which exposes the $c \bar c$ content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to c\bar c + \mathbb P \to J/\psi$ and couples the intermediate $c \bar c$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P $) exchange, is used to deliver a description of available data, viz. both differential and total cross sections from near threshold, where data has newly been acquired, to invariant mass $W \approx 300\,$GeV. The study suggests that it is premature to link existing $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are necessary before the validity of any such connections can be assessed.</description>
