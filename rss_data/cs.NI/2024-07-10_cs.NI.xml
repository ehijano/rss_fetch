      <title>ORAN-Bench-13K: An Open Source Benchmark for Assessing LLMs in Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can revolutionize how we deploy and operate Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) by enhancing network analytics, anomaly detection, and code generation and significantly increasing the efficiency and reliability of a plethora of O-RAN tasks. In this paper, we present ORAN-Bench-13K, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of O-RAN. Our benchmark consists of 13,952 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions generated from 116 O-RAN specification documents. We leverage a novel three-stage LLM framework, and the questions are categorized into three distinct difficulties to cover a wide spectrum of ORAN-related knowledge. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini, Chat-GPT, and Mistral. Additionally, we propose ORANSight, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline that demonstrates superior performance on ORAN-Bench-13K compared to other tested closed-source models. Our findings indicate that current popular LLM models are not proficient in O-RAN, highlighting the need for specialized models. We observed a noticeable performance improvement when incorporating the RAG-based ORANSight pipeline, with a Macro Accuracy of 0.784 and a Weighted Accuracy of 0.776, which was on average 21.55% and 22.59% better than the other tested LLMs.</description>

      <title>Effects of Small-Scale User Mobility on Highly Directional XR Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of next-generation communication systems promises to enable extended reality (XR) applications, such as XR gaming with ultra-realistic content and human-grade sensory feedback. These demanding applications impose stringent performance requirements on the underlying wireless communication infrastructure. To meet the expected Quality of Experience (QoE) for XR applications, high-capacity connections are necessary, which can be achieved by using millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands and employing highly directional beams. However, these narrow beams are susceptible to even minor misalignments caused by small-scale user mobility, such as changes in the orientation of the XR head-mounted device (HMD) or minor shifts in user body position. This article explores the impact of small-scale user mobility on mmWave connectivity for XR and reviews approaches to resolve the challenges arising due to small-scale mobility. To deepen our understanding of small-scale mobility during XR usage, we prepared a dataset of user mobility during XR gaming. We use this dataset to study the effects of user mobility on highly directional communication, identifying specific aspects of user mobility that significantly affect the performance of narrow-beam wireless communication systems. Our results confirm the substantial influence of small-scale mobility on beam misalignment, highlighting the need for enhanced mechanisms to effectively manage the consequences of small-scale mobility.</description>

      <title>SKYCASTLE: Taming LEO Mobility to Facilitate Seamless and Low-latency Satellite Internet Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging integrated space and terrestrial networks (ISTN) built upon low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations aim at providing planet-wide Internet services, not only for residential users, but also for mobile users (e.g., in airplane and cruise scenarios). Efficiently managing global mobility and keeping connections active for mobile users is critical for ISTN operators. However, our quantitative analysis identifies that existing mobility management (MM) schemes suffer from frequent connection interruptions and long latency in ISTN scenarios. The fundamental challenge stems from a unique characteristic of ISTNs: not only users are mobile, but also core network infrastructures (i.e., LEO satellites) are frequently changing their locations in the network. To facilitate seamless and low-latency satellite Internet services, this paper presents SKYCASTLE, a novel network-based global mobility management mechanism. SKYCASTLE incorporates two key techniques to address frequent connection interruptions in ISTNs. First, to reduce the interruption time, SKYCASTLE adopts distributed satellite anchors to track the location changes of mobile nodes, manage handovers and avoid routing convergence. Second, SKYCASTLE leverages an anchor manager to schedule MM functionalities at satellites to reduce deployment costs while guaranteeing low latency. Extensive evaluations combining real constellation information and mobile user trajectories show that: SKYCASTLE can improve up to 55.8% uninterrupted time and reduce 47.8% latency as compared to other existing MM solutions.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Network Service Degradation: An Intra-Flow Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a novel method for predicting service degradation (SD) in computer networks by leveraging early flow features. Our approach focuses on the observable (O) segments of network flows, particularly analyzing Packet Inter-Arrival Time (PIAT) values and other derived metrics, to infer the behavior of non-observable (NO) segments. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we identify an optimal O/NO split threshold of 10 observed delay samples, balancing prediction accuracy and resource utilization. Evaluating models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, we find XGBoost outperforms others, achieving an F1-score of 0.74, balanced accuracy of 0.84, and AUROC of 0.97. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating comprehensive early flow features and the potential of our method to offer a practical solution for monitoring network traffic in resource-constrained environments. This approach ensures enhanced user experience and network performance by preemptively addressing potential SD, providing the basis for a robust framework for maintaining high-quality network services.</description>

      <title>Modeling configuration-performance relation in a mobile network: a data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile network performance modeling typically assumes either a fixed cell's configuration or only considers a limited number of parameters. This prohibits the exploration of multidimensional, diverse configuration space for, e.g., optimization purposes.
  This paper presents a method for performance predictions based on a network cell's configuration and network conditions, which utilizes neural network architecture. We evaluate the idea by extensive experiments, with data from more than 50,000 5G cells. The assessment included a comparison of the proposed method against models developed for fixed configuration. Results show that combined configuration-performance modeling outperforms single-configuration models and allows for performance prediction of unknown configurations, i.e., it is not used for model training. A substantially lower mean absolute error was achieved (0.25 vs. 0.45 for fixed-configuration MLP-based models).</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Resource Allocation in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations into 5G and Beyond is essential to achieve truly global connectivity. A distinctive characteristic of LEO mega-constellations is that they constitute a global infrastructure with predictable dynamics, which enables the pre-planned allocation of the radio resources. However, the different bands that can be used for ground-to-satellite communication are affected differently by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation, which introduces uncertainty on the attenuation of the communication links at high frequencies. Based on this, we present a compelling case for applying integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in heterogeneous and multi-layer LEO satellite constellations over wide areas. Specifically, we present an ISAC framework and frame structure to accurately estimate the attenuation in the communication links due to precipitation, with the aim of finding the optimal serving satellites and resource allocation for downlink communication with users on ground. The results show that, by dedicating an adequate amount of resources for sensing and solving the association and resource allocation problems jointly, it is feasible to increase the average throughput by 59% and the fairness by 600% when compared to solving these problems separately.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.</description>

      <title>Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, scientists are trying to improve the entanglement swapping success rate by researching anti-noise technology on the physical level, thereby obtaining a higher generation rate of long-distance entanglement. However, we may improve the generation rate from another perspective, which is studying an efficient entanglement swapping strategy. This paper analyzes the challenges faced by existing entanglement swapping strategies, including the node allocation principle, time synchronization, and processing of entanglement swapping failure. We present Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping (PSES) to solve these problems. The core idea of PSES is to segment the path and perform parallel entanglement swapping between segments to improve the generation rate of long-distance entanglement. We construct a tree-like model as the carrier of PSES and propose heuristic algorithms called Layer Greedy and Segment Greedy to transform the path into a tree-like model. Moreover, we realize the time synchronization and design the on-demand retransmission mechanism to process entanglement swapping failure. The experiments show that PSES performs superiorly to other entanglement swapping strategies, and the on-demand retransmission mechanism can reduce the average entanglement swapping time by 80% and the average entanglement consumption by 80%.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes current research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to highlight the reasons for the dissent in echo chamber research on the existence, antecedents, and effects of the phenomenon. The review of 112 studies reveals that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is based on different conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. While studies that have conceptualized echo chambers with homophily and utilized data-driven computational social science (CSS) methods have confirmed the echo chamber hypothesis and polarization effects in social media, content exposure studies and surveys that have explored the full spectrum of media exposure have rejected it.
  Most of these studies have been conducted in the United States, and the review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how echo chambers work in systems with more than two parties and outside the Global North. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, future research should prioritize conducting more cross-platform studies, considering algorithmic filtering changes through continuous auditing, and examining the causal direction of the association between polarization, fragmentation, and the establishment of online echo chambers. The review also provides the advantages and disadvantages of different operationalizations and makes recommendations for studies in the European Union (EU), which will become possible with the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA). Overall, this systematic review contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Semantic Communication: Architecture, Challenges, and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to be a core paradigm in future communication networks, yielding significant benefits in terms of spectrum resource saving and information interaction efficiency. However, the existing SemCom structure is limited by the lack of context-reasoning ability and background knowledge provisioning, which, therefore, motivates us to seek the potential of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies with SemCom. Recognizing GAI's powerful capability in automating and creating valuable, diverse, and personalized multimodal content, this article first highlights the principal characteristics of the combination of GAI and SemCom along with their pertinent benefits and challenges. To tackle these challenges, we further propose a novel GAI-integrated SemCom network (GAI-SCN) framework in a cloud-edge-mobile design. Specifically, by employing global and local GAI models, our GAI-SCN enables multimodal semantic content provisioning, semantic-level joint-source-channel coding, and AIGC acquisition to maximize the efficiency and reliability of semantic reasoning and resource utilization. Afterward, we present a detailed implementation workflow of GAI-SCN, followed by corresponding initial simulations for performance evaluation in comparison with two benchmarks. Finally, we discuss several open issues and offer feasible solutions to unlock the full potential of GAI-SCN.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Physical Layer: Review on Data Driven End-to-End Communication Systems and their Enabling Semantic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized wireless communication systems by introducing datadriven end-to-end (E2E) learning, where the physical layer (PHY) is transformed into DL architectures to achieve peak optimization. Leveraging DL for E2E optimization in PHY significantly enhances its adaptability and performance in complex wireless environments, meeting the demands of advanced network systems such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, this evolution of data-driven PHY optimization has also enabled advanced semantic applications across various modalities, including text, image, audio, video, and multimodal transmissions. These applications elevate communication from bit-level to semantic-level intelligence, making it capable of discerning context and intent. Although the PHY, as a DL architecture, plays a crucial role in enabling semantic communication (SemCom) systems, comprehensive studies that integrate both E2E communication and SemCom systems remain significantly underexplored. This highlights the novelty and potential of these integrative fields, marking them as a promising research domain. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive review of the emerging field of data-driven PHY for E2E communication systems, emphasizing their role in enabling semantic applications across various modalities. It also identifies key challenges and potential research directions, serving as a crucial guide for future advancements in DL for E2E communication and SemCom systems.</description>

      <title>ChatTracer: Large Language Model Powered Real-time Bluetooth Device Tracking System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we interact with cyber technologies. In this paper, we study the possibility of connecting LLM with wireless sensor networks (WSN). A successful design will not only extend LLM's knowledge landscape to the physical world but also revolutionize human interaction with WSN. To the end, we present ChatTracer, an LLM-powered real-time Bluetooth device tracking system. ChatTracer comprises three key components: an array of Bluetooth sniffing nodes, a database, and a fine-tuned LLM. ChatTracer was designed based on our experimental observation that commercial Apple/Android devices always broadcast hundreds of BLE packets per minute even in their idle status. Its novelties lie in two aspects: i) a reliable and efficient BLE packet grouping algorithm; and ii) an LLM fine-tuning strategy that combines both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We have built a prototype of ChatTracer with four sniffing nodes. Experimental results show that ChatTracer not only outperforms existing localization approaches, but also provides an intelligent interface for user interaction.</description>

      <title>SQUID: Faster Analytics via Sampled Quantile Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Streaming algorithms are fundamental in the analysis of large and online datasets. A key component of many such analytic tasks is $q$-MAX, which finds the largest $q$ values in a number stream. Modern approaches attain a constant runtime by removing small items in bulk and retaining the largest $q$ items at all times. Yet, these approaches are bottlenecked by an expensive quantile calculation.
  This work introduces a quantile-sampling approach called SQUID and shows its benefits in multiple analytic tasks. Using this approach, we design a novel weighted heavy hitters data structure that is faster and more accurate than the existing alternatives. We also show SQUID's practicality for improving network-assisted caching systems with a hardware-based cache prototype that uses SQUID to implement the cache policy. The challenge here is that the switch's dataplane does not allow the general computation required to implement many cache policies, while its CPU is orders of magnitude slower. We overcome this issue by passing just SQUID's samples to the CPU, thus bridging this gap.
  In software implementations, we show that our method is up to 6.6x faster than the state-of-the-art alternatives when using real workloads. For switch-based caching, SQUID enables a wide spectrum of data-plane-based caching policies and achieves higher hit ratios than the state-of-the-art P4LRU.</description>

      <title>A Deep RL Approach on Task Placement and Scaling of Edge Resources for Cellular Vehicle-to-Network Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is currently at the forefront of the digital transformation of our society. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with the traffic environment using cellular networks, we redefine transportation, improving road safety and transportation services, increasing efficiency of vehicular traffic flows, and reducing environmental impact. To effectively facilitate the provisioning of Cellular Vehicular-to-Network (C-V2N) services, we tackle the interdependent problems of service task placement and scaling of edge resources. Specifically, we formulate the joint problem and prove that it is not computationally tractable. To address its complexity we introduce a Deep Hybrid Policy Gradient (DHPG), a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for hybrid action spaces.The performance of DHPG is evaluated against several state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions through simulations employing a real-world C-V2N traffic dataset. The results demonstrate that DHPG outperforms SoA solutions in maintaining C-V2N service latency below the preset delay threshold, while simultaneously optimizing the utilization of computing resources. Finally, time complexity analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed approach can support real-time C-V2N services.</description>

Abstract: The research of architecture has tremendous significance in realizing quantum Internet. Although there is not yet a standard quantum Internet architecture, the distributed architecture is one of the possible solutions, which utilizes quantum repeaters or dedicated entanglement sources in a flat structure for entanglement preparation &amp; distribution. In this paper, we analyze the distributed architecture in detail and demonstrate that it has three limitations: 1) possible high maintenance overhead, 2) possible low-performance entanglement distribution, and 3) unable to support optimal entanglement routing. We design a hierarchical quantum Internet architecture and a communication model to solve the problems above. We also present a W-state Based Centralized Entanglement Preparation &amp; Distribution (W-state Based CEPD) scheme and a Centralized Entanglement Routing (CER) algorithm within our hierarchical architecture and perform an experimental comparison with other entanglement preparation &amp; distribution schemes and entanglement routing algorithms within the distributed architecture. The evaluation results show that the entanglement distribution efficiency of hierarchical architecture is 11.5% higher than that of distributed architecture on average (minimum 3.3%, maximum 37.3%), and the entanglement routing performance of hierarchical architecture is much better than that of a distributed architecture according to the fidelity and throughput.</description>
