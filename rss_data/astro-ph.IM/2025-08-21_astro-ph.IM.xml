      <title>Optimized scintillation configuration for IMPISH hard x-ray detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a solar X-ray spectrometer that features large-area scintillators, fast readout electronics, and good energy resolution in the hard X-ray band. IMPISH is a low-cost spectrometer designed to measure subsecond variation in hard X-ray time profiles from solar flares, with the goal of constraining particle acceleration timescales. To meet these requirements, we carried out a systematic optimization of the scintillation design, focusing on maximizing photon collection, reducing noise level, and improving energy resolution. We tested two high-yield scintillating crystals (LYSO, lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate, and GAGG, gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet), two reflector types (specular and lambertian), two kinds of surface finishes (all sides polished and readout face only polished), different optical coupling materials and thicknesses, multiple geometries, and readout face angles. Our studies show that light collection improves with increasing the crystal's effective area, breaking its symmetry, and reducing the photon's travel length. These minimize photon loss due to self-absorption and total internal reflection. Through combined simulation and laboratory tests, we achieved an optimal energy resolution with the LYSO trapezoid-shaped crystal coupled to a Broadcom NUV-MT SiPM with an approximately 0.25 mm thin Sylgard 184 optical pad.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{HostSub_GP}$: Precise Galaxy Background Subtraction in Transient Spectroscopy with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel host galaxy subtraction technique in longslit spectroscopy for extragalactic transients. Unlike classic methods which generally estimate the background using a simple linear interpolation of local galaxy flux in the 2D spectrum, our approach leverages multi-band archival images of the host galaxies to model the background emission from the galaxy in the 2D spectrum. Such imaging is readily accessible through wide-field imaging surveys. These images encode the wavelength-dependent galaxy profile along the slit. We construct a smooth prior for the 2D galaxy profile with a Gaussian process (GP) based on these reference images, and use another GP to model the correlated deviations from the prior in the observed spectrum. This enables accurate inference of the galaxy flux blended with the transient. On synthetic longslit data of a spiral galaxy extracted from a Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) hyper-spectral cube, the GP method remains robust as long as the host galaxy is spatially resolved and consistently outperforms the classic method. We apply the method to archival Keck spectra of two real transients, SN 2019eix and AT 2019qiz, to further demonstrate how the method uniquely recovers weak spectral features amid strong galaxy contamination, enabling refined constraints on the properties of both transients. We have released the software implementation, $\texttt{HostSub_GP}$, a scalable toolkit that leverages $\texttt{JAX}$, with an MIT license.</description>

      <title>Detecting Extraterrestrial Civilizations That Employ an Earth-level Deep Space Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major aspect of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) involves searching for electromagnetic transmissions from extraterrestrial sources, often using our own transmissions as a guide. Previous studies have suggested that humanity's most consistently detectable technosignatures were transmissions from our deep-space networks and interplanetary radar. In this study, we analyze NASA Deep Space Network logs to explore what strategies for selecting SETI targets and scheduling observations would enhance the chances of detecting such networks. Analyzing Deep Space Network uplink transmission logs over the last 20 yr, we find that these emissions were predominantly directed along the ecliptic plane, towards or directly away from the Sun, and towards other planets. The average duty cycle within the Earth Transit Zone is 20 times higher than that across all ecliptic latitudes. In the case of Mars, we find a species that is able to observe the Solar System for radio emission during an Earth-Mars conjunction in the past 20 yr would have had a 77% chance of observing during one of our transmissions, a $4\times10^5$-fold increase over intercepting our Deep Space Network transmission versus a random observer at a random time. These findings quantify how SETI searches might benefit from prioritizing edge-on exoplanet systems and aligning observation windows with exoplanetary conjunctions or planet-planet occultations because they significantly improve the likelihood of intercepting transmissions from any civilizations employing deep-space networks similar to our own.</description>

      <title>Adding colour to the Zernike wavefront sensor: Advantages of including multi-wavelength measurements for wavefront reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To directly image Earth-like planets, contrast levels of 10^-8 - 10^-10 are required. The next generation of instruments will need wavefront control below the nanometer level to achieve these goals. The Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) is a promising candidate thanks to its sensitivity, which reaches the fundamental quantum information limits. However, its highly non-linear response restricts its practical use case. We aim to demonstrate the improvement in robustness of the ZWFS by reconstructing the wavefront based on multi-wavelength measurements facilitated by technologies such as the microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). We performed numerical simulations using an accelerated multi-wavelength gradient descent reconstruction algorithm. Three aspects are considered: dynamic range, photon noise sensitivity, and phase unwrapping. We examined both the scalar and vector ZWFS. Firstly, we find that using multiple wavelengths improves the dynamic range of the scalar ZWFS. However, for the vector ZWFS, its already extended range was not further increased. In addition, a multi-wavelength reconstruction allowed us to take advantage of a broader bandpass, which increases the number of available photons, making the reconstruction more robust to photon noise. Finally, multi-wavelength phase unwrapping enabled the measurement of large discontinuities such as petal errors with a trade-off in noise performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Data Interpretation for Perturbed Nulling Interferometers via Proper Handling of Correlated Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable, temperate terrestrial exoplanets using a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer is a major goal of contemporary astrophysics. A central part of the analysis of such an instrument are correlated errors arising from perturbations in the system. While previous studies have often treated their effects in a limited manner, we aim to treat them comprehensively here and argue that data whitening based on the covariance of these errors is a suitable method to mitigate their impact. We present a framework that quantitatively connects instrumental perturbations to performance metrics and develop two computational tools to support our analysis: PHRINGE, for the generation of synthetic nulling data, and LIFEsimMC, a new Monte Carlo-based end-to-end simulator for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). Applying our framework to a reference observation of an Earth twin orbiting a Sun twin at 10 pc, we find that whitening is not only essential for a correct interpretation of the detection metric used in hypothesis testing, but also improves the estimates of the planetary properties. Moreover, our approach enables an estimation of the spectral covariance of the extracted planetary spectra, providing valuable additional input for future atmospheric retrievals. We therefore recommend incorporating the framework into performance assessments and requirement derivations for future nulling interferometers.</description>

      <title>Condensation Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres with Virga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present an open-source cloud model for substellar atmospheres, called Virga. The Virga-v0 series has already been widely adopted in the literature. It is written in Python and has heritage from the Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001) model (often referred to as eddysed), used to study clouds on both exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In the development of the official Virga-v1 we have retained all the original functionality of eddysed and updated/expanded several components including the back-end optical constants data, calculations of the Mie properties, available condensate species, saturation vapor pressure curves and formalism for fall speeds calculations. Here we benchmark Virga by reproducing key results in the literature, including the SiO2 cloud detection in WASP-17 b and the brown dwarf Diamondback-Sonora model series. Development of Virga is ongoing, with future versions already planned and ready for release. We encourage community feedback and collaborations within the GitHub code repository.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Hazardous Near-Earth Object Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Resampling Strategies and Machine Learning Algorithms in Planetary Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation. Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and 0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.</description>

      <title>Single Epoch Measurements of Dispersion Measure Gradients Towards PSR B0834+06</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of pulsar dispersion measures is vital to high precision timing experiments, as well as astrometric experiments to determine pulsar positions and proper motions. In this work, we present a novel approach to measuring dispersion measure gradients using pulsar scintillometry. This approach makes use of the multipath propagation through the interstellar medium to simultaneously probe dispersion measures along multiple sight lines from a single observation. Using existing data of PSR B0834+06, we are able to measure gradients of $9.7\pm0.3\times10^{-6}~\rm{pc}~\rm{cm}^{-3}~\rm{mas}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Investigation of B-fields in Cores and Filaments Using JCMT/SCUPOL Legacy Survey Archival Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.</description>

      <title>3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1): Direct Spacecraft Exploration of a Possible Relic of Planetary Formation at "Cosmic Noon"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), henceforth, 3I), discovered by the ATLAS Chile telescope on 2025 July 1, was rapidly revealed to be the third known interstellar object (ISO) transiting the solar system, with an incoming velocity at infinity of 57.9763 $\pm$ 0.0044 km s$^{-1}$. An examination of 3I's pre-encounter kinematics shows that it is likely to be an object from the galactic thick disk, and thus a remnant of the Galaxy's ``cosmic noon'' period of intense star formation $\sim$9 - 13 gigayears ago. This kinematic assignment of 3I to the thick disk can be tested observationally in the transit of 3I through the solar system. Unfortunately for terrestrial observers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the Sun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering observation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible. With a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the ecliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will pass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary spacecraft. We find a strong science case for observations in the periods of the close approaches of the Psyche spacecraft on 2025 September 4, at 0.302 AU, the martian spacecraft array on 2025 October 3, and the Juice spacecraft on 2025 November 4. In addition, the Europa Clipper, Hera and even the more distant Lucy spacecraft may pass through 3I's cometary tail in the period after its perihelion passage, potentially directly observing the conditions and composition there. Spacecraft observations could, to the extent they are possible, provide the only source of spectral and imaging data during the 3I perihelion passage.</description>

      <title>On Soft Clustering For Correlation Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properly estimating correlations between objects at different spatial scales necessitates $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ distance calculations. For this reason, most widely adopted packages for estimating correlations use clustering algorithms to approximate local trends. However, methods for quantifying the error introduced by this clustering have been understudied. In response, we present an algorithm for estimating correlations that is probabilistic in the way that it clusters objects, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty caused by clustering simply through model inference. These soft clustering assignments enable correlation estimators that are theoretically differentiable with respect to their input catalogs. Thus, we also build a theoretical framework for differentiable correlation functions and describe their utility in comparison to existing surrogate models. Notably, we find that repeated normalization and distance function calls slow gradient calculations and that sparse Jacobians destabilize precision, pointing towards either approximate or surrogate methods as a necessary solution to exact gradients from correlation functions. To that end, we close with a discussion of surrogate models as proxies for correlation functions. We provide an example that demonstrates the efficacy of surrogate models to enable gradient-based optimization of astrophysical model parameters, successfully minimizing a correlation function output. Our numerical experiments cover science cases across cosmology, from point spread function (PSF) modeling efforts to gravitational simulations to galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA).</description>

      <title>Implementing Errors on Errors: Bayesian vs Frequentist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When combining apparently inconsistent experimental results, one often implements errors on errors. The Particle Data Group's phenomenological prescription offers a practical solution but lacks a firm theoretical foundation. To address this, D'Agostini and Cowan have proposed Bayesian and frequentist approaches, respectively, both introducing gamma-distributed auxiliary variables to model uncertainty in quoted errors. In this Letter, we show that these two formulations admit a parameter-by-parameter correspondence, and are structurally equivalent. This identification clarifies how Bayesian prior choices can be interpreted in terms of frequentist sampling assumptions, providing a unified probabilistic framework for modeling uncertainty in quoted variances.</description>

      <title>Influence of Density Distribution on Synchrotron Polarization Dispersion in Magnetized Interstellar Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faraday rotation measure (RM) synthesis is a well-known approach originated in Burn (1966) and later developed by Brentjens \&amp; de Bruyn (2005) for studying magnetic fields. This work presents a complementary approach--the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)--allowing for the properties of the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult to include in Burn's original approach. Based on synthetic polarization observation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulation data, we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the RM in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since it avoids the influence of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles</title>

Abstract: Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.</description>

      <title>Surya: Foundation Model for Heliophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning. Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar evolution.</description>
