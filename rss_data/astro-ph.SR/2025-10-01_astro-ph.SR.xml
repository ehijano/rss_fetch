      <title>[C/N] Ages for Red Giants and their Implications for Galactic Archaeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red giants undergo the first dredge-up, a mixing event that creates a connection between their surface [C/N] and their mass and age. We derive a [C/N]-Age relationship for red giants calibrated on APOGEE DR17 abundances and APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages. We find that we can use [C/N] to reliably recover asteroseismic ages between 1 and 10 Gyr with average uncertainties of 1.64 Gyr. We find that [C/N] yields concordant ages, with modest offsets, for stars in different evolutionary states. We also find that the [C/N]-birth mass relationship is robust for luminous giants, and argue that this is an advantage over direct asteroseismology for these stars. We use our ages to infer Galactic birth abundance trends in [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as a function of position in the Galactic disk. We filter out stars with kinematic or chemical properties consistent with migrators and found the number of migrators to be much lower than expected by standard radial migration prescriptions. The remaining population shows weak chemical evolution trends, on the order of 0.01 dex/Gyr, over the last 10 Gyr across a wide range of radii.</description>

      <title>Coronal mass ejection arrival forecasting with the drag-based assimilation of satellite observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting the arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is vital for protecting satellites, power systems, and human spaceflight. We present HELIOPANDA: Heliospheric Observer for Predicting CME Arrival via Nonlinear Drag Assimilation, a framework that integrates the Drag-Based Model (DBM) with spacecraft observations using iterative parameter estimation and Kalman filter assimilation. We introduce a method for estimating the solar wind speed $w$ and drag parameter $\gamma$, two key but usually unknown quantities controlling CME propagation, through direct solutions of the DBM equations. We tested the method on 4,480 synthetic CME profiles spanning CME speeds of $200-3500$ km/s, solar wind speeds of $250-800$ km/s, and drag parameters of $0.1-1.0\times10^{-7}$ km$^{-1}$. The results demonstrate that the framework provides accurate reconstructions of the DBM input parameters, providing a solid basis for in-situ and remote-sensing applications. By testing a single virtual spacecraft positioned at nine distances along the Sun-Earth line, HELIOPANDA achieved arrival-time errors as low as 0.6 hours for a 600 km/s CME and 1 hour for a 2500 km/s CME when the spacecraft was located 30 million km from the Sun. We developed a Kalman filter framework to assimilate noisy heliospheric data into the DBM, enabling recursive updates of CME kinematics and robust estimates of $w$ and $\gamma$, and yielding Earth and Mars arrival-time predictions within $1-2$ hours using 160 simulated hourly measurements. By combining DBM, parameter recovery, and data assimilation, HELIOPANDA provides a pathway to real-time, multi-point CME forecasts, suited to observations from Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, PUNCH, and planned L4/L5 missions.</description>

      <title>Test particle sampling and particle acceleration in a 2D coronal plasmoid-mediated reconnecting current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Solar flares accelerate electrons, creating non-thermal energy distributions. However, the acceleration sites and dominant acceleration mechanisms remain largely unknown.
  Aims: We study the characteristics of electron acceleration and subsequent non-thermal energy distribution in a 2D coronal plasmoid-mediated reconnecting current sheet.
  Methods: We used test particles and the guiding centre approximation to transport electrons in a static coronal 2D fan-spine topology magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) snapshot. The snapshot was from a Bifrost simulation that featured plasmoid-mediated reconnection at a current sheet. To sample initial particle conditions that lead to non-thermal energies, we used importance sampling. In this way, the characteristics of the non-thermal electrons were statistically representative of the MHD plasma.
  Results: The energy distribution of the electrons forms a non-thermal power law that varies with our tolerance of the guiding centre approximation's validity, from no obvious power law to a power law with an exponent of -4 (the power law also depends on the statistical weighing of the electrons). The non-thermal electrons gain energy through a gradual betatron acceleration close to magnetic null points associated with plasmoids.
  Conclusions: In this static, asymmetric, coronal, 2D fan-spine topology MHD configuration, non-thermal electron acceleration occurs only in the vicinity of null points associated with magnetic gradients and electric fields induced by plasmoid formation and ejection. However, the guiding centre approximation alone is not sufficient to properly estimate the shape of the non-thermal power law since, according to our results, electron acceleration is correlated with the adiabaticity of the particles' motion. The results also show that the particle power law formation is biased by the test particle sampling procedure.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic simulations of FIP fractionation in solar flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental abundances in solar flares are observed to vary both spatially and temporally, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. There is an interplay between advection and the preferential acceleration of low first ionization potential (FIP) elements that likely shapes the observed abundance distributions. Models of the FIP effect predict enhancements near loop footpoints that diffuse upward over time. We simulate strong evaporation events that advect this low-FIP enhancement into the corona. When the enhancement is sharply peaked, the corona does not become fractionated, exhibiting only a localized abundance peak near the loop apex that facilitates coronal rain formation. In contrast, a broad enhancement with relatively weak heating yields a uniformly fractionated corona, which is not sufficient for coronal rain formation. As the heating rate increases, the low-FIP material is increasingly compressed toward the loop apex, and rain is able to form. These results suggest a potential observational correlation between the presence and amount of coronal rain, the strength of flare heating, and the fractionation process itself.</description>

      <title>The Hourglass-shaped Magnetic Fields and Dust Filaments in the HH 211 Protostellar Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields influence the structure and evolution of protostellar systems, thus understanding their role is essential for probing the earliest stages of star formation. We present ALMA Band 3 and 6 polarized continuum observations at $\sim$0.5$^{\prime \prime}$ resolution toward the Class 0 protostellar system HH 211. Three dust filaments ($\sim$4000 au in length) are found in the HH 211 protostellar envelope, two of which are aligned with core-scale ($\sim$10,000 au) magnetic fields detected by previous JCMT observations. This result suggests that the formation of the dust filaments may be influenced by magnetic fields. In the inner envelope ($\sim$1000 au), we detect a clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology near the protostar and toroidal fields along the outflow directions. We also estimate the line-of-sight-averaged temperature and column density distributions in the inner envelope and find that the temperature is higher in the east, while the column density is enhanced in the southern and western regions. The southern dense regions of the inner envelope may trace either outflow cavity walls, due to their alignment with the outflow, or possible infalling channels in the midplane, given the close correspondence between the observed magnetic fields and the predicted infall trajectories.</description>

      <title>\`A Propos Strange Pulsations of Blue Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of radial nonlinear pulsations of massive blue stars are computed with the MESA software instrument in its dynamical mode. Pulsational instabilities could be computationally detected and followed if the evolutionary timestep was reduced to a fraction of the unfolding pulsation period. Stellar variability was recovered in regions on the HR plane that have been studied before and that are known to host LBVs and relatives. Mode properties are analyzed on the full stellar-evolution models, which are not in thermal equilibrium. Despite persistent numerical shortcomings, it appears possible to compute strange-mode - like pulsations of massive blue stars with MESA.</description>

      <title>The twin red giant branch system BD+20 5391 A case study of low-mass double-core evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interactions of binary systems on the red giant branch is crucial to understanding the formation of compact stellar remnants such as helium-core white dwarfs (He-WDs) and hot subdwarfs. However, the detailed evolution of such systems, particularly those with nearly identical components, remains under-explored. We aim to analyse the double-lined spectroscopic binary system BD+20 5391, composed of two red giant stars, in order to characterise its orbital and stellar parameters and to constrain its evolution. Spectroscopic data were collected between 2020 and 2025 using the Ond\v{r}ejov Echelle Spectrograph and the Mercator \'Echelle Spectrograph. The time-resolved spectra were fitted with models to determine the radial velocity curve and derive the system's parameters. We then used the position of both stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to constrain the system's current evolutionary state, and we discuss potential outcomes of future interactions between the binary components. We find that the two stars in BD+20 5391 will likely initiate Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) simultaneously, leading to a double-core evolution scenario. The stars' helium core masses at RLOF onset will be almost identical, at 0.33 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This synchronised evolution suggests two possible outcomes: common envelope ejection, resulting in a short-period double He-WD binary, or a merger without envelope ejection. In the former case, the resulting double He-WD may merge later and form a hot subdwarf star. This study provides a valuable benchmark example for understanding the evolution of interacting red giant binaries, which will be discovered in substantial numbers in upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>An excess of luminous white dwarfs in the peculiar Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\approx$ 60 - 70\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\approx$ 30 - 40\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC~2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength View of $\rho$ Oph I: Resolving the X-ray Source Between A and B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of the central stellar pair of $\rho$ Oph, components A and B. Using recent high-resolution \textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory} observations, we demonstrate with high confidence that the dominant X-ray source is $\rho$ Oph B, while $\rho$ Oph A is comparatively X-ray faint. This result contrasts with earlier \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which, due to limited spatial resolutions, attributed the X-ray emission to $\rho$ Oph A. An analysis of $\rho$ Oph B's X-ray light curves and spectra reveals properties more consistent with a cool star than a hot star. We therefore propose that $\rho$ Oph B is an Algol-like binary system, consisting of a B-type primary and an active, X-ray-emitting GK-type companion.</description>

      <title>Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer on board Aditya-L1: Ground Calibration and In-flight Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Low-Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS) on board India's Aditya-L1 mission was launched on 2 September 2023 and commenced solar observations on 13 December 2023 following successful aperture cover deployment. Operating from the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, SoLEXS has been providing continuous Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray spectroscopy across 2-22 keV with 170 eV resolution at 5.9 keV and 1-second temporal cadence since 6 January 2024. The instrument employs two Silicon Drift Detectors with aperture areas of 7.1 mm$^2$ and 0.1 mm$^2$ to accommodate the full dynamic range of solar activity from A-class to X-class flares. This paper presents comprehensive ground and on board calibration procedures that establish SoLEXS's quantitative spectroscopic capabilities. Ground calibration encompassed energy-channel relationships, spectral resolution characterization, instrument response functions, and collimator angular response measurements, with thermo-vacuum testing validating performance stability across operational temperature ranges. On board calibration utilizing an internal $^{55}$Fe source demonstrated preserved post-launch spectral resolution (164.9-171.2 eV), while cross-calibration with GOES-XRS and Chandrayaan-2/XSM confirmed radiometric accuracy and flux agreement. The instrument's 100% observational duty cycle at L1 enables unprecedented continuous monitoring of solar flare evolution across all intensity classes, providing calibrated data for advancing coronal heating mechanisms, flare energetics, and flare-coronal mass ejection relationship studies through soft X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Impact of near-degeneracy effects on linear rotational inversions for red-giant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of internal red-giant rotation rates are a crucial ingredient for constraining and improving current models of stellar rotation. Asteroseismic rotational inversions are a method to estimate these internal rotation rates. In this work, we focus on the observed differences in the rotationally-induced frequency shifts between prograde and retrograde modes, which were ignored in previous works when estimating internal rotation rates of red giants using inversions. We systematically study the limits of applicability of linear rotational inversions as a function of the evolution on the red-giant branch and the underlying rotation rates. We solve for the oscillation mode frequencies in the presence of rotation in the lowest-order perturbative approach. This enables a description of the differences between prograde and retrograde modes through the coupling of multiple mixed modes. We compute synthetic rotational splittings taking these near-degeneracy effects into account. We use red-giant models with one solar mass, a large frequency separation between 16 and 9 microhertz and core rotation rates between 500 and 1500 nHz covering the regime of observed parameters of Kepler red-giant stars. Finally, we use these synthetic data to quantify the systematic errors of internal rotation rates estimated by means of rotational inversions in the presence of near-degeneracy effects. We show that the systematic errors in the estimated rotation rates introduced by near-degeneracy effects surpass observational uncertainties for more evolved and faster rotating stars. The estimated rotation rates of some of the previously analysed red giants suffer from significant systematic errors that have not been taken into account yet. Notwithstanding, reliable analyses with existing inversion methods are feasible for a number of red giants within the parameter ranges determined here.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Cold Worlds: Predicted Near- to Mid-infrared Spectral Signatures of a Cold Brown Dwarf with Potential Auroral Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have revealed strong methane emission at 3.326 microns in the $\approx$482 K brown dwarf CWISEP J193518.59$-$154620.3 (W1935). Atmospheric modeling suggests the presence of a $\approx$300 K thermal inversion in its upper atmosphere, potentially driven by auroral activity. We present an extension of the retrieved spectra of W1935 with and without inversion spanning 1--20 microns, to identify thermal inversion-sensitive spectral features and explore the origin of the object's peculiar characteristics. Our analysis indicates that atmospheric heating contributes approximately 15% to the bolometric luminosity. The model with inversion predicts an additional similar-strength methane emission feature at 7.7 microns and tentative ammonia emission features in the mid-infrared. Wavelengths beyond $\sim$2 microns are significantly influenced by the inversion, except for the 4.1--5.0 microns CO$_2$ and CO features that originate from atmospheric layers deeper than the region where the inversion occurs. W1935 appears as an outlier in Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on the $m_{\rm Ch1}-m_{\rm Ch2}$ (IRAC 3.6 microns $-$ 4.5 microns) color, but exhibits average behavior in all other combinations that trace clear sequences. This anomaly is likely due to the Ch2 filter probing vertical mixing-sensitive CO$_2$ and CO features that do not correlate with temperature or spectral type. We find that the thermal inversion tends to produce bluer $m_{\rm Ch1}-m_{\rm Ch2}$ colors, so the overluminous and/or redder position of W1935 in diagrams involving this color cannot be explained by the thermal inversion. This analysis provides insights into the intriguing dispersion of cold brown dwarfs in mid-infrared CMDs and sheds light on their spectral diversity.</description>

      <title>Double Power-law Electron Spectra in Solar Flares Due to Temperature Anisotropy Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive observational and theoretical efforts, the physical processes responsible for shaping the diversity of accelerated electron spectra observed in solar flares remain poorly understood. We use 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetized plasmas subject to continuous shear-driven magnetic amplification to investigate whether electron temperature anisotropy instabilities in above-the-loop-top (ALT) regions can account for this diversity. We explore how the resulting spectra depend on key plasma parameters: the initial electron temperature $T_e$ and the initial ratio of electron cyclotron to plasma frequencies, $f_e = \omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$. In our simulations, the adiabatic evolution of the plasma generates electron temperature anisotropy with the electron temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field being larger than the parallel temperature. This eventually drives electromagnetic instabilities capable of scattering and accelerating electrons. The simulations consistently produce nonthermal tails in the electron spectra whose hardness increases with the initial value of $f_e$, while depending only weakly on $T_e$. For runs in which $f_e \lesssim 1.2$, the spectra exhibit double power-law shapes with downward (knee-like) breaks, and the electron scattering is dominated by OQES modes. In runs with $f_e\gtrsim 1.5$, PEMZ modes dominate and produce harder double power-law spectra with upward (elbow-like) breaks. Cases that include the $f_e\sim 1.2-1.5$ transition yield nearly single power-laws that end with bump-like breaks. Our results support the role of temperature anisotropy instabilities in accelerating electrons in ALT regions, offering a promising framework to help explain the wide range of nonthermal electron spectra reported in solar flare observations.</description>

      <title>Supergranulation and poleward migration of the magnetic field at high latitudes of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40\,Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20\,m\,s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>$\phi$-Dwarfs: White Dwarfs probe Quadratically Coupled Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ultralight scalar fields with quadratic couplings to Standard-Model fermions and derive strong constraints from white-dwarf mass-radius data. Such couplings source scalar profiles inside compact stars, shift fermion masses, and can produce a new ground state of matter. We analyze couplings to electrons and to nucleons, incorporating composition and finite-temperature effects in white dwarf structure and equations of state. We identify two robust observables: (i) forbidden gaps - ranges of radii with no stable configurations - and (ii) characteristic shape distortions that drive white dwarf masses toward the Chandrasekhar limit (electron couplings) or shift the maximum mass (nucleon couplings). Confronting these predictions with precise measurements for Sirius B and Procyon B, together with the global white dwarf population, excludes large regions of unexplored parameter space and extends earlier QCD-axion-specific bounds to a broader class of scalar theories. Our stellar constraints rely only on sourcing and do not assume the scalar constitutes dark matter; where mass reductions are small, precision laboratory searches remain competitive. White-dwarf astrophysics thus provides a powerful, largely assumption-minimal probe of ultralight, quadratically coupled scalars.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project: II. Circumnebular extinction variations and their effect on the planetary nebulae luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). While the brightest younger PN populations are expected to be brighter in their [OIII] emission than observed, recent studies have proposed circumnebular extinction to be a key ingredient for bringing their brightness down to the observed bright end. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Architectures of S-type Transiting Planets in Binaries II: A Dichotomy in Orbital Alignment of Small Planets in Close Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\prime\prime}$ to $2^{\prime\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p&lt;5R_{\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\log Z\gtrsim13.9$, or $\approx$5$\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\sigma_1 = 2^{\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\sigma_2 = 23^{\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $&gt;40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $&lt;40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.</description>

      <title>Assessing Self-Absorbed Molecular Lines as Tracers of Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Redshifted self-absorption features in molecular lines are commonly interpreted as signatures of gravitational collapse in pre- and protostellar cores. The shape of the line profile then encodes information on the dynamics of the collapse. There exist well-established observational techniques to estimate infall velocities from these profiles, but these have historically been calibrated on constant-velocity slab models, whereas more realistic simulations of gravitational collapse produce highly non-uniform radial velocity profiles. We produce synthetic line observations of a simulated collapsing prestellar core, including a treatment of the time-dependent chemical evolution. Applying observational techniques to the synthetic line profiles, we find that the estimated infall velocities are significantly and systematically lower than the mass-weighted infall velocities from the simulation. This is primarily because the self-absorption features tend to originate from the outer regions of the core, well beyond the location of the peak infall velocity. Velocities and mass accretion rates measured via these techniques are likely to underestimate the true values.</description>

      <title>Analytic Interferometry of Rotating Stellar Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surfaces of rotating stars serve as a window into their interiors, magnetic dynamos, and are important in other areas including exoplanet discovery and atmospheric characterization. While indirect techniques such as photometry and Doppler imaging have been studied for their ability to map stellar surfaces, the gold standard remains optical long-baseline interferometry. In this paper, we develop new closed-form solutions for the interferometric visibility of a rotating star with an arbitrary inhomogeneous surface. We introduce the concept of 'stellar rotation synthesis' in interferometry--an analog of Earth rotation synthesis--where stellar rotation adds information to the spherical harmonic modes representing the star's surface intensity. We implement these solutions in the open-source package harmonix, written in JAX with automatic differentiation, providing a rich ecosystem for fitting and inference. Inspired by similar studies for photometry and Doppler imaging, we use simulations of a fiducial star as observed by the CHARA Array and intensity interferometers to perform a comprehensive theoretical study of the information theory of the starspot mapping problem in interferometry. We show that adding simultaneous photometry from a space-based instrument such as TESS adds complementary spatial information to interferometry and can improve the precision on the map coefficients by over an order of magnitude, enabling the detailed mapping of nearby main-sequence stars with current facilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing and proposed intensity interferometers for stellar surface mapping.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Atmosphere of HD 149026b: The Role of Stellar Abundances and Choice of Opacities in Exoplanet Atmosphere Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs within the same molecular cloud as the host star, suggesting a link between the elemental abundances of star and the planet. Exoplanet atmosphere studies often assume solar abundances for host stars, however, specific host star abundances might lead to more accurate constraints. In this work, we perform sensitivity studies for a metal rich stellar host HD 149026 and its exoplanet HD 149026b, to understand the effect of solar versus stellar abundance choice on the $P$-$T$ profiles, equilibrium chemical abundances and emission spectra, using self-consistent atmosphere models. We find that the differences are dependent on the model parameters, particularly C/O ratio, and for HD 149026b the difference in the eclipse depth is maximum $\sim$80 ppm, for C/O between 0.75-0.85. Recent JWST NIRCam observations of HD 149026b have yielded widely varying metallicity ranges, highly super-solar (59-275$\times$) using chemical equilibrium retrievals and 12-31$\times$ solar using self-consistent models, both using solar abundances. In this work, we constrain the metallicity of HD 149026b to be 53-113$\times$ solar, with solar abundances and 39-78$\times$ stellar, with stellar abundances. We constrain the self-consistent $P$-$T$ profile of HD 149026b to be substantially cooler (upto 500 K) than the self-consistent best-fit model in the previous work, in the emission spectra probed region, thus requiring higher CO$_2$ abundance to explain the observations, leading to comparatively higher metallicity constraint. We find that the inclusion of Fe opacity in computing self-consistent $P$-$T$ profiles for HD 149026b in our models is the major reason for these differences. We constrain the C/O ratio to 0.47-0.68 and the heat redistribution factor to 0.70-0.76, indicating higher heat redistribution than previously estimated.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Neutron Star Systems through Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</description>

      <title>Investigating four new candidate redback pulsars discovered in the image plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the discovery and follow-up of four candidate redback spider pulsars: GPM J1723-33, GPM J1734-28, GPM J1752-30 and GPM J1815-14, discovered with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from an imaging survey of the Galactic Plane. These sources are considered to be redback candidates based on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential Fermi $\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (&lt;24 hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to understanding the origin of the unexplained $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Investigating the vertical distribution of molecular content in protoplanetary disks remains difficult in most disks mildly inclined along the line of sight. In contrast, edge-on disks provide a direct (tomographic) view of the 2D molecular brightness. Aims: We study the radial and vertical molecular distribution as well as the gas temperature and density by observing the Keplerian edge-on disk surrounding the Flying Saucer, a Class II object located in Ophiuchus. Methods: We use new and archival ALMA data to perform a tomography of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, CN, HCN, CS, H$_2$CO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, N$_2$D$^+$, DCN and $^{13}$CS. We analyze molecular tomographies and model data using the radiative transfer code DiskFit. Results: We directly measure the altitude above the mid-plane for each observed species. For the first time, we unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a common molecular layer and measure its thickness: most molecules are located at the same altitude versus radius. Beyond CO, as predicted by chemical models, the CN emission traces the upper boundary of the molecular layer, whereas the deuterated species (DCN and N2D+) resides below one scale-height. Our best fits from DiskFit show that most observed transitions in the molecular layer are thermalized because their excitation temperature is the same, around 17-20 K. Conclusions: These long-integration observations clearly reveal a molecular layer predominantly located around 1-2 scale height, at a temperature above the CO freeze-out temperature. The deuterated molecules are closer to the mid-plane and N2D+ may be a good proxy for the CO snowline. Some molecules, such as CN and H2CO, are likely influenced by the disk environment, at least beyond the mm dust disk radius. The direct observation of the molecular stratification opens the door to detailed chemical modeling in this disk which appears representative of T Tauri disks.</description>

Abstract: Hypernuclei and hypernuclear matter connect nuclear structure in the strangeness sector with the astrophysics of neutron stars, where hyperons are expected to emerge at high densities and affect key astrophysical observables. We present the first {\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>General Relativity Can Prevent a Runaway Greenhouse on Potentially Habitable Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting in the habitable zones of white dwarfs have recently been proposed as promising targets for biosignature searches. However, since the white dwarf habitable zone resides at 0.01 - 0.1 AU, planets residing there are subject to tidal heating if they have any orbital eccentricity. Previous work (Barnes &amp; Heller 2013) identified nearby planetary companions as potential roadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions could induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable planet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway greenhouse for even very low values ($e \sim 10^{-4}$) of the eccentricity of the potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for general relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse, and demonstrate that for some system architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>A transiting hot Jupiter with two outer siblings orbiting an intermediate-mass post main-sequence star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanetary systems with multiple giant planets present an opportunity to understand planet formation, migration processes, and long-term system-wide dynamical interactions. In particular, they provide constraints to distinguish between smooth disk-driven migration or more dynamically excited system evolution pathways. We report the discovery and characterization of a unique multi-planet system hosting three gas giant planets orbiting the post-main sequence star TOI-375. The innermost planet, TOI-375 b, was initially detected by the TESS mission and then confirmed with photometric follow-up observations conducted using MEarth and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements obtained with FEROS and CHIRON. The radial velocity data revealed the presence of two additional planetary candidates, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d. We find that TOI-375 b is a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of $9.45469 \pm 0.00002$ days, mass $0.745 \pm 0.053,M_\mathrm{J}$, radius $0.961 \pm 0.043, R_\mathrm{J}$, and eccentricity $0.087 \pm 0.042$. The outer two planets, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d, are warm-cold and cold Jupiters with orbital periods of $115.5^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ days and $297.9^{+28.9}_{-18.6}$ days, and minimum masses of $2.11 \pm 0.22, M_\mathrm{J}$ and $1.40 \pm 0.28, M_\mathrm{J}$, respectively. In terms of formation and overall system architecture, the physical properties of TOI-375 b are consistent with the core accretion scenario, while the current configuration of the system could be explained by both disk-driven and high-eccentricity migration scenarios. The discovery of TOI-375 as the first known system hosting three or more fully evolved gas giants, with at least one transiting planet, makes it an excellent candidate for testing formation and migration theories.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse's Buddy: X-Ray Constraints on the Nature of $\alpha$ Ori B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\sim$$2100$d Long Secondary Period of Betelgeuse's optical lightcurve and radial velocity motivated the prediction of a low-mass stellar companion, expected to be at maximal apparent separation from Betelgeuse around December 2024. We carried out Director's Discretionary Time observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify any X-ray emission from the companion and constrain its nature as either a compact object or young stellar object (YSO). Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion's orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density $N_H$$=$$6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_X$$\lesssim$$2\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$4.7\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) in $0.5$$-$$8$ keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or $L_X$$\lesssim$$5\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$1.2\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) for an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma$$=$$2$. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse ($\sim$10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities ($10^{28-32}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.</description>

      <title>Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi I: Interpretation and Model Comparison of the Type II Supernova 2024ggi at 55 days Past Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (about 7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at about 55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.</description>

      <title>Hidden massive eclipsing binaries in red supergiant systems: The hierarchical triple system KQ Puppis and other candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are part of binary systems that may interact during their evolution. This has important consequences for systems in which one star develops into a Red supergiant (RSG); however, not many RSGs are known binaries. We aim to better constrain the properties of some of the known RSGs in binaries.
  We first focus on the VV Cephei type RSG KQ Pup (RSG+B-type companion, orbital period of 26 yr), where we have enough data to constrain the system's properties. We use archival photometry and UV spectroscopy, along with newly taken optical spectra and interferometric data. For KQ Pup, as well as for all other Galactic RSGs, we also analyzed the available TESS data.
  Using TESS photometry, we discovered eclipses with a period of $17.2596 \: \rm d$, associated with the hot B companion, making it a Ba+Bb pair. Meanwhile, the detection of the hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line with VLTI-GRAVITY enabled us to track the orbital motion of the KQ Pup Ba+Bb pair and thus to determine the astrometric orbit. The dynamical masses agree with independent estimates from asteroseismology and evolutionary models. The results give a mass of $ \sim 9 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ for the RSG and $ \sim 14 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ for the sum of the hot components Ba+Bb. The observed properties of the system are compatible with a coeval hierarchical triple-star, where we constrain the minimum mass of KQ Pup Bb as $ \gtrsim 1.2 \: \rm M_{\odot} $.
  The variability of Balmer lines and the detection of Br$\gamma$ represent a strong signature of Wind Roche Lobe Overflow, with enhanced signatures of disk-accretion to the Ba+Bb pair during the periastron. Meanwhile, TESS light curves show that about $\sim 10 \%$ of known Galactic binary RSGs may be eclipsing hierarchical triple systems, which suggests that a large fraction of other binary RSGs could also be triples.</description>

Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are one of the most common subclasses of thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin &lt;2d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. Spectra show features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. We gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF shortly after explosion and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our results to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, consistent with previous work. We also find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax are qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Disk Substructures Associated with the Young Eruptive Star EX Lupi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain. We present high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the Very Large Telescope/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.</description>

      <title>Do Outer Giants Inflate Neptune-sized Planets? An Architecture-Dependent Mass-Radius Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographics increasingly reveal that planetary properties depend not only on local irradiation and composition but also on the wider system architecture. We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \pm 4 \%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include prolonged inner-disc gas supply that boosted envelope accretion, and volatile enrichment by the outer giant. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>

Abstract: The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies. Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.</description>
