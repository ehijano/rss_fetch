      <title>Optimal and computationally tractable lower bounds for logistic log-likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logit transform is arguably the most widely-employed link function beyond linear settings. This transformation routinely appears in regression models for binary data and provides a central building-block in popular methods for both classification and regression. Its widespread use, combined with the lack of analytical solutions for the optimization of objective functions involving the logit transform, still motivates active research in computational statistics. Among the directions explored, a central one has focused on the design of tangent lower bounds for logistic log-likelihoods that can be tractably optimized, while providing a tight approximation of these log-likelihoods. This has led to the development of effective minorize-maximize (MM) algorithms for point estimation, and variational schemes for approximate Bayesian inference under several logit models. However, the overarching focus has been on tangent quadratic minorizers. In fact, it is still unclear whether tangent lower bounds sharper than quadratic ones can be derived without undermining the tractability of the resulting minorizer. This article addresses such a question through the design and study of a novel piece-wise quadratic lower bound that uniformly improves any tangent quadratic minorizer, including the sharpest ones, while admitting a direct interpretation in terms of the classical generalized lasso problem. As illustrated in realistic empirical studies, such a sharper bound not only improves the speed of convergence of common MM schemes for penalized maximum likelihood estimation, but also yields tractable variational Bayes (VB) approximations with higher accuracy relative to those obtained under popular quadratic bounds employed in VB.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of Efficient MCMC with Ancillarity-Sufficiency Interweaving Strategy for Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm efficiency is essential for enhancing computational speed and inferential accuracy in Bayesian analysis. These improvements can be effectively achieved using the ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy (ASIS), an effective means of achieving such gains. Herein, we provide the first rigorous theoretical justification for applying ASIS in Bayesian hierarchical panel data models. Asymptotic analysis demonstrated that when the product of prior variance of unobserved heterogeneity and cross-sectional sample size N is sufficiently large, the latent individual effects can be sampled almost independently of their global mean. This near-independence accounts for ASIS's rapid mixing behavior and highlights its suitability for modern "tall" panel datasets. We derived simple inequalities to predict which conventional data augmentation scheme-sufficient augmentation (SA) or ancillary augmentation (AA)-yields faster convergence. By interweaving SA and AA, ASIS achieves optimal geometric rate of convergence and renders the Markov chain for the global mean parameter asymptotically independent and identically distributed. Monte Carlo experiment confirm that this theoretical efficiency ordering holds even for small panels (e.g., N=10). These findings confirm the empirical success of ASIS application across finance, marketing, and sports, laying the groundwork for its extension to models with more complex covariate structures and nonGaussian specifications.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Distributed ECME Algorithm for Matrix Variate Non-Gaussian Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a regression model with matrix-variate skew-t response (REGMVST) for analyzing irregular longitudinal data with skewness, symmetry, or heavy tails. REGMVST models matrix-variate responses and predictors, with rows indexing longitudinal measurements per subject. It uses the matrix-variate skew-t (MVST) distribution to handle skewness and heavy tails, a damped exponential correlation (DEC) structure for row-wise dependencies across irregular time profiles, and leaves the column covariance unstructured. For estimation, we initially develop an ECME algorithm for parameter estimation and further mitigate its computational bottleneck via an asynchronous and distributed ECME (ADECME) extension. ADECME accelerates the E-step through parallelization, and retains the simplicity of the conditional M-step, enabling scalable inference. Simulations using synthetic data and a case study exploring matrix-variate periodontal disease endpoints derived from electronic health records demonstrate ADECME's superiority in efficiency and convergence, over the alternatives. We also provide theoretical support for our empirical observations and identify regularity assumptions for ADECME's optimal performance. An accompanying R package is available at https://github.com/rh8liuqy/STMATREG.</description>
