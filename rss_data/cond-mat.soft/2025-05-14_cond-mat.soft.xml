      <title>Toward Efficient Electrokinetic Energy Conversion with Topographic Modulation of Electrical Conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents experimental and theoretical analyses of electrokinetic flow in microchannels with glass and silica surfaces across a broad range of electrolyte concentrations (0.01 to 100 mM). We demonstrate simple but effective strategies for controlling electrical conduction by engineering nanoscale and microscale topographic features that directly modify the structure and extent of the electric double layer (EDL) and the interfacial ion conduction pathway. These tailored surface topographies modulate the overall electrical conductivity in slit microchannels through similar phenomena documented for nanochannels and nanopores due to the presence of liquidfilled nanoscale topographic features with high concentration of highly mobile protons. The findings of this work reveal that the interaction between tailored surface features and the EDL can substantially enhance energy conversion efficiency in microscale systems. These insights along with simple analytical models provide guidance for the rational design and optimization of scalable electrokinetic devices and are broadly relevant to numerous energy harvesting and charge-separation technologies.</description>

      <title>Real-space observation of salt-dependent aging in Laponite gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal gels gradually evolve as their structures reorganize, a process known as aging. Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase. These findings provide insight into how aging and salt concentration shape the structure and dynamics of colloidal gels.</description>

      <title>Bubble formation in active binary mixture model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation, the spontaneous segregation of density, is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed across diverse physical and biological systems. Within a crowd of self-propelled elements, active phase separation emerges from the interplay of activity and density interactions. A striking feature of active phase separation is the persistent formation of dilute-phase bubbles within the dense phase, which has been explored in theoretical models. However, the fundamental parameters that systematically control bubble formation remain unclear in conventional active particle models. Here, we introduce an active binary mixture model, where active solutes and solvents dynamically exchange their positions, and find that spontaneous bubble formation can be tuned by the asymmetry in their activities. Numerical simulations reveal that moderate solvent activity enhances bubble formation, while larger solvent activity, comparable to solute activity, suppresses it. By employing mean-field theory, which captures essential phase behaviors, we consider the mechanism for the enhancement of bubble formation induced by solvent activity. Beyond these findings, when solute and solvent activities are equal, numerical simulations indicate that critical phenomena of active phase separation under the suppression of bubbles belong to the Ising universality class. Our findings establish activity asymmetry as a key control parameter for active matter phase transitions, offering new insights into universality in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Singular Damped Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromonics are special classes of nematic liquid crystals, for which a quartic elastic theory seems to be more appropriate than the classical quadratic Oseen-Frank theory. The relaxation dynamics of twist director profiles are known to develop a shock wave in finite time in the inviscid case, where dissipation is neglected. This paper studies the dissipative case. We give a sufficient criterion for the formation of shocks in the presence of dissipation and we estimate the critical time at which these singularities develop. Both criterion and estimate depend on the initial director profile. We put our theory to the test on a class of initial kink profiles and we show how accurate our estimates are by comparing them to the outcomes of numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer locomotion and hydrodynamics in Brinkman Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-swimmer locomotion in heterogeneous media is increasingly relevant in biological physics due to the prevalence of microorganisms in complex environments. A model for such porous media is the Brinkman fluid which accounts for a sparse matrix of stationary obstacles via a linear resistance term in the momentum equation. We investigate two models for the locomotion and the flow field generated by a swimmer in such a medium. First, we analyze a dumbbell swimmer composed of two spring-connected spheres and driven by a flagellar force and derive its exact swimming velocity as a function of the Brinkman medium resistance, showing that the swimmer monotonically slows down as the medium drag monotonically increases. In the limit of no resistance the model reduces to the classical Stokes dipole swimmer, while finite resistance introduces hydrodynamic screening that attenuates long-range interactions. Additionally, we derive an analytical expression for the far-field flow generated by a Brinkmanlet force-dipole, which can be used for propulsive point-dipole swimmer models. Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the dumbbell swimmer's flow field in the far-field regime with high accuracy. These results provide new analytical tools for understanding locomotion in complex fluids and offer foundational insights for future studies on collective behavior in active and passive suspensions within porous or structured environments.</description>

      <title>Measurements of molecular size and shape on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Size and shape are critical discriminators between molecular species and states. We describe a micro-chip based high-throughput imaging approach offering rapid and precise determination of molecular properties under native solution conditions. Our method detects differences in molecular weight across at least three orders of magnitude, and down to two carbon atoms in small molecules. We quantify the strength of molecular interactions over six orders of magnitude in affinity constant, and track reactions in real-time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure. We further leverage the method's structural sensitivity for diagnostics, exploiting ligand-induced conformational changes in the insulin receptor to sense insulin concentration in serum at the sub-nanoliter and sub-zeptomole scale.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering Morphologies of Metal-Based Colloidal Assemblies via Colloid Jamming at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal-based sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal-based colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal-based colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Modeling the time evolution of a camphor rotor perturbed by a stationary camphor source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin cylindrical membranes arise in a wide variety of biological systems ranging from tubular structures on and within cell membranes to in-vitro experiments on artificial vesicles. Motor proteins embedded in such fluidic membranes often induce vortex-like flows. In this work, we construct a class of 2D vortex flow in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to 3D external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian, This Hamiltonian also incorporates the specific couplings of the 2D membrane flow with the 3D external fluids. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, such as orbit pinching, For a two-vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time, unlike flat and spherical fluid membranes, where the separation remains constant. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999), now extended to tubular geometries. We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>
