      <title>A pair polarimeter for multi-GeV $\gamma$-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the polarization of photon allows to understand the mechanisms behind its emission or scattering, revealing much about a peculiar environment or a probed object. For energy above $\sim$10~MeV, the pair production dominates the photon-matter interaction and the photon polarization is accessible via the azimuthal angle of the conversion. Unfortunately pair polarimeters have a low figure-of-merit for multi-GeV photons and are mostly used for beam characterization. In this paper, we report a new concept of a compact pair polarimeter associating monolithic active pixel sensors to low-density extended solid converters to reach simultaneously a high efficiency of $\sim$7\% and intrinsic analyzing power ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. This new concept will add a new obersvable to the multi-messenger physics, isolate the intrinsic strong force in nucleons and possibly reveal violations of Lorentz invariance.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Deep Learning for Enhanced Tritium Detection in CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for detecting low-energy beta particles from tritium decay - a critical signal for nuclear safety, nuclear nonproliferation, and environmental monitoring. We employ a dual approach utilizing both measured CCD data and detailed Geant4 simulations. Our analysis compares classical techniques with advanced deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders trained exclusively on tritium data, and preliminary studies on boosted decision trees (BDTs). The CNN, trained on mixed signal/background datasets, demonstrates superior classification performance, while the autoencoder shows the potential of unsupervised, background-agnostic strategies. These results highlight the excellent sensitivity achievable thanks to the background rejection made possible by information-rich CCD data, paving the way for improved portable tritium monitoring.</description>

      <title>Series Testing and Characterization of 1100 Hamamatsu H12700 Multianode Photomultiplier Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the future CBM-RICH and the recently upgraded HADES-RICH use Hamamatsu H12700 Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as their photon detectors. To test the MAPMTs thoroughly before using them in the detectors, the photon sensors were qualified well in advance and a test bench was built to efficiently characterize each MAPMT. The test bench measures the single photoelectron gain, dark rate, relative efficiency, and afterpulse probability of each channel. This article describes the operating principle of the test bench and discusses the distributions of each measured quantity over 1,100 MAPMTs. Additionally, the long-term aging effects of the H12700 MAPMT are investigated based on repeated measurements of individual MAPMTs.</description>

      <title>Shaping circuit for improving linearity, bandwidth, and dynamic range in ToT-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative measurement of energy deposits in particle detectors, particularly in calorimeters, is usually accomplished with the help of Analog-to-Digital converters (ADCs) due to their precision, wide measurement range, and good linearity. However, drawbacks such as power consumption, data volume, and bandwidth limit their use in the next generation of high-energy physics experiments. Time-over-threshold (ToT) systems offer simplicity, low power consumption, easy integrability, and wide bandwidth, but they lack precision, linearity, and dynamic range. In this work, we propose a shaper circuit that improves the weaknesses of ToT systems without sacrificing performance. We simulated and implemented the concept in the readout system of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at FAIR.</description>

      <title>Development of Space Qualified Signal Processing Readout Electronics for HabWorlds and Origins Space Telescope Detector and Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics, will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA-based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>Development of the Range Counter for the COMET Phase-$\alpha$ Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COMET Phase-$\alpha$ experiment aims to evaluate the novel muon transport beamline for the muon-to-electron conversion search at J-PARC, Japan. A dedicated Range Counter (RC) was developed to measure the momentum spectrum of transported negative muons with momenta of 30--100 MeV/$c$. The RC consists of graphite momentum degraders, a muon absorber, and plastic scintillation counters ($\rm T_0$, $\rm T_1$, and $\rm T_2$) to detect decay-in-orbit (DIO) electrons from stopped muons. The number of muons stopped in the absorber is reconstructed from the decay time distribution. A copper absorber was selected due to the short lifetime of muonic atoms in copper, which enhances signal separation. The counters' performance was evaluated experimentally. The $\rm T_0$ Counter, made of a $200\times 200\times 0.5~{\rm mm^3}$ scintillator plate, achieved a muon-trigger efficiency exceeding 99.9%. The $\rm T_1$ and $\rm T_2$ Counters also demonstrated high electron-detection efficiencies of $&gt;99$%. Based on these results, simulation studies estimate the acceptance for reconstructing the number of DIO electrons from the absorber to be approximately 47% with a corresponding signal purity of 60% against muon capture-induced backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with \ensuremath{{50}\,\mathrm{dB}} of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (${200}\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. ${80}\,\mathrm{MHz}$)</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Full Field Fluorescence Imager with Synchrotron Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and evaluation on the NSLS-II beamline of the 3FI application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a simply, planar, two-dimensionally segmented silicon sensor is presented. The ASIC was developed for Full-Field Fluorescence spectral X-ray Imaging (3FI). It is a small-scale prototype that features a square array of 32x32 pixels with a pitch of 100 {\mu}m. The ASIC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. Each pixel incorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier, shaping filter, discriminator, peak detector, and sample-and-hold circuit, allowing detection of events and storing signal amplitudes. The system operates in an event-driven readout mode, outputting analog values for threshold-triggered events, allowing high-speed multi-element X-ray fluorescence imaging. At power consumption of 200 {\mu}W per pixel, consisting almost uniquely of power dissipated in analog blocks, 308 eV full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 8.04 keV, that corresponds to 30 e- rms equivalent noise charge (ENC) and 138 eV FWHM energy resolution at 3.69 keV (16 e- rms ENC) were obtained, for Cu and Ca K{\alpha} lines, respectively. Each pixel operates independently, and the detector enables in situ trace element microanalysis in biological and environmental research. Its architecture addresses limitations of X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM), typically requiring mechanical scanning, by offering frame-lees data acquisition, translating to high-throughput operation. The 3FI ASIC is suitable for example for studies of nutrient cycling in the (mycor)rhizosphere, microbial redox processes, and genotype-phenotype correlations in bio-energy crops. Additional performances, such as enhanced spatial resolution can be further improved with coded-aperture and Wolt, extending the use to environmental, biomedical, and material science studies.</description>
