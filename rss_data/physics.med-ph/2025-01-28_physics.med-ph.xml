      <title>Compensator-based small animal IMRT enables conformal preclinical dose painting: application to tumor hypoxia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques for preclinical intensity modulated radiation therapy are being developed to improve translation by replicating the clinical paradigm. This study presents the first treatment planning comparison between small animal IMRT (SA-IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (CRT) in a model application, oxygen-guided dose painting of tumor hypoxia, using actual mouse data. A novel compensator-based platform was employed to generate SA-IMRT and CRT plans with 2-15 beam angles for seventeen mice with fibrosarcoma tumors. The whole tumor received a dose of 22.5 Gy, with a simultaneous integrated boost of 13 Gy to hypoxic voxels identified via electron paramagnetic resonance imaging. Plan quality was assessed using the Paddick conformity index (CI), uniformity, and dose volume histograms. For 3-angles, SA-IMRT yielded significantly improved dose conformity (median hypoxic CI =0.45 versus 0.17), tumor dose uniformity (11.0% versus 14.3%), and dosimetric spread between boost and non-boost targets (D50% difference = 13.0 Gy [ideal], 13.1 Gy [SA-IMRT], 7. 3 Gy [CRT]). No significant improvement in CI was associated with &gt;3 beam angles (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that SA-IMRT provides significant improvements in radiation plan quality and yields dose distributions that more closely mimic the clinical setting relative to current CRT approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-compartment diffusion-relaxation MR signal representation in the spherical 3D-SHORE basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the diffusion-relaxation magnetic resonance (MR) signal obtained from multi-parametric sequences has recently gained immense interest in the community due to new techniques significantly reducing data acquisition time. A preferred approach for examining the diffusion-relaxation MR data is to follow the continuum modelling principle that employs kernels to represent the tissue features, such as the relaxations or diffusion properties. However, constructing reasonable dictionaries with predefined signal components depends on the sampling density of model parameter space, thus leading to a geometrical increase in the number of atoms per extra tissue parameter considered in the model. That makes estimating the contributions from each atom in the signal challenging, especially considering diffusion features beyond the mono-exponential decay.
  This paper presents a new Multi-Compartment diffusion-relaxation MR signal representation based on the Simple Harmonic Oscillator-based Reconstruction and Estimation (MC-SHORE) representation, compatible with scattered acquisitions. The proposed technique imposes sparsity constraint on the solution via the $\ell_1$ norm and enables the estimation of the microstructural measures, such as the return-to-the-origin probability, and the orientation distribution function, depending on the compartments considered in a single voxel. The procedure has been verified with in silico and in vivo data and enabled the approximation of the diffusion-relaxation MR signal more accurately than single-compartment non-Gaussian representations and multi-compartment mono-exponential decay techniques, maintaining a low number of atoms in the dictionary. Ultimately, the MC-SHORE procedure allows for separating intra-/extra-axonal and free water contributions from the signal, thus reducing the partial volume effect observable in the boundaries of the tissues.</description>

      <title>Evaluating The Performance of Using Large Language Models to Automate Summarization of CT Simulation Orders in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.
  Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.
  Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries. This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</description>

      <title>Marker Track: Accurate Fiducial Marker Tracking for Evaluation of Residual Motions During Breath-Hold Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiducial marker positions in projection image of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans have been studied to evaluate daily residual motion during breath-hold radiation therapy. Fiducial marker migration posed challenges in accurately locating markers, prompting the development of a novel algorithm that reconstructs volumetric probability maps of marker locations from filtered gradient maps of projections. This guides the development of a Python-based algorithm to detect fiducial markers in projection images using Meta AI's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). Retrospective data from a pancreatic cancer patient with two fiducial markers were analyzed. The three-dimensional (3D) marker positions from simulation computed tomography (CT) were compared to those reconstructed from CBCT images, revealing a decrease in relative distances between markers over time. Fiducial markers were successfully detected in 2777 out of 2786 projection frames. The average standard deviation of superior-inferior (SI) marker positions was 0.56 mm per breath-hold, with differences in average SI positions between two breath-holds in the same scan reaching up to 5.2 mm, and a gap of up to 7.3 mm between the end of the first and beginning of the second breath-hold. 3D marker positions were calculated using projection positions and confirmed marker migration. This method effectively calculates marker probability volume and enables accurate fiducial marker tracking during treatment without requiring any specialized equipment, additional radiation doses, or manual initialization and labeling. It has significant potential for automatically assessing daily residual motion to adjust planning margins, functioning as an adaptive radiation therapy tool.</description>

      <title>Implementation of X-rays production in LegPy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LegPy package has been upgraded by including the production of X-ray fluorescence based on a simple model. Several tests have been done to check the validity of our approximations. This simple model has been sufficient to fix severe deviations of LegPy with respect to the well-established code PENELOPE in those particular cases for which fluorescence emission has a relevant impact.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of the Activity and the Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling: a Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for joint reconstruction of the activity and the attenuation (JRAA) in positron emission tomography (PET) using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS). By leveraging diffusion models (DMs), this approach directly addresses activity-attenuation dependencies, mitigating crosstalk issues prevalent in non-time-of-flight (TOF) settings. Experimental evaluations, conducted using 2-dimensional (2-D) XCAT phantom data, demonstrate that DPS significantly outperforms traditional maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) methods, producing consistent and high-quality reconstructions even in the absence of TOF information. Ongoing work aims to extend our method to real 3-dimensional (3-D) data with encouraging preliminary findings.</description>
