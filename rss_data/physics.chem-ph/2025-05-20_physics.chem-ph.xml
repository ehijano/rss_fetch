      <title>Spin manipulation and nuclear polarization enhancement in particle beams with static magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical study of spin dynamics in non-relativistic particle beams with interacting angular momenta traversing static, spatially varying magnetic fields is presented. The computational framework evaluates sinusoidal magnetic field configurations, calculating key observables such as average spin projections and state populations during the interaction. It is demonstrated that such fields can effectively enhance nuclear polarization in partially, incoherently polarized hydrogen and deuterium atomic beams, as well as coherently rotationally state-selected hydrogen deuteride molecular beams. This enhancement is attributed to transitions induced within the hyperfine regime of these systems. The study spans frequency ranges from GHz scales for atoms to hundreds of kHz for molecules, corresponding to magnetic field variations on spatial scales from submillimeters to meters.</description>

      <title>HORM: A Large Scale Molecular Hessian Database for Optimizing Reactive Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition state (TS) characterization is central to computational reaction modeling, yet conventional approaches depend on expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, limiting their scalability. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate TS searches by approximating quantum-level accuracy at a fraction of the cost. However, most MLIPs are primarily designed for energy and force prediction, thus their capacity to accurately estimate Hessians, which are crucial for TS optimization, remains constrained by limited training data and inadequate learning strategies. This work introduces the Hessian dataset for Optimizing Reactive MLIP (HORM), the largest quantum chemistry Hessian database dedicated to reactive systems, comprising 1.84 million Hessian matrices computed at the $\omega$B97x/6-31G(d) level of theory. To effectively leverage this dataset, we adopt a Hessian-informed training strategy that incorporates stochastic row sampling, which addresses the dramatically increased cost and complexity of incorporating second-order information into MLIPs. Various MLIP architectures and force prediction schemes trained on HORM demonstrate up to 63% reduction in the Hessian mean absolute error and up to 200 times increase in TS search compared to models trained without Hessian information. These results highlight how HORM addresses critical data and methodological gaps, enabling the development of more accurate and robust reactive MLIPs for large-scale reaction network exploration.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</description>

      <title>An improved guess for the variational calculation of charge-transfer excitations in large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-transfer excited states are highly relevant for applications in molecular electronics. However, the accurate calculation of these states in large systems is challenging since wave function methods are prohibitively expensive, time-dependent density functional theory with typical functionals is not precise, and the complicated topology of the electronic hypersurface makes the variational convergence to the targeted excited states a difficult task. We address the latter aspect by providing suitable initial guesses which we obtain by two separate constrained algorithms. Combined with subsequent squared-gradient minimization schemes, we demonstrate that OO-DFT calculations can reliably converge to the charge-transfer states of interest even for large molecular systems. We test this approach on two chemically very different supramolecular structures and also analyze the performance of two recently proposed methods for the tuning of the range-separation parameter in time-dependent DFT with range-separated hybrid functionals. Our results demonstrate that with the methods presented here, reliable convergence of charge-transfer excited states can be achieved with variational excited-state DFT methods, while time-dependent DFT calculations with an adequate tuning procedure for the range-separation parameter can provide a computationally efficient initial estimate of the corresponding energies.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Layer-Dependent Molecular Twisting for the Structural Anisotropy of Interfacial Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique structural properties of interfacial water are at the heart of a vast range of important processes in electrochemistry, climate science, and biophysics. At interfaces, water molecules exhibit preferential orientations and an altered intermolecular H-bond connectivity. Characterising this layer-dependent anisotropic structure for such a thin molecular boundary, however, is a veritable challenge, with many important details remaining unknown. Here, we combine a novel depth-resolved second-order spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to study the anisotropic structure at the air-water interface through the H-O-H bending vibration. We firstly show that the experimental nonlinear spectrum contains a large bulk like (quadrupolar) contribution that has hampered the assessment of the interfacial structure in previous investigations. By subtracting this contribution, we uncover the elusive anisotropic interfacial response that quantitatively matches the simulated prediction. Thereafter, by analysing both the vibrational line-shape of the interfacial spectrum and its depth-dependence, we demonstrate that both the molecular tilt and twist angles of water must be highly restricted at the interface, which is confirmed by the simulated orientational distribution. Finally, by analysing the depth and orientation dependence of the bending frequency, we show substantial deviations from the expected behaviour, revealing an anomalous character to the interfacial H-bond network.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Polaron Spectral Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multireference Embedding and Fragmentation Methods for Classical and Quantum Computers: from Model Systems to Realistic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in quantum chemistry is the accurate modeling of strong electron correlation. While multireference methods effectively capture such correlation, their steep scaling with system size prohibits their application to large molecules and extended materials. Quantum embedding offers a promising solution by partitioning complex systems into manageable subsystems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in multireference density matrix embedding and localized active space self-consistent field approaches for complex molecules and extended materials. We discuss both classical implementations and the emerging potential of these methods on quantum computers. By extending classical embedding concepts to the quantum landscape, these algorithms have the potential to expand the reach of multireference methods in quantum chemistry and materials.</description>

      <title>The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</description>

      <title>On Robust $\beta$-Spectra Shape Parameter Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental extraction of $\beta$-shape functions, C(W), is challenging. Comparing different experimental $\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients.</description>

      <title>The role of confined water in the emergence of electrostatic strong coupling as revealed by nanoseparated charged lipid layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates water transport in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer using operando infrared spectroscopic imaging. By testing different H2SO4 anolyte concentrations, it examines electrochemical performance, water diffusion, and membrane hydration. Higher anolyte concentrations increased standard deviations in current densities and led to water diffusion gradients revealed by infrared imaging and confirming localized water transport variations. The study highlights the need for improved water management and optimized electrolyzer design for stable and efficient PEM electrolysis in industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments highlighting the promise of two-dimensional perovskites have vastly increased the compositional search space in the perovskite family. This presents a great opportunity for the realization of highly performant devices, and practical challenges associated with the identification of candidate materials. High-fidelity computational screening offers great value in this regard. In this study, we carry out a multiscale computational workflow, generating a dataset of two-dimensional perovskites in the Dion-Jacobson and Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Our dataset comprises ten B-site cations, four halogens, and over 20 organic cations across over 2,000 materials. We compute electronic properties, thermoelectric performance, and numerous geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for the high-throughput computation of Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting. Finally, we use this dataset to train machine learning models for the accurate prediction of band gaps, candidate Rashba-Dresselhaus materials, and partial charges. The work presented herein can aid future investigations of two-dimensional perovskites with targeted applications in mind.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of sulfur chemistry in a validated C/H/O/N chemical network: identification of key C/S coupling pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of SO2 in both WASP-39 b and WASP-107 b recently brought more attention to the modeling of photochemistry in exoplanets. However, sulfur kinetics data is lacking in the literature for the full C/H/O/N/S system. The networks used to model this chemistry neglect the coupling between sulfur and other C/H/O/N species. We aimed to integrate sulfur kinetics to our previously developed C_0-C_2/H/O/N chemical network, with the inclusion of its coupling to carbon and nitrogen chemistry, for conditions between 500 - 2500 K and 100 - 10^-6 bar, and any atomic composition. To achieve this reliability, we used a dual approach, deriving the network from other available combustion networks and from original ab initio calculations where data was lacking. This was performed together with an extensive validation of the network on 1606 experimental measurements from the literature on the combustion and pyrolysis of multiple sulfur compounds such as H2S, CH3SH, CS2 and OCS. To examine the consequences of this new chemical network on exoplanets atmospheric studies, we generated abundance profiles for GJ 436 b, GJ 1214 b, HD 189733 b, HD 209458 b, WASP-39 b and WASP-107 b using the 1D kinetic model FRECKLL, calculated the corresponding transmission spectra using TauREx 3.1 and compared these results with other chemical networks used in exoplanet modeling with sulfur. The coupling between carbon and sulfur chemistry is found to be impactful on both abundance profiles and observables, with CH2S being its key species. CS2 abundance is found to be probably much higher than anticipated in current kinetic networks for exoplanets. The detection of CS2 in TOI-270 d highlights the importance of using validated chemical networks to improve the reliability of our models, particularly in the JWST era. Combustion and pyrolysis data are largely available tools that reveal to be very useful for this task.</description>

      <title>LLM Context Conditioning and PWP Prompting for Multimodal Validation of Chemical Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs) whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available, general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single, complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably, this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited PoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bond Topology Reveals Layering of LDL-like and HDL-like Water at its Liquid/Vapor Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) water has been a major success of molecular simulations, yet extending this analysis to interfacial water is challenging due to conventional order parameters assuming local homogeneity. This limitation previously prevented resolving the composition of the surface layer of the liquid/vapour interface. Here, we apply a recently introduced topological order parameter [R. Foffi and F. Sciortino, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 378-386 (2022)] to analyze the composition of the water/vapor interface across a broad temperature range. Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of coherence in molecular dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate experimentally measurable signatures of quantum correlations in a coupled molecular dimer that strongly interacts with its vibrational environment. We investigate intensity and mode-resolved photon coincidences for different relative orientations of such dimers, and observe spatio-temporal correlations for various configurations. We find that projective measurements can produce cooperative signatures even when emitters are arranged orthogonal to each other. To model effects of vibrational environments that are present in realistic experimental situations, we use the polaron framework. Further, we also account for the effects of finite instrument response, varying temperature, and presence of static disorder. We analyse the effect of disorder in both dimer orientation and measurement direction and find that photon coincidences remain well-resolvable using state-of-the-art detectors. This work enhances our understanding of cooperative emission from two coupled emitters and offers direction for future experiments on probing their coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Production of Spin-Polarized Molecular Beams via Microwave or Infrared Rotational Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how small molecules in an intense and cold molecular beam can be highly nuclear-spin polarized via microwave or infrared rotational excitation schemes, followed by hyperfine-induced quantum beats. Repumping schemes can be used to achieve polarization above $90\%$ in cases where single-pumping schemes are insufficient. Projected production rates in excess of $10^{21}$ ${\text{s}^{-1}}$ allow applications including nuclear-magnetic-resonance signal enhancement, and spin-polarized nuclear fusion, where polarized nuclei are known to enhance D-T and D-$^3$He fusion cross sections by $50\%$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the spontaneous conversion of layered MAX phases to 2D MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topochemically transforming layered non-van der Waals solid into two dimensional (2D) materials involves selective etching reactions with atomic precision. The element-specific, structure-sensitive etching at nanoscale urgently requires in-depth understanding. Here, by means of density functional theory calculations and a laboratory-made operando reaction monitoring platform, the mechanism of instantaneous transforming MAX phase into MXenes is unraveled. The overall etching kinetics exhibits a sigmoidal curve, following self-accelerating reaction character with a small activation energy of ca. 60 kJ/mol. Interestingly, this activation energy corresponds to the Al transport through Ti3C2 slits. Therefore the reaction of Al with hydrofluoric acid solution in the confined interlayer space is recognized as the rate-determining step. Last but not the least, we found that the match of A element and etchants to form stable products is critical for the etching reaction, and reaction energy derived from the thermodynamics provides an easy yet effective descriptor for screening efficient etchants.</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Spectroscopy of h-BN Point Defect Fluorescence in Liquid Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, analyzing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. We present a strategy that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as sensitive ion detectors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Following this approach, we showed that each individual single point defect can be used to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electric fields, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct visualization of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to the millimolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Tensor Product Functions in Representing Antisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor product function (TPF) approximations have been widely adopted in solving high-dimensional problems, such as partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems, achieving desirable accuracy with computational overhead that scales linearly with problem dimensions. However, recent studies have underscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum many-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key distinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown functions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number of involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases exponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both traditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural networks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this class and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical Polyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings uncover a fundamental incompatibility between antisymmetry and low-rank TPFs in high-dimensional contexts and offer new insights for further developments.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Cartesian Network for 3D Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</description>
