      <title>Exploration of the potential energy surface for the conformational interconversion of the amyloid $\beta$ peptide at the fibril end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of amyloid fibrils comprising amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides is associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we theoretically investigated the A$\beta$ structure at the fibril end using the density functional theory calculation. Several twisted conformations were identified as local minima in which a part of the peptide chain bends upward while the rest remains bound to the lower A$\beta$ monomer. Fibril-to-twisted conformational transition exhibited endothermic behavior, with endothermic energy increasing as more backbone hydrogen bonds were broken. In addition, the loss of van der Waals interaction from the hydrophobic sidechain contributed to endothermicity. The nudged elastic band method was applied to analyze the potential energy surface connecting the fibril and twisted conformations. Comparison of the activation barriers between different twisted conformations revealed that certain twisted conformations returned relatively easily to the fibril conformation, whereas others encountered a higher activation barrier and reverted less readily. Detailed structural analysis revealed that the twisted conformation's propensity to return originates from the local steric hindrance imposed by the sidechain near the torsional axis.</description>

      <title>Effective synchronization amid noise-induced chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is exposing them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. Namely, although the phases of the two clocks vary erratically, their probability distributions at a given moment become identical. We exploit this statistical synchrony to define an effective phase for an agent that closely agrees with the other's phase. We discuss how this synchronization of ensembles broadens the range in which noise-induced synchronization can be used, and how it might be exploited in living systems.</description>

      <title>SpectraMatcher: A Python Program for Interactive Analysis and Peak Assignment of Vibronic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SpectraMatcher is a cross-platform desktop application for interactive comparison of experimental and computed vibronic spectra, designed to assist in the recognition and assignment of spectral patterns. It provides an intuitive graphical interface -- with no coding or scripting required -- for importing experimental spectra, visualizing them alongside the corresponding theoretical spectra constructed from Gaussian frequency calculations, and adjusting key parameters such as peak width, intensity scaling factors, and vibration-type-specific anharmonic corrections. SpectraMatcher features an automated peak-matching algorithm that assigns experimental and computed peaks based on their intensity ratio and proximity. Assignments and spectra can be exported in multiple formats for publication or for further analysis. The software remains responsive even for large datasets, and supports efficient and reproducible interpretation of vibronic spectra.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic diffusion in sheared active suspensions of squirmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how shear influences the dynamics of active particles in dilute to concentrated suspensions. Specifically, we focus on apolar active suspensions of squirmers, which are individually immotile but display activity-induced hydrodynamic diffusion. Under shear, the instantaneous particle velocities fluctuate more rapidly, similar to passive suspensions; however, surprisingly, the long-time diffusive dynamics can slow down and exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the shear rate. We show that this behavior arises from an interplay between the activity-induced persistent motion and shear-induced negative velocity autocorrelation, both of which are more pronounced at lower volume fractions. Simulations of self-propelled particles with tunable persistence support this explanation and further offer a simple mechanism to understand the observed coupling. Our results reveal a generic effect of shear on diffusion in active suspensions, elucidate how internal and external forcing interact, and provide new possibilities to modulate transport in active fluids.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Optimal navigation of magnetic artificial microswimmers in blood capillaries with deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, microsurgery, and sensing rely on reaching precise areas within the body in a minimally invasive way. Artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs) have emerged as potential tools for this task by navigating through the circulatory system with the help of external magnetic fields. While their swimming characteristics are well understood in simple settings, their controlled navigation through realistic capillary networks remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of blood flow and the high computational cost of detailed simulations. We address this challenge by conducting numerical simulations of ABFs in retinal capillaries, propelled by an external magnetic field. The simulations are based on a validated blood model that predicts the dynamics of individual red blood cells and their hydrodynamic interactions with ABFs. The magnetic field follows a control policy that brings the ABF to a prescribed target. The control policy is learned with an actor-critic, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with a reduced-order model of the system. We show that the same policy robustly guides the ABF to a prescribed target in both the reduced-order model and the fine-grained blood simulations. This approach is suitable for designing robust control policies for personalized medicine at moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>Soft matter mechanics of immune cell aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T-cells are a crucial subset of white blood cells that play a central role in the immune system. When T-cells bind antigens, it leads to cell activation and the induction of an immune response. If T-cells are activated by antigens in vivo or artificially in vitro, they form multicellular aggregates. The mechanical properties of such clusters provide valuable information on different T-cell activation pathways. Furthermore, the aggregate mechanics capture how T-cells are affected by mechanical forces and interact within larger conglomerates, such as lymph nodes and tumours. However, an understanding of collective T-cell adhesion and mechanics following cell activation is currently lacking. Probing the mechanics of fragile and microscopically small living samples is experimentally challenging. Here, the micropipette force sensor technique was used to stretch T-cell aggregates and directly measure their Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. A mechanistic model was developed to correlate how the stiffness of the mesoscale multicellular aggregate emerges from the mechanical response of the individual microscopic cells within the cluster. We show how the aggregate elasticity is affected by different activators and relate this to different activation pathways in the cells. Our soft matter mechanics study of multicellular T-cell aggregates contributes to our understanding of the biology behind immune cell activation.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</description>
