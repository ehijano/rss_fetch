      <title>Energy partitioning between thermal and non-thermal electrons and ions in magnetotail reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Heavy Ion Abundances with Solar Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When observed at 1 AU, slow solar wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions with magnetic topologies that are intermittently open to the heliosphere. Fast wind is typically considered to have originated in source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere eg coronal holes. The evolution of the solar wind helium abundance (AHe) with solar activity is likely driven by the evolution of different solar wind source regions. Separating the solar wind into fast and slow for each element based on its characteristic speed derived in Alterman et al. (2025) we quantify the evolution of helium and heavy element abundances $(X/H):(X/H)_\mathrm{photo}$ with solar activity. We show that AHe strongly correlates with sunspot number; in slow and fast wind the average non-transient solar wind AHe is limited to 51% of its photospheric value; slow wind heavy element abundances evolve significantly with solar activity; fast wind heavy element abundances do not; the correlation coefficient with sunspot number of elemental abundances for species heavier than He monotonically increases with increasing mass; and the correlation coefficients between the in situ observations and the normalized sunspot number are stronger than those using the unnormalized sunspot number. We infer that the sunspot number is a clock timing the solar cycle but not the driver of the physical process underlying the evolution of these abundances with solar activity; this underlying process is likely related to the energy available to accelerate the solar plasma from the chromosphere and transition region or low corona into the solar wind; and differences between the evolution of slow and fast solar wind abundances are similarly related to the energy available to accelerate the elements at these heights above the Suns surface.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Impact of Alfv\'en Wave Forcing in Interplanetary Space on the Distribution of near-Earth Solar Wind Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\'en wave energy deposition and thermal pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously identify source region topology.
  Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to the continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\'en wave forcing during the solar wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's Alfv\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source regions because the Alfv\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in transit is a consequence of the source region topology.</description>
