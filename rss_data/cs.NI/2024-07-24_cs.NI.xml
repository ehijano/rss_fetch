      <title>Convexification of the Quantum Network Utility Maximisation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Utility Maximisation (NUM) addresses the problem of allocating resources fairly within a network and explores the ways to achieve optimal allocation in real-world networks. Although extensively studied in classical networks, NUM is an emerging area of research in the context of quantum networks. In this work, we consider the quantum network utility maximisation (QNUM) problem in a static setting, where a user's utility takes into account the assigned quantum quality (fidelity) via a generic entanglement measure as well as the corresponding rate of entanglement generation. Under certain assumptions, we demonstrate that the QNUM problem can be formulated as an optimisation problem with the rate allocation vector as the only decision variable. Using a change of variable technique known in the field of geometric programming, we then establish sufficient conditions under which this formulation can be reduced to a convex problem, a class of optimisation problems that can be solved efficiently and with certainty even in high dimensions. We further show that this technique preserves convexity, enabling us to formulate convex QNUM problems in networks where some routes have certain entanglement measures that do not readily admit convex formulation, while others do. This allows us to compute the optimal resource allocation in networks where heterogeneous applications run over different routes.</description>

      <title>Region-based Content Enhancement for Efficient Video Analytics at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video analytics is widespread in various applications serving our society. Recent advances of content enhancement in video analytics offer significant benefits for the bandwidth saving and accuracy improvement. However, existing content-enhanced video analytics systems are excessively computationally expensive and provide extremely low throughput. In this paper, we present region-based content enhancement, that enhances only the important regions in videos, to improve analytical accuracy. Our system, RegenHance, enables high-accuracy and high-throughput video analytics at the edge by 1) a macroblock-based region importance predictor that identifies the important regions fast and precisely, 2) a region-aware enhancer that stitches sparsely distributed regions into dense tensors and enhances them efficiently, and 3) a profile-based execution planer that allocates appropriate resources for enhancement and analytics components. We prototype RegenHance on five heterogeneous edge devices. Experiments on two analytical tasks reveal that region-based enhancement improves the overall accuracy of 10-19% and achieves 2-3x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art frame-based enhancement methods.</description>

      <title>Applications of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Communication in Network Management: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the automation of network management, also known as Autonomous Driving Networks (ADN), is gaining widespread attention. The network management has shifted from traditional homogeneity and centralization to heterogeneity and decentralization. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) allows agents to make decisions based on local observations independently. This approach is in line with the needs of automation and has garnered significant attention from academia and industry. In a distributed environment, information interaction between agents can effectively address the non-stationarity problem of multiple agents and promote cooperation. Therefore, in this survey, we first examined the application of MADRL in network management, including specific application fields such as traffic engineering, wireless network access, power control, and network security. Then, we conducted a detailed analysis of communication behavior between agents, including communication schemes, communication content construction, communication object selection, message processing, and communication constraints. Finally, we discussed the open issues and future research directions of agent communication in MADRL for future network management and ADN applications.</description>

      <title>The Architectural Refinement of {\mu}D3TN: Toward a Software-Defined DTN Protocol Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the uD3TN project's development, detailing its transformation into a flexible and modular software implementation of the Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol. Originating from uPCN, designed for microcontrollers, uD3TN has undergone significant architectural refinement to increase flexibility, compatibility, and performance across various DTN applications. Key developments include achieving platform independence, supporting multiple Bundle Protocol versions concurrently, introducing abstract Convergence Layer Adapter (CLA) interfaces, and developing the so called Application Agent Protocol (AAP) for interaction with the application layer. Additional enhancements, informed by field tests, include Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation and exploring a port to the Rust programming language, indicating the project's ongoing adaptation to practical needs. The paper also introduces the Generic Bundle Forwarding Interface and AAPv2, showcasing the latest innovations in the project. Moreover, it provides a comparison of uD3TN's architecture with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) protocol stack, highlighting some general architectural principles at the foundation of DTN protocol implementations.</description>

      <title>The Rise of UAV Fleet Technologies for Emergency Wireless Communications in Harsh Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For unforeseen emergencies, such as natural disasters and pandemic events, it is highly demanded to cope with the explosive growth of mobile data traffic in extremely critical environments. An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fleet is an effective way to facilitate the Emergency wireless COmmunication NETwork (EcoNet). In this article, a MUlti-tier Heterogeneous UAV Network (MuHun), which is with different UAV fleets in different altitudes, is proposed to flexibly serve various emergencies. We refresh the key performance indicators of full coverage, network capacity, low latency, and energy efficiency in harsh environments. Then, we present the special challenges regarding shadowing-dominated complex channel model, energy supply limited short-endurance, various communication mechanisms coexistence, and communication island for underground users in UAV-based EcoNet, followed by the MuHun-based EcoNet architecture and its advantages. Furthermore, some potential solutions such as the new hybrid-channel adapted resource allocation, reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted UAV communications, competitive heterogenous-networks, and magnetic induction based air-to-ground/underground communications are discussed to effectively achieve full coverage, high capacity, high energy efficiency, and diverse qualities of services for EcoNets in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Testing Large Language Models on Driving Theory Knowledge and Skills for Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling long tail corner cases is a major challenge faced by autonomous vehicles (AVs). While large language models (LLMs) hold great potentials to handle the corner cases with excellent generalization and explanation capabilities and received increasing research interest on application to autonomous driving, there are still technical barriers to be tackled, such as strict model performance and huge computing resource requirements of LLMs. In this paper, we investigate a new approach of applying remote or edge LLMs to support autonomous driving. A key issue for such LLM assisted driving system is the assessment of LLMs on their understanding of driving theory and skills, ensuring they are qualified to undertake safety critical driving assistance tasks for CAVs. We design and run driving theory tests for several proprietary LLM models (OpenAI GPT models, Baidu Ernie and Ali QWen) and open-source LLM models (Tsinghua MiniCPM-2B and MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5) with more than 500 multiple-choices theory test questions. Model accuracy, cost and processing latency are measured from the experiments. Experiment results show that while model GPT-4 passes the test with improved domain knowledge and Ernie has an accuracy of 85% (just below the 86% passing threshold), other LLM models including GPT-3.5 fail the test. For the test questions with images, the multimodal model GPT4-o has an excellent accuracy result of 96%, and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5 achieves an accuracy of 76%. While GPT-4 holds stronger potential for CAV driving assistance applications, the cost of using model GPT4 is much higher, almost 50 times of that of using GPT3.5. The results can help make decision on the use of the existing LLMs for CAV applications and balancing on the model performance and cost.</description>

      <title>Software Defined Vehicles for Development of Deterministic Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With modern vehicles evolving with more features, services, complex systems, with more sensors, actuators, and processing units, it is essential to think about vehicles not only as means of transportation that may tend towards full autonomy, but also as adaptive objects, that suit themselves to the needs of occupants. Vehicular services can be developed to support these adaptations. However, the increasing complexity of vehicular service development, even with current standardizations and best practices and guidelines, are insufficient to tackle the high complexity of development, with expectations of up to 1 (U.S.) billion lines of code for a fully (level 5) autonomous vehicle. Within this survey, the paradigm of Deterministic Software Defined Vehicles is explored towards increasing the quality and easiness of the development of services for automotive. Towards this, a proposed vision with four pillars is also provided: the deterministic network configurator, the data layer configurator, and the hypervisor configurator and the vehicle abstraction layer, all coordinated by a software orchestrator.</description>

Abstract: Number of IoT enabled devices are being tried and introduced every year and there is a healthy competition among researched and businesses to capitalize the space created by IoT, as these devices have a great market potential. Depending on the type of task involved and sensitive nature of data that the device handles, various IoT architectures, communication protocols and components are chosen and their performance is evaluated. This paper reviews such IoT enabled devices based on their architecture, communication protocols and functions in few key socially relevant fields like health care, farming, firefighting, women/individual safety/call for help/harm alert, home surveillance and mapping as these fields involve majority of the general public. It can be seen, to one's amazement, that already significant number of devices are being reported on these fields and their performance is promising. This paper also outlines the challenges involved in each of these fields that require solutions to make these devices reliable</description>

      <title>STrack: A Reliable Multipath Transport for AI/ML Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads present new challenges of managing the collective communication used in distributed training across hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. This paper presents STrack, a novel hardware-offloaded reliable transport protocol aimed at improving the performance of AI /ML workloads by rethinking key aspects of the transport layer. STrack optimizes congestion control and load balancing in tandem: it incorporates an adaptive load balancing algorithm leveraging ECN, while adopts RTT as multi-bit congestion indicators for precise congestion window adjustment. Additionally, STrack facilitates out-of-order delivery, selective retransmission, and swift loss recovery in hardware for multipath environment. The extensive simulation comparing STrack and RoCEv2 demonstrates that STrack outperforms RoCEv2 by up to 6X with synthetic workloads and by 27.4% with collective workloads, even with the optimized RoCEv2 system setup.</description>
