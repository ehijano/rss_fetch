      <title>Heating of Cs2Te Photocathode via Field Emission and RF Pulsed Heating: Implication Toward Breakdown</title>

Abstract: The occurrence of radio-frequency (rf) breakdown limits operational electromagnetic gradients in accelerator structures. Experimental evidence often suggests that breakdown events are associated with temperature and dark current spikes on the surface of rf devices. In the past decade, there has been increased interest in unveiling the mechanism behind breakdown initiation in metal copper and copper alloys. However, effort regarding breakdown phenomenon in photocathode relevant semiconductors have been more limited. In this work, we explore field-emission-assisted heating via Nottingham and Joule processes, as a possible candidate for breakdown initiation. For this, field emission from intrinsic Cs2Te ultra-thin film coated on a copper substrate was modeled within the Stratton/Baskin/Lvov/Fursey (SBLF) formalism, describing the processes and effects in the bulk and on the surface of a photocathode exposed to high radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. It is shown that field emission characteristic deviates significantly from the classical Fowler-Nordheim (FN) theory, whereby predicting that dark current is orders of magnitude lower than one expected by FN law. Conventional pulsed heating was also found to impose negligible heating to the photo-cathode. Both conclusions suggest that Cs2Te photocathode coated on a metal substrate would be insensitive to catastrophic thermal-material runaway breakdown, unlike what is observed for metal surfaces. Finally, a few unconventional breakdown candidate scenarios are identified and discussed including thermo-elastic deformation and avalanche breakdown.</description>
