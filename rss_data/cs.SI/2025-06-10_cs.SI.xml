      <title>A Benchmarking Framework for Network Classification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network classification plays a crucial role in the study of complex systems, impacting fields like biology, sociology, and computer science. In this research, we present an innovative benchmark dataset made up of synthetic networks that are categorized into various classes and subclasses. This dataset is specifically crafted to test the effectiveness and resilience of different network classification methods. To put these methods to the test, we also introduce various types and levels of structural noise. We evaluate five feature extraction techniques: traditional structural measures, Life-Like Network Automata (LLNA), Graph2Vec, Deterministic Tourist Walk (DTW), and its improved version, the Deterministic Tourist Walk with Bifurcation (DTWB). Our experimental results reveal that DTWB surpasses the other methods in classifying both classes and subclasses, even when faced with significant noise. LLNA and DTW also perform well, while Graph2Vec lands somewhere in the middle in terms of accuracy. Interestingly, topological measures, despite their simplicity and common usage, consistently show the weakest classification performance. These findings underscore the necessity of robust feature extraction techniques for effective network classification, particularly in noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Overlap-Aware High-Order Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic graph learning (DGL) aims to learn informative and temporally-evolving node embeddings to support downstream tasks such as link prediction. A fundamental challenge in DGL lies in effectively modeling both the temporal dynamics and structural dependencies of evolving graph topologies. Recent advances in Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have obtained remarkable success by leveraging message-passing mechanisms to capture pairwise node interactions. However, these approaches often overlook more complex structural patterns, particularly neighborhood overlap, which can play a critical role in characterizing node interactions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Neighborhood Overlap-Aware High-Order Graph Neural Network (NO-HGNN), which is built upon two key innovations: (a) computing a correlation score based on the extent of neighborhood overlap to better capture complex node interactions; and (b) embedding this correlation directly into the message-passing process of high-order graph neural networks in the DGL. Experiments on two real-world dynamic graphs show that NO-HGNN achieves notable improvements in link prediction accuracy, outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-triangle eigenvector centrality of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrality represents a fundamental research field in complex network analysis, where centrality measures identify important vertices within networks. Over the years, researchers have developed diverse centrality measures from varied perspectives. This paper proposes an $\alpha$-triangle eigenvector centrality ($\alpha$TEC), which is a global centrality measure based on both edge and triangle structures. It can dynamically adjust the influence of edges and triangles through a parameter $\alpha$ ($\alpha \in (0,1]$). The centrality scores for vertices are defined as the eigenvector corresponding to the spectral radius of a nonnegative tensor. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, $\alpha$TEC guarantees unique positive centrality scores for all vertices in connected graphs. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world networks demonstrate that $\alpha$TEC effectively identifies the vertex's structural positioning within graphs. As $\alpha$ increases (decreases), the centrality rankings reflect a stronger (weaker) contribution from edge structure and a weaker (stronger) contribution from triangle structure. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that vertices with higher $\alpha$TEC rankings have a greater impact on network connectivity.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Embedding for Node Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Powers of Magnetic Graph Matrix: Fourier Spectrum, Walk Compression, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic graphs, originally developed to model quantum systems under magnetic fields, have recently emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing complex directed networks. Existing research has primarily used the spectral properties of the magnetic graph matrix to study global and stationary network features. However, their capacity to model local, non-equilibrium behaviors, often described by matrix powers, remains largely unexplored. We present a novel combinatorial interpretation of the magnetic graph matrix powers through directed walk profiles -- counts of graph walks indexed by the number of edge reversals. Crucially, we establish that walk profiles correspond to a Fourier transform of magnetic matrix powers. The connection allows exact reconstruction of walk profiles from magnetic matrix powers at multiple discrete potentials, and more importantly, an even smaller number of potentials often suffices for accurate approximate reconstruction in real networks. This shows the empirical compressibility of the information captured by the magnetic matrix. This fresh perspective suggests new applications; for example, we illustrate how powers of the magnetic matrix can identify frustrated directed cycles (e.g., feedforward loops) and can be effectively employed for link prediction by encoding local structural details in directed graphs.</description>

      <title>PolitiSky24: U.S. Political Bluesky Dataset with User Stance Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce. User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and user-level perspective. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15616911</description>

      <title>Refugees' path to legal stability is long and systematically unequal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal systems shape not only the recognition of migrants and refugees but also the pace and stability of their integration. Refugees often shift between multiple legal classifications, a process we refer to as the "legal journey". This journey is frequently prolonged and uncertain. Using a network-based approach, we analyze legal transitions for over 350,000 migrants in Austria (2022 to 2024). Refugees face highly unequal pathways to stability, ranging from two months for Ukrainians to nine months for Syrians and 20 months for Afghans. Women, especially from these regions, are more likely to gain protection; Afghan men wait up to 30 months on average. We also find that those who cross the border without going through official border controls face higher exit rates and lower chances of securing stable status. We show that legal integration is not a uniform process, but one structured by institutional design, procedural entry points, and unequal timelines.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Artificial Intelligence for Complex Network: Potential, Methodology and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks pervade various real-world systems, from the natural environment to human societies. The essence of these networks is in their ability to transition and evolve from microscopic disorder-where network topology and node dynamics intertwine-to a macroscopic order characterized by certain collective behaviors. Over the past two decades, complex network science has significantly enhanced our understanding of the statistical mechanics, structures, and dynamics underlying real-world networks. Despite these advancements, there remain considerable challenges in exploring more realistic systems and enhancing practical applications. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, coupled with the abundance of diverse real-world network data, has heralded a new era in complex network science research. This survey aims to systematically address the potential advantages of AI in overcoming the lingering challenges of complex network research. It endeavors to summarize the pivotal research problems and provide an exhaustive review of the corresponding methodologies and applications. Through this comprehensive survey-the first of its kind on AI for complex networks-we expect to provide valuable insights that will drive further research and advancement in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>BTS: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Tie Strength Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19214v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid rise of online social networks underscores the need to understand the heterogeneous strengths of online relationships. Yet, efforts to assess tie strength (TS) are hindered by the lack of ground-truth labels, differing research perspectives, and limited model performance in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce BTS, a comprehensive Benchmark for Tie Strength prediction, aiming to establish a standardized foundation for evaluating and advancing TS prediction methodologies. Specifically, our contributions are: TS Pseudo-Label Techniques -- we categorize TS into seven standardized pseudo-labeling techniques based on prior literature; TS Dataset Collection -- we present a representative collection of three social networks and perform data analysis by investigating the class distributions and correlations across the generated pseudo-labels; TS Pseudo-Label Evaluation Framework -- we propose a standardized framework to evaluate the pseudo-label quality from the perspective of tie resilience; Benchmarking -- we evaluate existing tie strength prediction model performance using the BTS dataset collection, exploring the effects of different experiment settings, models, and evaluation criteria on the results. Furthermore, we derive key insights to enhance existing methods and shed light on promising directions for future research in this domain. The BTS dataset collection, along with the curation codes and experimental scripts, is all available at: https://github.com/XueqiC/Awesome-Tie-Strength-Prediction.</description>

      <title>Two-step dimensionality reduction of human mobility data: From potential landscapes to spatiotemporal insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Homophily-Driven Sanitation View for Robust Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate adversarial robustness of unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) against structural attacks. First, we provide a comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis of existing attacks, revealing how and why they downgrade the performance of GCL. Inspired by our analytic results, we present a robust GCL framework that integrates a homophily-driven sanitation view, which can be learned jointly with contrastive learning. A key challenge this poses, however, is the non-differentiable nature of the sanitation objective. To address this challenge, we propose a series of techniques to enable gradient-based end-to-end robust GCL. Moreover, we develop a fully unsupervised hyperparameter tuning method which, unlike prior approaches, does not require knowledge of node labels. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed model, GCHS (Graph Contrastive Learning with Homophily-driven Sanitation View), against two state of the art structural attacks on GCL. Our results demonstrate that GCHS consistently outperforms all state of the art baselines in terms of the quality of generated node embeddings as well as performance on two important downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>GNNAnatomy: Rethinking Model-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve outstanding performance across graph-based tasks but remain difficult to interpret. In this paper, we revisit foundational assumptions underlying model-level explanation methods for GNNs, namely: (1) maximizing classification confidence yields representative explanations, (2) a single explanation suffices for an entire class of graphs, and (3) explanations are inherently trustworthy. We identify pitfalls resulting from these assumptions: methods that optimize for classification confidence may overlook partially learned patterns; topological diversity across graph subsets within the same class is often underrepresented; and explanations alone offer limited support for building user trust when applied to new datasets or models. This paper introduces GNNAnatomy, a distillation-based method designed to generate explanations while avoiding these pitfalls. GNNAnatomy first characterizes graph topology using graphlets, a set of fundamental substructures. We then train a transparent multilayer perceptron surrogate to directly approximate GNN predictions based on the graphlet representations. By analyzing the weights assigned to each graphlet, we identify the most discriminative topologies, which serve as GNN explanations. To account for structural diversity within a class, GNNAnatomy generates explanations at the required granularity through an interface that supports human-AI teaming. This interface helps users identify subsets of graphs where distinct critical substructures drive class differentiation, enabling multi-grained explanations. Additionally, by enabling exploration and linking explanations back to input graphs, the interface fosters greater transparency and trust. We evaluate GNNAnatomy on both synthetic and real-world datasets through quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art model-level explainable GNN methods.</description>

Abstract: Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, heavily relies on node features. However, many real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, lack node features due to privacy concerns, incomplete data, or collection limitations. Structural and positional encoding are commonly used to address this but are constrained by the maximum values of the encoded properties, such as the highest node degree. This limitation makes them impractical for scale-free networks and applications involving large or non-categorical properties. This paper introduces PropEnc, a novel and versatile encoder to generate expressive node embedding from any graph metric. By combining histogram construction with reversed index encoding, PropEnc offers a flexible solution that supports low-dimensional representations and diverse input types, effectively mitigating sparsity issues while improving computational efficiency. Additionally, it replicates one-hot encoding or approximates indices with high accuracy, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph applications. We validate PropEnc through extensive experiments on graph classification task across several social networks lacking node features. The empirical results demonstrate that PropEnc offers an efficient mechanism for constructing node features from various graph metrics.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>

Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, for many applications, it is important to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Selective Response Strategies for GenAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has significantly impacted human-based forums like Stack Overflow, which are essential for generating high-quality data. This creates a negative feedback loop, hindering the development of GenAI systems, which rely on such data to provide accurate responses. In this paper, we provide a possible remedy: A novel strategy we call selective response. Selective response implies that GenAI could strategically provide inaccurate (or conservative) responses to queries involving emerging topics and novel technologies, thereby driving users to use human-based forums like Stack Overflow. We show that selective response can potentially have a compounding effect on the data generation process, increasing both GenAI's revenue and user welfare in the long term. From an algorithmic perspective, we propose an approximately optimal approach to maximize GenAI's revenue under social welfare constraints. From a regulatory perspective, we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for selective response to improve welfare improvements.</description>

      <title>Counter-Inferential Behavior in Natural and Artificial Cognitive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance, meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition, human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under informational stress.</description>
