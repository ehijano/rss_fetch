      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP). Part 1: Establishing a Baseline Climatology for Severe Weather across the Philippine Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the rudimentary reporting methods and general lack of documentation, the creation of a severe weather database within the Philippines has been difficult yet relevant target for climatology purposes and historical interest. Previous online severe weather documentation i.e. of tornadoes, waterspouts, and hail events, has also often been few, inconsistent, or is now defunct. Many individual countries or continents maintain severe weather information through either government-sponsored or independent organizations. In this case, Project SWAP is intended to be a collaborative exercise, with clear data attribution and open avenues for augmentation, and the creation of a common data model to store the severe weather event information will assist in maintaining and updating the database in the Philippines. For this work, we document the methods necessary for creating the SWAP database, provide broader climatological analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in severe weather occurrence within the Philippine context, and outline potential use cases for the data. We also highlight its key limitations, and emphasize the need for further standardization of such documentation.</description>

      <title>The role of energetic flow structures on the aeolian transport of sediment and plastic debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in conceptually describing the dynamic aspects of coarse particle entrainment, which has been explored experimentally for open channel flows. The aim of this study is to extend the application of energy criterion to the low mobility aeolian transport of solids (including both natural sediment and anthropogenic debris such as plastics), ranging from incomplete (rocking) to full (rolling) entrainments. This is achieved by linking particle movements to energetic flow events, which are defined as flow structures with the ability to work on particles, setting them into motion. It is hypothesized that such events should impart sufficient energy to the particles, above a certain threshold value. The concept's validity is demonstrated experimentally, using a wind tunnel and laser distance sensor (LDS) to capture the dynamics of an individual target particle, exposed on a rough bed surface. Measurements are acquired at a high spatiotemporal resolution, and synchronously with the instantaneous air velocity at an appropriate distance upwind of the target particle, using a hot film anemometer. This enables the association of flow events with rocking and rolling entrainments. Furthermore, it is shown that rocking and rolling may have distinct energy thresholds. Estimates of the energy transfer efficiency, normalized by the drag coefficient, range over an order of magnitude (from about 0.001 to 0.0048 for rocking, up to about 0.01, for incipient rolling). The proposed event-based theoretical framework is a novel approach to characterizing the energy imparted from the wind to the soil surface and could have potential implications for modelling intermittent creep transport of coarse particles and related aeolian bedforms.</description>

      <title>What if? Numerical weather prediction at the crossroads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an outlook on the future of operational weather prediction given the recent evolution in science, computing and machine learning. In many parts, this evolution strongly deviates from the strategy operational centres have formulated only several years ago. New opportunities in digital technology have greatly accelerated progress, and the full integration of computational science in numerical weather prediction centres is common knowledge now. Within the last few years, a vast machine learning research community has emerged for creating new and tailor-made products, accelerating processing and - most of all - creating emulators for the entire production of global forecasts that outperform traditional systems at the spatial resolution of the training data. In this context, the role of both numerical models and observations is changing from being equation to data driven. Analyses and reanalyses are becoming the new currency for training machine learning, and operational centres are in a powerful position as they generate these datasets based on decades worth of experience. This environment creates incredible opportunities to progress much faster than in the past but also uncertainties about what the strategic implications on defining cost-effective and sustainable research and operations are, and how to achieve sufficient high-performance computing and data handling capacities. It will take individual national public services a while to understand what to focus on and how to coordinate their substantial investments in staff and infrastructure at institutional, national and international level. This paper addresses this new situation operational weather prediction finds itself in through formulating the most likely "what if?" scenarios for the near future and provides an outline for how weather centres could adapt.</description>

      <title>OceanNet: A principled neural operator-based digital twin for regional oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data-driven approaches demonstrate great potential in atmospheric modeling and weather forecasting, ocean modeling poses distinct challenges due to complex bathymetry, land, vertical structure, and flow non-linearity. This study introduces OceanNet, a principled neural operator-based digital twin for ocean circulation. OceanNet uses a Fourier neural operator and predictor-evaluate-corrector integration scheme to mitigate autoregressive error growth and enhance stability over extended time scales. A spectral regularizer counteracts spectral bias at smaller scales. OceanNet is applied to the northwest Atlantic Ocean western boundary current (the Gulf Stream), focusing on the task of seasonal prediction for Loop Current eddies and the Gulf Stream meander. Trained using historical sea surface height (SSH) data, OceanNet demonstrates competitive forecast skill by outperforming SSH predictions by an uncoupled, state-of-the-art dynamical ocean model forecast, reducing computation by 500,000 times. These accomplishments demonstrate the potential of physics-inspired deep neural operators as cost-effective alternatives to high-resolution numerical ocean models.</description>
