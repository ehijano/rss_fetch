      <title>Discrete Symmetries in the Chiral Fermion Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a revision of the discrete symmetries (C, P, T, CP, and CPT) within an approach that treats 2-component Weyl spinors as the fundamental building blocks. In particular, we show that we can define transformations for CP, T, and CPT without exchanging the right-handed and left-handed representative components that form a Dirac spinor, as is done in the traditional Dirac formalism. Then, we discuss some salient aspects of the discrete symmetries within quantum field theory (QFT). Besides the generic discussion, we also consider aspects arising within specific renormalizable theories, such as Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Yang-Mills (YM) theory. With the above, in addition to presenting a good introduction for non-experts, we establish how to use the chiral fermion formalism to study discrete symmetries in the context of QFT.</description>

      <title>(Quadratically) Refined Discrete Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the cancellation of non-perturbative anomalies of gravitational theories with gauge group $\mathbb{Z}_k$ in six dimensions. These subtle anomalies require a classification of deformation classes of manifolds with discrete gauge bundles known as bordism groups. The consistency of the theory demands a cancellation of the fermion anomalies, which can be done by the transformation properties of 2-form fields in the theory. Since the 2-forms in six dimensions are themselves chiral, their formulation needs subtle topological information encoded in a so-called quadratic refinement. A matching between the fermionic anomalies and the defining properties of the quadratic refinement, lead to strong consistency constraints on the charged fermion spectrum. We explicitly determine these consistency conditions for the case of a single chiral 2-form and various discrete gauge groups. Since we provide a model-independent formulation, these restrictions hold universally for theories of this type.</description>

      <title>Non-associative Algebras of Cubic Matrices and their Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by M-theory, we define a new type of non-associative algebra involving usual and cubic matrices at the same time. The resulting algebra can be regarded as a two-term truncated $L_\infty$ algebra giving rise to a fundamental identity between the two- and the three-bracket. We provide a simple class of concrete examples of such algebras based on the structure constants of a Lie algebra. Connecting to previous results on higher structures, we generalize the construction of Yang-Mills theories, topological BF theory and generalized IKKT models and point out some appearing issues.</description>

      <title>On Spinning Particles, their Partition Functions and Picture Changing Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the partition function for the $N=1$ spinning particle, including pictures and the large Hilbert space, and show that it counts the dimension of the BRST cohomology in two- and four-dimensional target space. We also construct a quadratic action in the target space. Furthermore, we find a consistent interaction as a derived bracket based on the associative product of world line fields, leading to an interacting theory of multiforms in space-time. Finally, we comment on the equivalence of the multiform theory with a Dirac fermion. We also identify the chiral anomaly of the latter with a Hodge anomaly for the multiform theory, which manifests itself as a deformation of the gauge fixing.</description>

      <title>Loop corrections to the four-fermion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ff to ff scattering amplitudes for the a massless four-fermion interaction model in four dimensions. The loop corrections up to the three-loop level are calculated within the spin-helicity formalism using the Weyl spinors. We find out that there are two independent spinor structures that appear in all orders of perturbation theory that can be separated when calculating the diagrams. Our aim is to calculate the leading divergences within the dimensional regularization. To check the validity of our calculations, we use the recurrence relations that connect the leading divergences in the subsequent orders of perturbation theory. We left the derivation of these relations and further analysis of the consequences for another publication for the sake of clarity of the current presentation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting noncommutative spacetimes from the relative locality principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic deformed kinematics leads to a loss of the absolute locality of interactions. In previous studies, some models of noncommutative spacetimes in a two-particle system that implements locality were considered. In this work, we present a characterization of the Poisson-Lie algebras formed by the noncommutative space-time coordinates of a multi-particle system and Lorentz generators as a possible restriction on these models. The relativistic deformed kinematics derived from these algebras are also discussed. Finally, we show its connection with cotangent bundle geometries.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of an almost-commutative spectral triple from a geometric construction on a configuration space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the structure of an almost-commutative spectral triple emerges in a semi-classical limit from a geometric construction on a configuration space of gauge connections. The geometric construction resembles that of a spectral triple with a Dirac operator on the configuration space that interacts with the so-called $\mathbf{HD}$-algebra, which is an algebra of operator-valued functions on the configuration space, and which is generated by parallel-transports along flows of vector-fields on the underlying manifold. In a semi-classical limit the $\mathbf{HD}$-algebra produces an almost-commutative algebra where the finite factor depends on the representation of the $\mathbf{HD}$-algebra and on the point in the configuration space over which the semi-classical state is localized. Interestingly, we find that the Hilbert space, in which the almost-commutative algebra acts, comes with a double fermionic structure that resembles the fermionic doubling found in the noncommutative formulation of the standard model. Finally, the emerging almost-commutative algebra interacts with a spatial Dirac operator that emerges in the semi-classical limit. This interaction involves both factors of the almost-commutative algebra.</description>

      <title>Tunneling with physics-informed RG flows in the anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the anharmonic oscillator with physics-informed renormalisation group (PIRG) flows, with an emphasis on the weak coupling regime with its instanton-dominated tunnelling processes. We show that the instanton physics behind the exponential decay of the energy gap is already covered in the first order of the derivative expansion of the PIRG. The crucial new ingredients in the present analysis are the use of the ground state expansion within PIRG flows, as well as precision numerics based on Galerkin methods. Our result $a_{\mathrm{inst}} = 1.910(2)$ for the decay constant is in quantitative agreement with the analytic one, $a_{\mathrm{inst}} = 1.886$ with a deviation of $1\%$. This illustrates very impressively the capacity of the PIRG for fully capturing non-perturbative physics already in relatively simple approximations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and local holography in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The It from Qubit paradigm proposes that gravitational spacetimes emerge from quantum entanglement. So far, the main evidence for this involves holographic dualities, where the entangled qubits live in a dual nongravitational theory. In this essay, we argue that string theory provides the mechanism to define these entangled qubits in the bulk gravitating theory. This involves a local form of geometric transition, which is the stringy mechanism that underlies \emph{local} holography. We illustrate how this works in the A model topological string,</description>

      <title>Higgsing Transitions from Topological Field Theory &amp; Non-Invertible Symmetry in Chern-Simons Matter Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invertible one-form symmetries are naturally realized in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. In this work, we consider the potential realization of such symmetries in (2+1)d conformal field theories, investigating whether gapless systems can exhibit similar symmetry structures. To that end, we discuss transitions between topological field theories in (2+1)d which are driven by the Higgs mechanism in Chern-Simons matter theories. Such transitions can be modeled mesoscopically by filling spacetime with a lattice-shaped domain wall network separating the two topological phases. Along the domain walls are coset conformal field theories describing gapless chiral modes trapped by a locally vanishing scalar mass. In this presentation, the one-form symmetries of the transition point can be deduced by using anyon condensation to track lines through the domain wall network. Using this framework, we discuss a variety of concrete examples of non-invertible one-form symmetry in fixed-point theories. For instance, $SU(k)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a scalar in the symmetric tensor representation produces a transition from an $SU(k)_{2}$ phase to an $SO(k)_{4}$ phase and has non-invertible one-form symmetry $PSU(2)_{-k}$ at the fixed point. We also discuss theories with $Spin(2N)$ and $E_{7}$ gauge groups manifesting other patterns of non-invertible one-form symmetry. In many of our examples, the non-invertible one-form symmetry is not a modular invariant TQFT on its own and thus is an intrinsic part of the fixed-point dynamics.</description>

      <title>An optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</description>

      <title>No Dark Matter Axion During Minimal Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimal versions of Higgs inflation in the presence of a massless QCD axion. While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>Input to European Strategy Update for Particle Physics: Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human activity continues to have an enormous negative impact on the ability of the planet to sustain human and other forms of life. Six out of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed, a seventh is close to threshold. Prominent manifestations of this development are climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, as well as loss of biodiversity. In recognition of the urgency of these problems, several international agreements have been ratified to achieve net-zero emissions and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Significant reductions in emissions are required by 2030 to meet international climate targets. The field of particle physics has an obligation and an opportunity to contribute to such mitigation efforts and to avoid causing further harm. This document urges the European Strategy Update in Particle Physics to set a clear and bold mandate for embedding environmental sustainability throughout the future scientific programme, and advocates for a series of actions that will enable this.</description>

      <title>Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments: observational signatures and parameter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential conflict between the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) poses a significant challenge in general relativity. The WCCC serves as a fundamental assumption ensuring the coherence of gravitational theory. This study investigates the reconciliation of the WGC and the WCCC by examining Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes in four-dimensional spacetime. By imposing specific constraints on the metric parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and the WCCC can coexist harmoniously. Detailed analyses of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes for \( Q &gt; M \) validate the simultaneous fulfillment of the two conjectures, particularly in scenarios where \( q^2/m^2 \geq \left(Q^2 / M^2\right)_{\text{e}} \). The electromagnetic self-interaction parameter \( \mu \) plays a crucial role in achieving this compatibility. Our findings establish that Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes provide a robust framework for harmonizing the WGC and the WCCC. In particular, for exceedingly small values of ($\mu$)-or, equivalently, when the condition ($\mu \ll \ell$) is satisfied-the structure of our black hole transitions in a way that distinctly reveals its compatibility with the WGC. This study also explores the compatibility of the WGC and the WCCC with photon spheres. It examines parameter spaces that satisfy both conjectures, ensuring event horizons and photon spheres while maintaining black hole properties. Key results demonstrate that small \( \mu \) values preserve WCCC adherence and validate WGC through photon sphere characteristics.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropic dark energy with spatial curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of thermodynamics of apparent horizon, we construct a dark energy (DE) model from 4-parameter generalized entropy of apparent horizon in a spatially non-flat universe. In particular, considering a non-zero spatial curvature of the universe, we determine the dark energy fractional density and the dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter (corresponding to the 4-parameter generalized entropy) in closed analytic forms. It turns out that the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of the present Hubble parameter for a certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to a possible resolution of the Hubble tension issue. This in turn leads to a positive spatial curvature of the universe. We confront the scenario with CC \&amp; BAO, Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES and joint analysis of the CC \&amp; BAO \&amp; Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES datasets, which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent with the resolution of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis from cosmological CP breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that baryogenesis can arise from the cosmological evolution of a scalar field that governs CP-violating parameters, such as the Yukawa couplings and the theta terms of the Standard Model. During the big bang, this scalar may reach a CP-violating minimum, where its mass can be comparable to the inflationary Hubble scale. Such dynamics can emerge in theories featuring either a spontaneously broken local U(1) symmetry or modular invariance. The latter arises naturally as the effective field theory capturing the geometric origin of CP violation in toroidal string compactifications. Modular baryogenesis is compatible with the modular approach to resolving the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects in False Vacuum Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

Abstract: We constructed all possible kinematically allowed three-point interactions of two massless Dirac spinors with massive higher-spin bosons. In any $D$ spacetime, the interactions have been constructed using the projections of the higher spin irreducible representations of $Spin(D-1)$ over the product of two irreducible spinor representations of $Spin(D-2)$. Based on this analysis, we have further classified the space of theories involving two massless Dirac spinors and a single (or multiple) massive higher spin(s) based on the discrete symmetries: $C,\, R,$ and $ T$. We found that in any $D=2m+1/2m$, the interacting theories of a single massive higher spin have a \enquote{$m$} mod $2$ (or $D$ mod $4$) classification.</description>

Abstract: We study the resurgent structures of Wilson loops in refined topological string theory. We argue that the Borel singularities should be integral periods, and that the associated Stokes constants are refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants, just like the free energies, except that the Borel singularities cannot be local flat coordinates. We also solve the non-perturbative series in closed form from the holomorphic anomaly equations for the refined Wilson loops. We illustrate these results with the examples of local P^2 and local P^1 x P^1.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loops with Lagrangians: Large Spin OPE and Cusp Anomalous Dimension Dictionary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of planar conformal gauge theory, we study five-point correlation functions between the interaction Lagrangian and four of the lightest single-trace, gauge-invariant scalar primaries. After performing two light-cone OPEs, we express this correlator in terms of the three-point functions between two leading-twist spinning operators and the Lagrangian. For finite values of spin, we compute these structure constants in perturbation theory up to two loops in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Large values of spin are captured by null polygon kinematics, where we use dualities with null polygon Wilson loops as well as factorization properties to bootstrap the universal behavior of the structure constants at all loops. We find explicit maps that relate the Lagrangian structure constants with the leading-twist anomalous dimension. From the large-spin map, we recover the cusp anomalous dimension at strong and weak coupling, including genus-one terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The corrections to the tree-level effective action for the bosonic string up to second order in $\alpha'$ are fixed by requiring its dimensional reduction to $26-d$ dimensions to be compatible with $O(d,d)$ symmetry. The result is in agreement with the literature, but takes a simpler form than previously know expressions. We identify some structures in the Lagrangian which appear at least at the first three orders in $\alpha'$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: Generalized $\phi^{2n+1}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n&gt;1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.</description>

      <title>Practical Introduction to Action-Dependent Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action-dependent field theories are systems where the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian depends on new variables that encode the action. They model a larger class of field theories, including non-conservative behavior, while maintaining a well-defined notion of symmetries and a Noether theorem. This makes them especially suited for open systems. After a conceptual introduction, we make a quick presentation of a new mathematical framework for action-dependent field theory: multicontact geometry. The formalism is illustrated with a variety of action-dependent Lagrangians, some of which are regular and others singular, derived from well-known theories whose Lagrangians have been modified to incorporate action-dependent terms. Detailed computations are provided, including the constraint algorithm for the singular cases, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. These are the one-dimensional wave equation, the Klein-Gordon equation and the telegrapher equation, Maxwell's electromagnetism, Metric-affine gravity, the heat equation and Burguers' equation, the Bosonic string theory, and (2+1)-dimensional gravity and Chern-Simons equation.</description>

      <title>IR finite correlation functions in de Sitter space, a smooth massless limit, and an autonomous equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation function up to the $\lambda^3$ order and the four-point correlation function up to the $\lambda^2$ one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part. Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one. Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach, and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant $\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} &lt; \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence where both bulk and boundary theories are tractable are hard to come by, but the minimal tension string on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ is one notable example. In this paper, we discuss how one can construct sigma models on twistor space, with a particular focus on applying these techniques to the aforementioned string theory. We derive novel incidence relations, which allow us to understand to what extent the minimal tension string encodes information about the bulk. We identify vertex operators in terms of bulk twistor variables and a map from twistor space to spacetime is presented. We also demonstrate the presence of a partially broken global supersymmetry algebra in the minimal tension string and we argue that this implies that there exists an $\mathcal{N} = 2$ formulation of the theory. The implications of this are studied and we demonstrate the presence of an additional constraint on physical states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When reduced from $10$ to $10-d$ dimensions tree-level string theory exhibits an $O(d,d)$ symmetry. This symmetry, which is closely related to T-duality, appears only after certain field redefinitions. We find a simple form for a subset of these redefinitions at order $\alpha'^3$ and show that they cannot be lifted to ten dimensions. This is inconsistent with ``manifestly T-duality invariant'' approaches such as generalized geometry (in the uncompactified setting). Such formulations therefore seem not to be the correct language to describe string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review 2d CFT in the bootstrap approach, and sketch the known exactly solvable CFTs with no extended chiral symmetry: Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, limits thereof, and loop CFTs, including the $O(n)$, Potts and $PSU(n)$ CFTs.
  Exact solvability relies on local conformal symmetry, and on the existence of degenerate fields. We show how these assumptions constrain the spectrum and correlation functions. We discuss how crossing symmetry equations can be solved analytically and/or numerically, leading to analytic expressions for structure constants in terms of the double Gamma function.
  In the case of loop CFTs, we sketch the corresponding statistical models, and derive the relation between statistical and CFT variables. We review the resulting combinatorial description of correlation functions, and discuss what remains to be done for solving the CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local Lie algebra of the Standard Model (SM) is $su(3)\times su(2) \times u(1)$, yet its global gauge group, $G_{{\rm SM}_{\rm q}}=$SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1)/$\mathbb{Z}_{\rm q}$, q$=1,2,3,6$ remains undetermined. Building on previous work on 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants, we classify lower-dimensional invertible field theories (iFTs) or symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the integer SPTs are hard to detect, the fractional SPTs produce measurable topological responses. In particular, the symmetry fractionalization labeled by $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{6/{\rm q}}$ in [arXiv:2411.18160] introduces the symmetry-enriched SM variants, denoted as SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. We further introduce a new integer $n$ series of baryon-minus-lepton $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$-like U(1) symmetries, $X_n \equiv n (\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}) + (1-\frac{n}{N_c})\tilde{Y}$ with electroweak hypercharge $\tilde{Y}$, $n\ge1$, $N_c=3$, where the charge $q_{X_n} = q_{\tilde{Y}} \mod n$. Analyzing the symmetry-enriched SM with 0-form and 1-form symmetries $(G_{[0]}, G_{[1]})$, symmetry-twist group homomorphism $\rho$, and symmetry frationalization obstruction $[\beta]$, their spacetime-internal gauge bundle constraints, and their mixed anomalies, we derive the fractional topological response $\sigma_n({\rm q},k)=\frac{{\rm q}(1-n)\gcd(2,n)}{2n}+\frac{k{\rm q}}{6}\mod1.$ Our $\sigma_n$ response requires more general Spin$^c$ manifolds for odd $n$ and Spin manifolds for even $n$. For a given $n$ (with $n\ge 7$ and $n\ne 10,12,15,30$), $\sigma_n$ uniquely fixes the gauge group parameter q and fractionalization label $k$. Moreover, using pairs such as $(n_1,n_2)=(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)$, etc. uniquely distinguishes SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. Our results illuminate the global structure of the SM gauge group via measurable topological responses.</description>

      <title>Finite group gauge theory on graphs and gravity-like modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gauge theory with finite group $G$ on a graph $X$ using noncommutative differential geometry and Hopf algebra methods with $G$-valued holonomies replaced by gauge fields valued in a `finite group Lie algebra' subset of the group algebra $\mathbb{C} G$ corresponding to the complete graph differential structure on $G$. We show that this richer theory decomposes as a product over the nontrivial irreducible representations $\rho$ with dimension $d_\rho$ of certain noncommutative $U(d_\rho)$-Yang-Mills theories, which we introduce. The Yang-Mills action recovers the Wilson action for a lattice but now with additional terms. We compute the moduli space $\mathcal{A}^\times / \mathcal{G}$ of regular connections modulo gauge transformations on connected graphs $X$. For $G$ Abelian, this is given as expected by phases associated to fundamental loops but with additional $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued modes on every edge resembling the metric for quantum gravity models on graphs. For nonAbelian $G$, these modes become positive-matrix valued modes. We study the quantum gauge field theory in the Abelian case in a functional integral approach, particularly for $X$ the finite chain $A_{n+1}$, the $n$-gon $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the single plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We show that, in stark contrast to usual lattice gauge theory, the Lorentzian version is well-behaved, and we identify novel boundary vs bulk effects in the case of the finite chain. We also consider gauge fields valued in the finite-group Lie algebra corresponding to a general Cayley graph differential calculus on $G$, where we study an obstruction to closure of gauge transformations.</description>

Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.09566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a higher-categorical generalization of the "Karoubi envelope" construction from ordinary category theory, and prove that, like the ordinary Karoubi envelope, our higher Karoubi envelope is the closure for absolute limits. Our construction replaces the idempotents in the ordinary version with a notion that we call "condensations." The name is justified by the direct physical interpretation of the notion of condensation: it encodes a general class of constructions which produce a new topological phase of matter by turning on a commuting projector Hamiltonian on a lattice of defects within a different topological phase, which may be the trivial phase. We also identify our higher Karoubi envelopes with categories of fully-dualizable objects. Together with the Cobordism Hypothesis, we argue that this realizes an equivalence between a very broad class of gapped topological phases of matter and fully extended topological field theories, in any number of dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Symbol letters are crucial for analytically calculating Feynman integrals in terms of iterated integrals. We present a novel method to construct the symbol letters for a given integral family without prior knowledge of the canonical differential equations. We provide a program package implementing our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving non-trivial problems with multiple loops and legs. Using our method, we successfully bootstrap the canonical differential equations for a two-loop five-point family with two external masses and for a three-loop four-point family with two external masses, which were previously unknown in the literature. We anticipate that our method can be applied to a wide range of cutting-edge calculations in the future.</description>

Abstract: We present a covariant description of non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes in $f(R)$ gravity applying the (1+1+2) covariant formalism. The propagation equations are then used to derive a covariant and dimensionless form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. We then give a solution strategy to these equations and obtain some new exact solutions for the particular case $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$, which have the correct thermodynamic properties for standard matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an analytic result for the EH following a quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models, valid in the ballistic scaling regime. The derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to operators, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The path integral approach to a quantum theory of gravity is widely regarded as an indispensable strategy. However, determining what additional elements, beyond black hole or AdS spacetime, should be incorporated into the path integral remains crucial yet perplexing. We argue that the spacetime with a conical singularity in its Euclidean counterpart should be the most important ingredient to append to the path integral. Therefore, physical quantities should be ensemble-averaged over all geometries since they are described by the same Lorentzian metric. When the ensemble average is introduced, the Hawking-Page transition for the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole and the small-large black hole transition for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole naturally arise as semi-classical approximations, when the size of the black hole system is much larger than the Planck length. Away from the semi-classical limit, the system is a superposition of different geometries, and the averaged quantities would deviate from the black hole thermodynamics. Expanding around the classical saddles, the subleading order of the Newton constant contributions can be derived, which are half of the Hawking temperature both for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes. The result may imply a universal structure. The subsubleading terms and more intriguing physics that diverge from black hole thermodynamics are revealed. The ensemble-averaged theory provides a new way of studying subleading effects and extending the traditional AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study an Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS)-like gravitational collapse in the general framework of scale-dependent gravity. We explore the collapse in spherically symmetric solutions suggested both by asymptotically safe gravity (characterized by a positive $\om$-parameter) and by scale-dependent gravity (negative $\om$-parameter), when a singularity at a finite positive radial coordinate is developed. The inner geometry of the collapsing star is described, as usual, by a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, and matter is uniformly distributed without any assumptions about its equation of state. The outer asymptotically-safe/scale-dependent black hole metric is smoothly matched to the inner geometry, and this yields the equation of motion of the star surface, the energy density, pressure, and equation of state of the collapsing matter. We study in detail the proper-time evolution of the event and apparent horizons. Finally, the constraints of the energy conditions on the equation of state, and its properties, are considered and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum no-cloning is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum information. In this work, we introduce a new toolkit for analyzing cloning games; these games capture more quantitative versions of no-cloning and are central to unclonable cryptography. Previous works rely on the framework laid out by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski and Wehner to analyze both the $n$-qubit BB84 game and the subspace coset game. Their constructions and analysis face the following inherent limitations:
  - The existing bounds on the values of these games are at least $2^{-0.25n}$; on the other hand, the trivial adversarial strategy wins with probability $2^{-n}$. Not only that, the BB84 game does in fact admit a highly nontrivial winning strategy. This raises the natural question: are there cloning games which admit no non-trivial winning strategies?
  - The existing constructions are not multi-copy secure; the BB84 game is not even $2 \mapsto 3$ secure, and the subspace coset game is not $t \mapsto t+1$ secure for a polynomially large $t$. Moreover, we provide evidence that the existing technical tools do not suffice to prove multi-copy security of even completely different constructions. This raises the natural question: can we design new cloning games that achieve multi-copy security, possibly by developing a new analytic toolkit?
  We study a new cloning game based on binary phase states and show that it is $t$-copy secure when $t=o(n/\log n)$. Moreover, for constant $t$, we obtain the first asymptotically optimal bounds of $O(2^{-n})$. We also show a worst-case to average-case reduction for a large class of cloning games, which allows us to show the same quantitative results for Haar cloning games. These technical ingredients together enable two new applications which have previously been out of reach; one in black hole physics, and one in unclonable cryptography.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of a four-fermion model with $CP$ violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a functional renormalization group analysis of a four-fermion model with $CP$ and $P$ violation to explore the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) within the Wilsonian renormalization group framework, particularly in the context of spontaneous $CP$-violation models. Our analysis of the fixed-point structure reveals that, in the large-$N_c$ limit, the $CP$-violating $\bar{\theta}$ parameter is dynamically induced and approaches $\pi \cdot (N_f/2)$ (where $N_f$ is the number of flavors) as the system enters the chirally broken phase. This behavior arises due to criticality and the large anomalous dimensions of the $U(1)_A$-violating four-fermion couplings. Furthermore, this trend appears to persist beyond the leading large-$N_c$ approximation, provided that the infrared dynamics of QCD remains dominated by the scalar condensate of the quark bilinear, as expected. Notably, our findings highlight that $CP$-violating four-fermion interactions, which are perturbatively irrelevant, can become relevant in the chirally broken phase through nonperturbative effects, with potential implications for spontaneous $CP$-violation scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We analyze existence and properties of solutions of two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets with a negative cosmological constant, both on spacelike and characteristic surfaces. A new family of such vacuum, spacelike data parameterised by poles at the conformal boundary at infinity is constructed. We review the notions of global Hamiltonian charges, emphasising the difficulties arising in this dimension, both in a spacelike and characteristic setting. One or two, depending upon the topology, lower bounds for energy in terms of angular momentum, linear momentum, and center of mass are established.</description>

Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened primordial black holes on high-scale leptogenesis</title>

Abstract: We explore the impact of the back-reaction of evaporation on the quantum state of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), known as ``memory burden", on the baryon asymmetry production in the Universe through high-scale leptogenesis. Focusing on PBH masses ranging from 1 to 1000 grams, we investigate the interplay between the non-thermal production of heavy sterile neutrinos and the entropy injection within this non-standard cosmological framework. By assuming appropriate values for the memory-burden parameters, $q=1/2$ and $k=1$, we derive mutual exclusion limits between PBHs and thermal leptogenesis in the mixed parameter space. Our analysis reveals that the primary contribution of PBHs to baryon asymmetry stems from entropy injection. Indeed, we find that, differently from earlier studies based on the semi-classical Hawking evaporation, the memory-burden effect suppresses the non-thermal source term in the PBH mass range explored. This has significant implications for understanding baryogenesis in such alternative cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>
