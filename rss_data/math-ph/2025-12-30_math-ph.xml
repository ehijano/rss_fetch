      <title>Inverse scattering for waveguides in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse scattering problem of a topologically non-trivial waveguide separating two-dimensional topological insulators. We consider the specific model of a Dirac system. We show that a short-range perturbation can be fully reconstructed from scattering data in a linearized setting and in a finite-dimensional setting under a smallness constraint. We also provide a stability result in appropriate topologies. We then solve the problem numerically by means of a standard adjoint method and illustrate our theoretical findings with several numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Six Vertex model and discrete Orthogonal Polynomial ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit remarkable fluctuation phenomena. While a variety of powerful methods have led to a detailed understanding of their typical fluctuations or large deviations, much less is known about behavior on intermediate, or moderate deviation, scales. Addressing this problem requires refined asymptotic control of the integrable structures underlying KPZ models.
  Motivated by this perspective, we study multiplicative statistics of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles (dOPEs) in different scaling regimes, with a particular focus on applications to tail probabilities of the height function in the stochastic six-vertex model. For a large class of dOPEs, we obtain robust singular asymptotic estimates for multiplicative statistics critically scaled near a saturated-to-band transition. These asymptotics exhibit universal crossover behavior, interpolating between Airy, Painlev\'e XXXIV, and Bessel-type regimes. Our proofs employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP) approach to obtain asymptotics for the correlation kernel of a deformed version of the dOPE across the critical scaling windows. These asymptotics are then used on a double integral formula relating this kernel to partition function ratios, which may be of independent interest. At the technical level, the RHP analysis requires a novel parameter-dependent local parametrix, which needs a separate asymptotic analysis of its own.
  Using these results, together with a known identity relating a Laplace-type transform of the stochastic six-vertex model height function to a multiplicative statistic of the Meixner point process, we derive moderate deviation estimates for the height function in both the upper and lower tail regimes, with sharp exponents and constants.</description>

      <title>Field Theory via Higher Geometry II: Thickened Smooth Sets as Synthetic Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers that aim to develop rigorous and most encompassing foundations for field theory, where in the first installment, we laid out the natural formulation of bosonic variational field theory via the functorial geometry of smooth sets. Here, we extend this to the category ThickenedSmoothSets of infinitesimally thickened smooth sets. We first describe the Cahiers topos in a simplified, but fully rigorous, $\mathbb{R}$-algebraic setting -- which should serve as a more accessible introduction to the theory of Synthetic Differential Geometry to both physicists and mathematicians. Then, we formulate local Lagrangian field theory in this rigorous setting in which infinitesimal spaces exist and interact correctly with the field-theoretic spaces of infinite jet bundles, off-shell and on-shell spaces of fields etc.
  This setting subsumes all previous constructions and further recovers all the relevant tangent bundles of traditional (off-shell and on-shell) field theory considerations via the synthetic tangent bundle construction, i.e., as ``infinitesimal curves'' in those spaces, which were previously defined only in an ad-hoc manner. Beyond finally establishing a firm foundation for such aspects of the theory, this approach recognizes the variational principle of local Lagrangian field theory, equivalently, as the intersection of thickened smooth sets. It also suggests the rigorous formalization of perturbative field theory as the restriction to a (synthetic) infinitesimal neighborhood around a field configuration. Furthermore, our context naturally accommodates more general, rigorous considerations, in which the manifolds may have boundaries and corners, a situation that has recently been attracting greater attention in the field-theoretical literature.</description>

      <title>Non-SUSY physics and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atiyah-Singer index theorem, a cornerstone of modern mathematics, has traditionally been derived from supersymmetric (SUSY) physics. This paper demonstrates a direct derivation from non-supersymmetric quantum statistics by establishing a fundamental correspondence: the grand partition functions of non-interacting bosonic and fermionic systems are precisely the Chern characters of certain vector bundles. Furthermore, we generalize this correspondence to infinite dimensions, where we construct a novel mathematical framework of spectral-sheaf pairs. Within this framework, we formulate a generalized index theorem, identifying the topological index with a regularized spectral product. This work not only circumvents the need for supersymmetry but also provides a deeper unifying perspective, revealing quantum statistics as a sufficient foundation for topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Gauge theories and Many-Body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures discuss two correspondences between gauge theories and integrable many-body systems. The first correspondence goes back to the work of many mathematicians and physicists in the 1980-1990's. It is realized by an infinite dimensional Hamiltonian reduction and its quantum counterpart. In this approach the quantization parameters of the gauge theory coincide with the quantization parameters of the many-body system. The second correspondence emerged in the mid-1990's, it involves non-trivial dualities, relating classical problems on one side to quantum on another and vice versa. This duality has various reincarnations: Fourier and Legendre transforms, Langlands duality, etc. The quantization parameters are mapped to geometric parameters. Simple questions on one side solve complicated ones on the other and vice versa.</description>

      <title>On construction of differential $\mathbb Z$-graded varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a commutative unital algebra $\mathcal O$, a proper ideal $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal O$, and a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O/\mathcal I$, we provide a $\mathbb Z$-graded extension, whose negative part is an arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of $\mathcal O/ \mathcal I$. This extension is obtained through an algorithm exploiting the explicit homotopy retract data of the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution, so that the number of homological computations in the construction is significantly reduced. For a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O$ that preserves the ideal $\mathcal I$, the extension admits a manifest description in terms of decorated trees and computed data.
  As a by-product, to every Lie--Rinehart algebra over the coordinate ring of an affine variety $ W \subseteq M = \mathbb{C}^d $, one associates an explicit differential $\mathbb{Z}$-graded variety over $M$ whose negative component is the arborescent Koszul--Tate resolution of the coordinate ring $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_d]/\mathcal I_W$ of $W$, and whose positive component is the universal dg-variety of the given Lie--Rinehart algebra. Concrete examples are given.</description>

      <title>The five-vertex model as a discrete log-gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the five-vertex model on a rectangular domain of the square lattice, with the so-called `scalar-product' boundary conditions. We address the evaluation of the free-energy density of the model in the scaling limit, that is when the number of sites is sent to infinity and the mesh of the lattice to zero, while keeping the size of the domain constant. To this aim, we reformulate the partition function of the model in terms of a discrete log-gas, and study its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit. We reproduce previous results, obtained by using a differential equation approach. Moreover, we provide the explicit form of the resolvent in all possible regimes. This work is preliminary to further studies of limit shape phenomena in the model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dilogarithms and New Integrable Lattice Models in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new class of integrable 3D lattice models, possessing continuous families of commuting layer-to-layer transfer matrices. Algebraically, this commutativity is based on a very special construction of local Boltzmann weights in terms of quantum dilogarithms satisfying the inversion and pentagon identities. We give three examples of such quantum dilogarithms, leading to integrable 3D lattice models. The partition function per site in these models can be exactly calculated in the limit of an infinite lattice by using the functional relations, symmetry and factorization properties of the transfer matrix. The results of such calculations for 3D models associated with the Faddeev modular quantum dilogarithm are briefly presented.</description>

      <title>A nonconservative kinetic framework with logistic growth for modeling the coexistence in a multi-species ecological system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic theory frameworks are widely used for modeling stochastic interacting systems, where the evolution primarily depends on binary interactions. Recently, in this framework the action of the external force field has been introduction in order to gain a more realistic picture of some phenomena. In this paper, we introduce nonconservative kinetic equations where a particular shape external force field acts on the overall system. Then, this framework is used in an ecological context for modeling the evolution of a system composed of two species interacting with a prey-predator mechanism. The linear stability analysis concerned with the coexistence equilibrium point is provided, and a case where a Hopf bifurcations occurs is discussed. Finally, some relevant scenarios are numerically simulated.</description>

      <title>Representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals. Crystal symmetries are usually described as the finite symmetry group of a finite crystal with periodic boundary conditions, for which the Brillouin zone is a finite set of points. However, to deal with the continuous crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$ required to discuss the continuity, singularity or analyticity of band energies $\epsilon_n(\mathbf{k})$ and Bloch states $\psi_{\mathbf{k}}$, we need to consider infinite crystals. The symmetry groups of infinite crystals belong to the category of infinite non-compact groups, for which many standard tools of group theory break down. For example, character theory is no longer available for these groups and we use harmonic analysis to build the group algebra, the regular representation, the induction of irreducible representations of the crystallographic group from projective representations of the point groups and the decomposition of a representation into its irreducible parts. We deal with magnetic and non-magnetic groups in arbitrary dimensions. In the last part of the paper, we discuss Mackey's restriction of an induced representation to a subgroup, the tensor product of induced representations and the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of induced representations.</description>

      <title>Discrete equations and auto-traveling kinks of the $\phi^6$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\phi^{6}$ model and derive two broad classes of lattice discretizations that admit static, translationally invariant kinks; that is, stationary kink profiles that can be centered at an arbitrary position relative to the lattice. These discretizations are constructed using a one-dimensional map, $\phi_{n+1}=F(\phi_{n})$, which provides a direct and systematic algorithm for generating such models. Numerical computations for two representative cases show that the discrete kinks do not possess internal modes, consistent with the continuum theory, although an additional high-frequency mode may appear above the phonon band. We also show that generic discretizations of the $\phi^{6}$ model do not support static kink solutions. Instead, the resulting dynamics produce auto-traveling and self-accelerating kinks that propagate at the maximal group velocity while continuously emitting radiation.</description>

      <title>Dispersionless version of multi-component Pfaff-Toda hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dispersionless limit of the recently introduced multi-component Pfaff-Toda hierarchy. Its dispersionless version is a set of nonlinear differential equations for the dispersionless limit of logarithm of the tau-function (the F-function). They are obtained as limiting cases of bilinear equations of the Hirota-Miwa type. The analysis of the Pfaff-Toda hierarchy is substantially simplified by using the observation that the full (not only dispersionless) N-component Pfaff-Toda hierarchy is actually equivalent to the 2N-component DKP hierarchy. In the dispersionless limit, there is an elliptic curve built in the structure of the hierarchy, with the elliptic modular parameter being a dynamical variable. This curve can be uniformized by elliptic functions, and in the elliptic parametrization the hierarchy acquires a compact and especially nice form.</description>

      <title>Time Reparametrization, Not Fractional Calculus: A Reassessment of the Conformable Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformable derivative has been promoted in numerous publications as a new fractional derivative operator. This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quasi-harmonic spectra from branched Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization to assess the spectrum of the modified Emden equation $\ddot{x} + kx\dot{x} + \omega^2 x + \frac{k^2}{9}x^3 = 0$, which is an isochronous case of the Li\'enard-Kukles equation. While its classical isochronicity and canonical quantization, leading to polynomial solutions with an exactly-equispaced spectrum have been discussed earlier, including in the recent paper [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 64, 212 (2025)], the present study focuses on the quantization of its branched Hamiltonians. For small $k$, we show numerically that the resulting energy spectrum is no longer perfectly harmonic but only approximately equispaced, exhibiting quasi-harmonic behavior characterized by deviations from uniform spacing. Our numerical results are precisely validated by analytical calculations based on perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider consensus of multi-agent systems as a dual problem to Markov processes. Based on an exchange of relevant notions and results between the two fields, we present a uniform framework which admits the introduction and treatment of time delays in a common setting. We study both information propagation and information processing delays, and for each case derive conditions for reaching consensus and calculate the consensus value.</description>

      <title>On the Reynolds-number scaling of Poisson solver complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to answer the following question: is the complexity of numerically solving the Poisson equation increasing or decreasing for very large simulations of incompressible flows? Physical and numerical arguments are combined to derive power-law scalings at very high Reynolds numbers. A theoretical convergence analysis for both Jacobi and multigrid solvers defines a two-dimensional phase space divided into two regions depending on whether the number of solver iterations tends to decrease or increase with the Reynolds number. Numerical results indicate that, for Navier-Stokes turbulence, the complexity decreases with increasing Reynolds number, whereas for the one-dimensional Burgers equation it follows the opposite trend. The proposed theoretical framework thus provides a unified perspective on how solver convergence scales with the Reynolds number and offers valuable guidance for the development of next-generation preconditioning and multigrid strategies for extreme-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Global Martingale Entropy Solutions to the Stochastic Isentropic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence and compactness of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy for the stochastically forced system of isentropic Euler equations governed by a general pressure law. To achieve these, a stochastic compensated compactness framework in $L^p$ is developed to overcome the difficulty that the uniform $L^{\infty}$ bound for the stochastic approximate solutions is unavailable, owing to the stochastic forcing term. The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system. The stochastic compensated compactness framework and the uniform estimate techniques for approximate solutions developed in this paper should be useful in the study of other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Fast mixing in Ising models with a negative spectral outlier via Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics for Ising models in which the interaction matrix contains a single negative spectral outlier. This class includes the anti-ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on expander graphs, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with disorder of negative mean. Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.
  To address this difficulty, we develop a new covariance approximation method based on Gaussian approximation. This method is implemented via an iterative application of Stein's method to quadratic tilts of sums of bounded random variables, which may be of independent interest. The resulting analysis provides an operator-norm control of the full correlation structure under arbitrary external fields. Combined with the localization schemes of Eldan and Chen, these estimates lead to a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and near-optimal mixing time bounds in regimes where spectral width bounds fail. As a complementary result, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mixing time for low temperature anti-ferromagnetic Ising models on sparse Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, based on the existence of gapped states as in the recent work of Sellke.</description>

      <title>Blowup rate for rotational NLS with a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an analytical proof of the ``$\log$-$\log$'' blowup rate for mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a rotation ($\Omega \neq 0$) and a repulsive harmonic potential $V_{\gamma}(x) = \textrm{sgn}(\gamma) \gamma^2 |x|^2$, $\gamma &lt; 0$ when the initial data has a mass slightly above that of $Q$, the ground state solution to the free NLS. The proof is based on a virial identity and an $\mathcal{R}_{\gamma}$-transform, a pseudo-conformal transform in this setting. Further, we obtain a limiting behavior description concerning the mass concentration near blowup time. A remarkable finding is that increasing the value $|\gamma|$ for the repulsive potential $V_{\gamma}$ can give rise to global in time solution for the focusing RNLS, which is in contrast to the case where $\gamma$ is positive. This kind of phenomenon was earlier observed in the non-rotational case $\Omega = 0$ in Carles' work. In addition, we provide numerical simulations to partially illustrate the blowup profile along with the blowup rate using dynamic rescaling and adaptive mesh refinement method.</description>

      <title>Random matrix prediction of average entanglement entropy in non-Abelian symmetry sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the average bipartite entanglement entropy of Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry, constrained to fixed total spin $J$ and magnetization $J_z = 0$. Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study standing waves for the Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation in dimension 1 and 2. The Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a confining potential and a multiplicative spatial white noise. Standing waves are characterized by a profile which is invariant by the dynamic and solves a nonlinear elliptic equation with spatial white noise potential. We construct such solutions via variational methods and obtain some results on their regularity, localization and stability.</description>

      <title>Panhandle polynomials of torus links and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a decomposition of the tensor of the fundamental representation of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_N)$ and the Rosso-Jones formula to establish a peculiar ``panhandle'' shape of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of the reverse parallel of torus knots and links. Due to their panhandle-like intrinsic properties, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial is referred to as a ``panhandle polynomial''. With the help of the $\ell$-invariant, this extends to links the Etnyre-Honda result about the arc index and maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant of torus knots. It has further geometric consequences, related to the braid index, the existence of minimal string Bennequin surfaces for banded and Whitehead doubled links, the Bennequin sharpness problem, and the equivalence of their quasipositivity and strong quasipositivity. We extend these properties to torus links, which relate to the classification of their component-wise Thurston-Bennequin invariants. Finally, we discuss the definition of the $\ell$-invariant for general links.</description>

      <title>Generalised Entanglement Entropies from Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</description>

      <title>On the efficient numerical computation of covariant Lyapunov vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) are useful in multiple applications, but the optimal time windows needed to accurately compute these vectors are yet unclear. To remedy this, we investigate two methods for determining when to safely terminate the forward and backward transient phases of the CLV computation algorithm by Ginelli et al.~\cite{GinelliEtAl2007} when applied to chaotic orbits of conservative Hamiltonian systems. We perform this investigation for two prototypical Hamiltonian systems, namely the well-known H\'enon-Heiles system of two degrees of freedom and a system of three nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators having three degrees of freedom, finding very similar results for the two methods and thus recommending the more efficient one. We find that the accuracy of two-dimesnional center subspace computations is significantly reduced when the backward evolution stages of the algorithm are performed over long time intervals. We explain this observation by examining the tangent dynamics of the center subspace wherein CLVs tend to align/anti-align, and we propose an adaptation of the algorithm that improves the accuracy of such computations over long times by preventing this alignment/anti-alignment of CLVs in the center subspace.</description>

      <title>The topological life of Dynkin indices: universal scaling and matter selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For simple, simply-connected compact Lie groups, Dynkin embedding indices obey a universal scaling law with a direct topological meaning. Given an inclusion $f:G\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $\pi_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(\Sigma{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $\beta$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact relation between the S-symplectomorphism and the S-matrix by means of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The adjoint action of the S-matrix defines a fuzzy diffeomorphism on phase space whose classical limit is the S-symplectomorphism. The relation between classical and quantum eikonals is immediate via $\hbar$-deformation of each Poisson bracket in the Magnus formula. Diagrammatic computation of quantum eikonal is illustrated for quantizations in both symmetric and normal orderings.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Field Wave Dynamics and Quasinormal Modes of the Teo Rotating Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze scalar field perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole and compute its quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum using WKB methods in a fully horizonless geometry. The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schr\"odinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>q-Opers and Bethe Ansatz for Open Spin Chains I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In in a nutshell, the classical geometric $q$-Langlands duality can be viewed as a correspondence between the space of $(G,q)$-opers and the space of solutions of $^L\mathfrak{g}$ XXZ Bethe Ansatz equations. The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized FAMED property for ideal triangulations of hyperbolic knot complements in $\mathbb{S}^3$. Given a hyperbolic knot $K$ in $\mathbb{S}^3$ and a semi-geometric triangulation $X$ of $\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K$ that is generalized FAMED with respect to the longitude. We prove that in the semi-classical limit $\hbar \to 0^+$, for any angle structure $\alpha$, the partition function $\mathscr{Z}_\hbar(X,\alpha)$ in Teichm\"uller TQFT decays exponentially with decrease rate the volume of $\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K$ equipped with a hyperbolic cone structure determined by $\alpha$, and that the 1-loop invariant of Dimofte-Garoufalidis emerges as the 1-loop term. With additional combinatorial conditions on the triangulations, we prove the existence of the Jones function and show that its decay rate is governed by the Neumann-Zagier potential function. In particular, the Andersen-Kashaev volume conjecture holds for every hyperbolic knot whose complement admits such kinds of triangulations.</description>

      <title>Motion of extended fluid bodies in the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity, for an isolated self-gravitating system consisting of $N$ extended fluid bodies, the inter-body dynamics are studied by applying the symmetric and trace-free formalism in terms of irreducible Cartesian tensors. The multipole expansion of each body's center-of-mass acceleration is derived, and the expansion comprises the Coulomb-type part and the Yukawa-type part, where the former, identical to that in General Relativity, is encoded by the products of the mass multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies, and the latter, as the modification introduced by $f(R)$ gravity, is encoded by the products of the scalar multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies. As an essential component of the system's orbital dynamics, the multipole expansion for the total gravitational potential energy is provided, and the expression for the total conserved energy in terms of the mass and scalar multipole moments of the bodies is offered. To investigate the system's spin dynamics, the equation of motion for each body's spin angular momentum is further deduced and presented in the form of multipole expansion. These findings constitute the main content of the coarse-grained description of inter-body dynamics for the system within the framework of the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. As a by-product, for a two-body system, the effective one-body equation governing the relative motion between the two bodies and the total energy of this system are achieved.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach to Solving First-Kind Fredholm Integral Equations and Their Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical recovery of solutions to first-kind Fredholm integral equations with discrete, scattered, and noisy pointwise measurements. Assuming the forward operator's range belongs to the Sobolev space of order $m$, which implies algebraic singular-value decay $s_j\le Cj^{-m}$, we derive optimal upper bounds for the reconstruction error in the weak topology under an a priori choice of the regularization parameter. For bounded-variance noise, we establish mean-square error rates that explicitly quantify the dependence on sample size $n$, noise level $\sigma$, and smoothness index $m$; under sub-Gaussian noise, we strengthen these to exponential concentration bounds. The analysis yields an explicit a priori and a posteriori rule for the regularization parameter. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of our practical parameter choice.</description>

      <title>Bethe subspaces and wonderful models for toric arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the family of commutative subspaces in the trigonometric holonomy Lie algebra $t^{\mathrm{trig}}_{\Phi}$, introduced by Toledano Laredo, for an arbitrary root system $\Phi$. We call these subspaces \emph{Bethe subspaces} because they can be regarded as quadratic components of \emph{Bethe subalgebras} in the Yangian corresponding to the root system $\Phi$, that are responsible for integrals of the generalized XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Bethe subspaces are naturally parametrized by the complement of the corresponding toric arrangement . We prove that this family extends regularly to the minimal wonderful model $X_{\Phi}$ of the toric arrangement described by De Concini and Gaiffi, thus giving a compactification of the parameter space for Bethe subspaces. For classical types $A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n$, we show that this extension is faithful. As a special case, when $\Phi$ is of type $A_n$, our construction agrees with the main result of Aguirre--Felder--Veselov on the closure of the set of quadratic Gaudin subalgebras. Our work is also closely related to, and refines in this root system setting, a parallel compactification result of J. Peters obtained for more general toric arrangements arising from quantum multiplication on hypertoric varieties. Next, we show that the Bethe subspaces assemble into a vector bundle over $X_{\Phi}$, which we identify with the logarithmic tangent bundle of $X_{\Phi}$. Finally, we formulate conjectures extending these results to the setting of Bethe subalgebras in Yangians and to the quantum cohomology rings of Springer resolutions. We plan to address this in our next papers.</description>

      <title>On the Brown measure of $x + i y$, with $x,y$ selfadjoint and $y$ free Poisson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $x,y$ be freely independent selfadjoint elements in a $W^{*}$-probability space, where $y$ has free Poisson distribution of parameter $p$. We pursue a methodology for computing the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure of $x + i y$, which relies on the matrix-valued subordination function $\Omega$ of the Hermitization of $x + i y$, and on the fact that $\Omega$ has an explicitly described left inverse $H$. Our main point is that the Brown measure of $x + i y$ becomes more approachable when it is reparametrized via a certain change of variable $h : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{M}$, with $\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{M}$ open subsets of $\mathbb{C}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ and $h$ are defined in terms of the aforementioned left inverse $H$, and $\mathrm{cl} \,(\mathcal{M})$ contains the support of the Brown measure. More precisely, we find (with some conditions on the distribution of $x$, which have to be imposed for certain values of the parameter $p$) the following formula: \[ f(s + i \, t) =\frac{1}{4\pi}\left[\frac{2}{t}\left(\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial s} +\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial t}\right)-\frac{2}{t}-\frac{2\beta}{t^2}\right], \ \ s + i \, t \in \mathcal{M}, \] where $f$ is the density of the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure and the functions $\alpha, \beta : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}$ are the real and respectively the imaginary part of $h^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism: Emergence of Alterferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.</description>

      <title>On regions of mixed unitarity for semigroups of unital quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is established that both discrete and continuous semigroups of unital quantum channels are eventually mixed unitary. However, after introducing the mixed unitary index of a unital quantum channel as the least time beyond which all subsequent powers of the channel are mixed unitary, we demonstrate that for any fixed finite dimension $d\geq 3$, there exists no universal upper bound for this index. Furthermore, for a continuous semigroup that is not mixed unitary for some $t&gt;0$, we prove it remains non-mixed unitary for all times $t&gt;0$, sufficiently close to the origin. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for a quantum dynamical semigroup to be a convex combination of maps implemented solely by Weyl unitaries.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study lifts of integrable systems by means of generalized St\"ackel geometry. To this aim, we present the notion of St\"ackel lift as a unified setting for the construction of new classes of integrable Hamiltonian systems of physical interest. The St\"ackel lift extends the geometric framework underlying both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian-type classical Eisenhart lifts. Moreover, we prove that Hamiltonian systems constructed through momentum-dependent St\"ackel matrices are naturally endowed with a non-trivial symplectic-Haantjes structure.
  We further illustrate applications to magnetic systems separable in cylindrical coordinates; we describe them within the St\"ackel framework by means of modified St\"ackel basis.
  We also show that explicitly momentum-dependent lifting matrices produce systems interpretable as gravitational waves, or momentum-dependent metrics of Hamilton and Finsler geometries, with potential applications in modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of solvable multi-matrix models associated with an arbitrary embedded graph $\Gamma$ with a single vertex. The graph with $n$ edges is equipped with $2n$ corner matrices. The partition function of each member of the family depends on the set of eigenvalues of monodromies of corner matrices around the vertices of the dual graph $\Gamma^*$ and sets of parameters attached to each vertex of $\Gamma$. We select the cases where the partition function of a model is a tau function of KP, 2KP and BKP hiearachies. We compare integrals over ${U}(N)$ and over ${SU}(N)$ groups. In $U(N)$ case there is no restriction on the number of vertices of $\Gamma$. We also consider mixed ensembles of matrices from $GL(N),U(N)$ and $SU(N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite dimensional quantum systems with arbitrary collapse events, establishing, under no-information-erasure conditions, a structural no-go for trajectory-level operational irreversibility. More precisely, we fix a realization map (a physically admissible selector of the collapse dynamics) and do not rely on any regularity of the induced dynamics. We prove that, for every realization of the collapse dynamics, there exists a topologically closed, forward-invariant subset of the projective state space on which any two states can be connected with arbitrarily fine Fubini-Study precision and arbitrarily small integrated energetic cost. This shows that the preservation of information along a realized branch guarantees islands of quasi-reversibility, while genuine irreversibility requires additional ingredients such as non-compactness, explicit erasure, or coupling to reservoirs.

Fixing a point in S^1 and identifying the real line with the punctured circle, we consider the subalgebra Sg of Lg of rapidly decreasing elements on R. We classify the translation-invariant 2-cocycles on Sg. We show that the ground state representation of Sg is unique for each cocycle. These ground states correspond precisely to the vacuum representations of Lg.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Fefferman spaces over CR three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalisation of Fefferman's conformal circle bundle over a contact Cauchy-Riemann three-manifold. These can be viewed as exact `perturbations' of Fefferman's structure by a semi-basic one-form, which encodes additional data on the CR three-manifold.
  We find conditions on the Weyl tensor and the Bach tensor for a Lorentzian conformal four-manifold equipped with a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics to be locally conformally isometric to such a perturbed Fefferman space.
  We investigate the existence of metrics in the perturbed Fefferman conformal class satisfying appropriate sub-conditions of the Einstein equations, such as the so-called pure radiation equations. These metrics are defined only off cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in terms of densities that generalise Gover's notion of almost Einstein scales. Our setup allows us to reduce the prescriptions on the Ricci tensor to the underlying CR three-manifold in terms of differential constraints on a complex density and the CR data of the perturbation one-form. One such constraint turns out to arise from a non-linear, or gauged, analogue of a second-order differential operator on densities. A solution thereof provides a criterion for the existence of a CR function and, under certain conditions, for the realisability of the CR three-manifold. These findings are consistent with previous works by Lewandowski, Nurowski, Tafel, Hill, and independently, by Mason.
  We also provide an analysis of the Weyl curvature of such conformal structures in terms of the underlying CR data. In particular, we arrive at a CR formulation of the asymptotic Einstein condition by viewing conformal infinity as a cross-section of Fefferman's circle bundle.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to estimate the tail of the distribution of the number of particles in an interval under determinantal and Pfaffian point processes. The main result of the note is that the square of the number of particles under the determinantal point process whose correlation kernel is an entire function of finite order has sub-Poissonian tails. The same result also holds in the symplectic Pfaffian case. As a corollary, sub-Poissonian estimates are also obtained for exponential moments of additive functionals over pairs of particles.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. It is shown in Hashimoto-Matsumura(2021) that if the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, then there exists a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(r)$ with $r\equiv |x|$. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. In addition, we also derive a set of spatial decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the time-asymptotic stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ using the energy method. More specifically, we prove this under small initial perturbation on $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, provided that the density at the far-field is supposed to be strictly positive but suitably small, in other words, the far-field state of the fluid is not vacuum but suitably rarefied. The main difficulty for the proof is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Solving the Learning-With-Errors Problem on NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a fundamental computational challenge with implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model to address LWE, transforming it into the Shortest Vector Problem and using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. By identifying low-energy Hamiltonian levels, the solution is extracted, making the method suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The required number of qubits is less than $m(m+1)$, where $m$ is the number of samples. Our heuristic algorithm's time complexity depends on the specific quantum eigensolver used to find low-energy levels, and the performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is investigated. We validate the algorithm by solving a $2$-dimensional LWE problem on a $5$-qubit quantum device, demonstrating its potential for solving meaningful LWE instances on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Cups and Gates I: Cohomology invariants and logical quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take initial steps towards a general framework for constructing logical gates in general quantum CSS codes. Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere can be rigid under smooth deformations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>On palindromic numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From our work on partition functions in log gravity, we show that the palindromic numerators in two variables of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series take the form of sums of products of Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated with a pair of partition $\lambda$ and $\mu=(1^n)$. The log partition function also being a KP $\tau$-function, our work gives a new description of Hall-Littlewood and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials as palindromic numerators of quotient expansions in the moduli space of formal power series solutions of the KP hierarchy. Using the structure and properties of the log partition function, we also show that the palindromic polynomials are eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a semi-global existence and convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \sim M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from a class of arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like `time'. A main novelty is to uncover a new weak null-type structure (different from the well known null structure in the literature) in the field equations induced by the positive cosmological constant in constant mean curvature gauge that is absent in pure vacuum. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic in-distinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime of Einstein-$\Lambda$ dynamics. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>

      <title>Concentration via metastable mixing, with applications to the supercritical exponential random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Folklore belief holds that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Chiral higher-spin symmetry of the celestial twistor sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the chiral higher-spin symmetry algebras $\mathfrak{ca}$ of various twistorial higher-spin theories. These symmetries play the roles of asymptotic symmetries on the celestial twistor sphere, which constrain the observables of twistorial theories. To first order in quantum correction, we show that the chiral algebras associated with anomaly-free holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories are associative themselves. On the other hand, the chiral algebras associated with anomalous holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories only become associative upon including suitable axionic currents. When computing $4d$ form factors in terms of correlation functions between higher-spin currents on the celestial twistor sphere, we observe that there are some non-vanishing higher-spin form factors. This observation, however, is only well justified for the case of theories with Yang-Mills-like interactions. We also give some brief comments on the case of higher-derivative interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: We study a general class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite volume under weak nonlinearity scaling and with non-equilibrium initial data. We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of these equations. This makes rigorous the original derivation of the KPZ equation from physics in the full-space setting, which was a problem posed by Hairer-Quastel '18. Our analysis is based on a stochastic heat kernel for a linearization of said SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Ladder Operators for Laguerre-type and Jacobi-type Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature concerning the Laguerre-type weight function $x^\lambda w_0(x), x\in[0,+\infty)$, the Jacobi-type weight function $(1-x)^{\alpha}(1+x)^{\beta}w_0(x),x\in[-1,1]$, and the shifted Jacobi-type weight function $x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta}w_0(x), x\in[0,1]$, with $w_0(x)$ continuously differentiable, the parameters $\lambda,\alpha,\beta$ are usually constrained to be strictly positive to ensure the validity of the results. Recently, in [C. Min and P. Fang, Physica D 473 (2025), 134560 (9pp)], the ladder operators for the monic Laguerre-type orthogonal polynomials with $\lambda&gt;-1$ were derived by exploiting the orthogonality properties. The quantities $A_n$ and $B_n$, which appear as coefficients in the ladder operators, exhibit different expressions compared with the previous ones for $\lambda&gt;0$. In this paper, we construct an alternative deduction by making use of the Riemann-Hilbert problem satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials. Moreover, we employ both derivation strategies mentioned above to produce the ladder operators for the monic standard and shifted Jacobi-type orthogonal polynomials with $\alpha,\beta&gt;-1$. When $\lambda,\alpha,\beta$ are restricted to positive values, our expressions of $A_n$ and $B_n$ are consistent with those in prior work. We present examples to validate our findings and generalize the existing conclusions, established by using the three compatibility conditions of the ladder operators and differentiating the orthogonality relations for the monic orthogonal polynomials, from $\lambda,\alpha,\beta&gt;0$ to $\lambda,\alpha,\beta&gt;-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Modified open Toda chain and quasi-integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of a quasi-integrable deformation of the three-particle open Toda chain, constructed by introducing a translation-invariant three-body interaction terms. Although this modification explicitly breaks the exact integrability of the standard Toda model, it retains fundamental structural properties, including energy and momentum conservation. Furthermore, we show that under a specific time-reflection and discrete symmetry among the chain coordinates, the system admits a quasi-conserved higher-order integral. Through analytic and numerical analysis of the deformed dynamics, we demonstrate the emergence and long-time persistence of quasi-conserved quantities, thereby establishing a controlled realization of quasi-integrability in a minimal nonlinear chain. Given the central role of integrable systems in elucidating the dynamics of classical and quantum models, this framework provides a concrete setting to investigate the mechanisms underlying the gradual breakdown of integrability and the onset of quasi-integrability in few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of generalized abcd Boussinesq solitary waves under a slowly variable bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in $\mathbb R_t\times\mathbb R_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as first-order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two-dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among the various particular regimes, each determined by the values of the parameters $(a, b, c, d)$ appearing in the equations, the \emph{generic} regime is characterized by the conditions $b, d &gt; 0$ and $a, c &lt; 0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is Hamiltonian.
  In this paper, we investigate the existence of generalized solitary waves and the corresponding collision problem in the physically relevant \emph{variable bottom regime}, introduced by M.\ Chen. More precisely, the bottom is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=\varepsilon h_0(\varepsilon t,\varepsilon x)$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter and $h_0$ is a fixed smooth profile. This formulation allows for a detailed description of weak long-range interactions and the evolution of the solitary wave without its destruction. We establish this result by constructing a new approximate solution that captures the interaction between the solitary wave and the slowly varying bottom.</description>

Abstract: The theory of admissible modules over symmetrizable anisotropic Kac-Moody superalgebras, introduced by Kac and Wakimoto in late 80's, is a well-developed subject with many applications, including representation theory of vertex algebras. Recently this theory was developed in a more general setup by Gorelik and Serganova. In the present paper we develop in this more general setup the theory of admissible modules over arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Device Constraints: A System-Level Theoretical Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>

Abstract: Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the enhanced single-photon detection (ESPD) framework is presented as a system-level theoretical paradigm that shifts photon detection from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing task, by reformulating it as an iteratively enhanced process integrating state-preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis. ESPD enables systematic performance enhancement through architectural design rather than material modification, thereby circumventing superconducting components, allowing high-performance detection using exclusively room-temperature hardware. Numerical simulations grounded in physically motivated parameters indicate that the ESPD framework can upgrade a conventional room-temperature SPD to effective DE exceeding 93\% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, which are comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs and can significantly relax the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate in quantum communications. While physical realization would require further component integration, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework for enhancing detection performance through architectural quantum-information principles, providing a general blueprint for transcending device-level constraints and guiding the development of next-generation room-temperature quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <title>Classical billiards can compute</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional billiard systems are Turing complete by encoding their dynamics within the framework of Topological Kleene Field Theory. Billiards serve as idealized models of particle motion with elastic reflections and arise naturally as limits of smooth Hamiltonian systems under steep confining potentials. Our results establish the existence of undecidable trajectories in physically natural billiard-type models, including billiard-type models arising in hard-sphere gases and in collision-chain limits of celestial mechanics.</description>
