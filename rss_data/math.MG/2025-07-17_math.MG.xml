      <title>On Steiner entire function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Steiner entire function, an analytic generating function for the intrinsic volumes of a convex compact set in a Hilbert space. This function extends the classical Steiner polynomial to infinite dimensions and encodes key geometric information about the set. We establish fundamental results on its order, type, and canonical product representation, and show how its analytic growth properties characterize Gaussian continuity. In particular, we provide new criteria for this property in terms of entire function theory, disprove a conjecture of Gao and Vitale, and conjecture a new characterization of admissible intrinsic volume sequences in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The curvature exponent $N_{\mathrm{curv}}$ of a metric measure space is the smallest number $N$ for which the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(0,N)$ holds. In this paper, we study the curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups equipped with the Lebesgue measure. We prove that $N_{\mathrm{curv}} \geq 5$, and the equality holds if and only if the corresponding sub-Finsler Heisenberg group is actually sub-Riemannian. Furthermore, we show that for every $N\geq 5$, there is a sub-Finsler structure on the Heisenberg group such that $N_{\mathrm{curv}}=N$.</description>

      <title>On the Figiel-Lindenstrauss-Milman inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Figiel-Lindenstrauss-Milman inequality is a fundamental inequality in the combinatorial theory of polytopes. It is classically obtained as a corollary of Milman's version of Dvoretzky's theorem. The goal of this paper is to provide a short and elementary proof of this inequality, derive more general versions of it, and discuss its tightness, where much is not known.</description>

      <title>Growth rates of groups, harmonic functions and the strong Liouville property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the growth of positive harmonic functions, the strong Liouville property and the large scale geometry of finitely generated groups. We first show that the existence of one non-constant minimal harmonic function of slow (respectively, fast) growth rate guarantees that the space spanned by minimal harmonic functions of slow (respectively, fast) growth is infinite dimensional. We give a geometric-analytic characterisation for the strong Liouville property in terms of a functional involving the Green's function, which has immediate applications to groups with reasonable heat kernel bounds, including groups of polynomial as well as exponential growth. On the way, we show that under certain assumptions, strong Liouville property implies that the Green speed is zero.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <title>A (Hilbert) geometric algorithm for approximating the halfspace depth of a point in a convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Halfspace (or Tukey) depth is a fundamental and robust measure of centrality of data points in multivariate datasets. Computing the depth of a point with respect to the uniform distribution on an open convex body in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a natural algorithmic problem. While the coarser task of testing membership in convex bodies has been extensively studied, the refined problem of evaluating depth has received comparatively little attention in the literature.
  In this work, we present an algorithm for approximating the halfspace depth of a point in an open convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d.$ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic algorithm for this problem. As part of our approach, we design an algorithm for answering approximate membership queries for the depth-trimmed regions of $K$ (i.e., the superlevel sets of the depth function). Our data structure is inspired by recent work of Abdelkader and Mount [SOSA 2024], wherein approximate membership queries for $K$ are answered using geometric structures derived from the Hilbert metric on $K.$ A key component underlying our data structure is a novel quantitative comparison between the depth-trimmed regions and the Hilbert metric balls of $K$.
  Lastly, to highlight the computational expense of the problem, we present an algorithm for determining the exact depth of a point in an open planar convex polygon presented as the intersection of finitely many halfplanes.</description>

      <title>Gr\"unbaum's inequality for Gaussian and convex probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result in convex geometry is Gr\"unbaum's inequality, which quantifies how much volume of a convex body can be cut off by a hyperplane passing through its barycenter. In this work, we establish a series of sharp Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities - with equality characterizations - for probability measures under certain concavity assumptions. As an application, we apply the renowned Ehrhard inequality and deduce an ``Ehrhard-Gr\"unbaum'' inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which improves upon the bound derived from its log-concavity.
  For $s$-concave Radon measures, our framework provides a simpler proof of known results and, more importantly, yields the previously missing equality characterization. This is achieved by gaining new insight into the equality case of their Brunn-Minkowski-type inequality. Moreover, we show that these ``$s$-Gr\"unbaum'' inequalities can hold only when $s &gt; -1$. However, for convex measures on the real line, we prove Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities involving their cumulative distribution function.</description>
