      <title>There are (other) ways to negate in propositional team semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The languages of logics based on team semantics typically only allow atomic negation or restricted negation. In this paper, we explore propositional team-based logics with full (intuitionistic) negation. We demonstrate that including full intutionistic negation does not complicate the axiomatization of propositional team-based logics with the downward closure property. We also review known expressive completeness results for these logics, highlighting how relevant complemented properties are expressed in propositional dependence logic without directly using negation. Building on these insights, we also prove a new result: propositional logic extended with both dependence and inclusion atoms is expressively complete.</description>

      <title>On the Isbell problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three models concerning Tukey types of ultrafilters on $\omega$. The first model is built via a countable support iteration, and we show there is no basically generated ultrafilter in such model. The second and third models are built upon different and novel techniques, and in such models all ultrafilters are Tukey top, thus providing an answer to the Isbell problem. In all models there is no $\mathsf{nwd}$-ultrafilter.</description>

      <title>Walks on uncountable ordinals and non-structure theorems for higher Aronszajn lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that if there is an $\aleph_2$-Aronszajn line, then there is one that does not contain an $\aleph_2$-Countryman line. This solves a problem of Moore and stands in a sharp contrast with his Basis Theorem for linear orders of size $\aleph_1$.
  The proof combines walks on ordinals, club guessing, strong colourings of three different types, and a bit of finite combinatorics. This and further non-structure theorems for Aronszajn lines and trees are established for successors of regulars, successors of singulars, as well as inaccessibles.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>Bounding the degree of generic sharp transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a generically sharply $t$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ satisfies $t\le r+2$ provided the pointwise stabilizer of a generic $(t-1)$-tuple is an $L$-group, which holds, for example, when this stabilizer is solvable or when $r\le 5$. This makes progress on the Borovik-Cherlin conjecture that every generically $(r+2)$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ is of the form $\operatorname{PGL}_{r+1}(F)$ acting naturally on $\mathbb{P}^r(F)$.
  Our proof is assembled from three key ingredients that are independent of the main theorem - these address actions of $\operatorname{Alt}(n)$ on $L$-groups of finite Morley rank, generically $2$-transitive actions with abelian point stabilizers, and simple groups of rank $6$.</description>
