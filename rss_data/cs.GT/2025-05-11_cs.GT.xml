      <title>Discrete Budget Aggregation: Truthfulness and Proportionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a budget aggregation setting where voters express their preferred allocation of a fixed budget over a set of alternatives, and a mechanism aggregates these preferences into a single output allocation. Motivated by scenarios in which the budget is not perfectly divisible, we depart from the prevailing literature by restricting the mechanism to output allocations that assign integral amounts. This seemingly minor deviation has significant implications for the existence of truthful mechanisms. Specifically, when voters can propose fractional allocations, we demonstrate that the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem can be extended to our setting. In contrast, when voters are restricted to integral ballots, we identify a class of truthful mechanisms by adapting moving-phantom mechanisms to our context. Moreover, we show that while a weak form of proportionality can be achieved alongside truthfulness, (stronger) proportionality notions derived from approval-based committee voting are incompatible with truthfulness.</description>

      <title>Distance Preservation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze distance preservation games (DPGs). In DPGs, agents express ideal distances to other agents and need to choose locations in the unit interval while preserving their ideal distances as closely as possible. We analyze the existence and computation of location profiles that are jump stable (i.e., no agent can benefit by moving to another location) or welfare optimal for DPGs, respectively. Specifically, we prove that there are DPGs without jump stable location profiles and identify important cases where such outcomes always exist and can be computed efficiently. Similarly, we show that finding welfare optimal location profiles is NP-complete and present approximation algorithms for finding solutions with social welfare close to optimal. Finally, we prove that DPGs have a price of anarchy of at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Best of Both Worlds Guarantees for Equitable Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equitability is a well-studied fairness notion in fair division, where an allocation is equitable if all agents receive equal utility from their allocation. For indivisible items, an exactly equitable allocation may not exist, and a natural relaxation is EQ1, which stipulates that any inequitability should be resolved by the removal of a single item. In this paper, we study equitability in the context of randomized allocations. Specifically, we aim to achieve equitability in expectation (ex ante EQ) and require that each deterministic outcome in the support satisfies ex post EQ1. Such an allocation is commonly known as a `Best of Both Worlds' allocation, and has been studied, e.g., for envy-freeness and MMS.
  We characterize the existence of such allocations using a geometric condition on linear combinations of EQ1 allocations, and use this to give comprehensive results on both existence and computation. For two agents, we show that ex ante EQ and ex post EQ1 allocations always exist and can be computed in polynomial time. For three or more agents, however, such allocations may not exist. We prove that deciding existence of such allocations is strongly NP-complete in general, and weakly NP-complete even for three agents. We also present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for a constant number of agents. We show that when agents have binary valuations, best of both worlds allocations that additionally satisfy welfare guarantees exist and are efficiently computable.</description>

      <title>DaringFed: A Dynamic Bayesian Persuasion Pricing for Online Federated Learning under Two-sided Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Federated Learning (OFL) is a real-time learning paradigm that sequentially executes parameter aggregation immediately for each random arriving client. To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to offer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption. However, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the dynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning resources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing computational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time communication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to participate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we design a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated learning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the interaction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing allocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the existence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the optimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further analyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under TII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that DaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments with synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and the effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to 12.6%.</description>

      <title>Probability of a Condorcet Winner for Large Electorates: An Analytic Combinatorics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability that a given candidate is an alpha-winner, i.e. a candidate preferred to each other candidate j by a fraction alpha_j of the voters. This extends the classical notion of Condorcet winner, which corresponds to the case alpha = (1/2, ..., 1/2). Our analysis is conducted under the general assumption that voters have independent preferences, illustrated through applications to well-known models such as Impartial Culture and the Mallows model. While previous works use probabilistic arguments to derive the limiting probability as the number of voters tends to infinity, we employ techniques from the field of analytic combinatorics to compute convergence rates and provide a method for obtaining higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion. In particular, we establish that the probability of a given candidate being the Condorcet winner in Impartial Culture is a_0 + a_{1, n} n^{-1/2} + O(n^{-1}), where we explicitly provide the values of the constant a_0 and the coefficient a_{1, n}, which depends solely on the parity of the number of voters n. Along the way, we derive technical results in multivariate analytic combinatorics that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Power of Matching for Online Fractional Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coalition formation in the framework of fractional hedonic games (FHGs). The objective is to maximize social welfare in an online model where agents arrive one by one and must be assigned to coalitions immediately and irrevocably. For general online FHGs, it is known that computing maximal matchings achieves the optimal competitive ratio, which is, however, unbounded for unbounded agent valuations.
  We achieve a constant competitive ratio in two related settings while carving out further connections to matchings. If algorithms can dissolve coalitions, then the optimal competitive ratio of $\frac{1}{6+4\sqrt{2}}$ is achieved by a matching-based algorithm. Moreover, we perform a tight analysis for the online matching setting under random arrival with an unknown number of agents. This entails a randomized $\frac 16$-competitive algorithm for FHGs, while no algorithm can be better than $\frac 13$-competitive.</description>

      <title>Fusion-PSRO: Nash Policy Fusion for Policy Space Response Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21027v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For solving zero-sum games involving non-transitivity, a useful approach is to maintain a policy population to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous studies have shown that the Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) algorithm is an effective framework for solving such games. However, current methods initialize a new policy from scratch or inherit a single historical policy in Best Response (BR), missing the opportunity to leverage past policies to generate a better BR. In this paper, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which employs Nash Policy Fusion to initialize a new policy for BR training. Nash Policy Fusion serves as an implicit guiding policy that starts exploration on the current Meta-NE, thus providing a closer approximation to BR. Moreover, it insightfully captures a weighted moving average of past policies, dynamically adjusting these weights based on the Meta-NE in each iteration. This cumulative process further enhances the policy population. Empirical results on classic benchmarks show that Fusion-PSRO achieves lower exploitability, thereby mitigating the shortcomings of previous research on policy initialization in BR.</description>

      <title>On the Parallelizability of Approval-Based Committee Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approval-Based Committee (ABC) rules are an important tool for choosing a fair set of candidates when given the preferences of a collection of voters. Though finding a winning committee for many ABC rules is NP-hard, natural variations for these rules with polynomial-time algorithms exist. The recently introduced Method of Equal Shares, an important ABC rule with desirable properties, is also computable in polynomial time. However, when working with very large elections, polynomial time is not enough and parallelization may be necessary. We show that computing a winning committee using these ABC rules (including the Method of Equal Shares) is P-hard, thus showing they cannot be parallelized. In contrast, we show that finding a winning committee can be parallelized when the votes are single-peaked or single-crossing for the important ABC rule Chamberlin-Courant.</description>

      <title>Repositioning, Ride-matching, and Abandonment in On-demand Ride-hailing Platforms: A Mean Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The on-demand ride-hailing industry has experienced rapid growth, transforming transportation norms worldwide. Despite improvements in efficiency over traditional taxi services, significant challenges remain, including drivers' strategic repositioning behavior, customer abandonment, and inefficiencies in dispatch algorithms. To address these issues, we introduce a comprehensive mean field game model that systematically analyzes the dynamics of ride-hailing platforms by incorporating driver repositioning across multiple regions, customer abandonment behavior, and platform dispatch algorithms. Using this framework, we identify all possible mean field equilibria as the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of an associated optimization problem. Our analysis reveals the emergence of multiple equilibria, including the inefficient "Wild Goose Chase" one, characterized by drivers pursuing distant requests, leading to suboptimal system performance. To mitigate these inefficiencies, we propose a novel two-matching-radius nearest-neighbor dispatch algorithm that eliminates undesirable equilibria and ensures a unique mean field equilibrium for multi-region systems. The algorithm dynamically adjusts matching radii based on driver supply rates, optimizing pick-up times and waiting times for drivers while maximizing request completion rates. Numerical experiments and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces customer abandonment, minimizes waiting times for both customers and drivers, and improves overall platform efficiency.</description>

      <title>Timestamp Manipulation: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two advanced attack strategies, the Unrestricted Uncle Maker (UUM) Attack and the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM) Attack, which fundamentally threaten the security of timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchains by inflicting permanent systemic harm. Unlike prior work that merely enhances adversarial rewards, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in timestamp manipulation and fork selection rules to irreversibly destabilize blockchain fairness and incentive mechanisms. Specifically, the SUUM attack enables adversaries to persistently launch attacks at zero cost, eliminating constraints on block withholding and risk-free conditions, while systematically maximizing rewards through coordinated timestamp adjustments and strategic block release.
  Our analysis demonstrates that SUUM adversaries achieve disproportionate reward advantages over both UUM and the original Riskless Uncle Maker (RUM) Attack [CCS '23], with all three strategies surpassing honest mining. Crucially, SUUM's cost-free persistence allows adversaries to indefinitely drain rewards from honest participants by maintaining minimal difficulty risks through precise timestamp manipulation. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: adversaries amplify their profits while suppressing honest returns, thereby permanently eroding the protocol's security assumptions. Through rigorous theoretical modeling and simulations, we validate how SUUM's combination of timestamp tampering, block withholding, and difficulty risk control enables unmitigated exploitation of consensus mechanisms. This work underscores the existential risks posed by timestamp-based Nakamoto-style protocols and advocates urgent countermeasures to ensure long-term stability.</description>
