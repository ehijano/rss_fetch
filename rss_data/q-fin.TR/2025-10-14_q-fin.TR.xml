      <title>Efficient Triangular Arbitrage Detection via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triangular arbitrage is a profitable trading strategy in financial markets that exploits discrepancies in currency exchange rates. Traditional methods for detecting triangular arbitrage opportunities, such as exhaustive search algorithms and linear programming solvers, often suffer from high computational complexity and may miss potential opportunities in dynamic markets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to triangular arbitrage detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By representing the currency exchange network as a graph, we leverage the powerful representation and learning capabilities of GNNs to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities more efficiently. Specifically, we formulate the triangular arbitrage problem as a graph-based optimization task and design a GNN architecture that captures the complex relationships between currencies and exchange rates. We introduce a relaxed loss function to enable more flexible learning and integrate Deep Q-Learning principles to optimize the expected returns. Our experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate that the proposed GNN-based method achieves a higher average yield with significantly reduced computational time compared to traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of using GNNs for solving optimization problems in finance and provides a promising approach for real-time arbitrage detection in dynamic financial markets.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents Do Not Replicate Human Market Traders: Evidence From Experimental Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave in a classic experimental finance paradigm widely known for eliciting bubbles and crashes in human participants. We adapt an established trading design, where traders buy and sell a risky asset with a known fundamental value, and introduce several LLM-based agents, both in single-model markets (all traders are instances of the same LLM) and in mixed-model "battle royale" settings (multiple LLMs competing in the same market). Our findings reveal that LLMs generally exhibit a "textbook-rational" approach, pricing the asset near its fundamental value, and show only a muted tendency toward bubble formation. Further analyses indicate that LLM-based agents display less trading strategy variance in contrast to humans. Taken together, these results highlight the risk of relying on LLM-only data to replicate human-driven market phenomena, as key behavioral features, such as large emergent bubbles, were not robustly reproduced. While LLMs clearly possess the capacity for strategic decision-making, their relative consistency and rationality suggest that they do not accurately mimic human market dynamics.</description>

      <title>A New Traders' Game? -- Empirical Analysis of Response Functions in a Historical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traders on financial markets generate non-Markovian effects in various ways, particularly through their competition with one another which can be interpreted as a game between different (types of) traders. To quantify the market mechanisms, we empirically analyze self-response functions for pairs of different stocks and the corresponding trade sign correlators. While the non-Markovian dynamics in the self-responses is liquidity-driven, it is expectation-driven in the cross-responses which is related to the emergence of correlations. We empirically study the non-stationarity of these responses over time. In our previous data analysis, we only investigated the crisis year 2008. We now considerably extend this by also analyzing the years 2007, 2014 and 2021. To improve statistics, we also work out averaged response functions for the different years. We find significant variations over time revealing changes in the traders' game.</description>
