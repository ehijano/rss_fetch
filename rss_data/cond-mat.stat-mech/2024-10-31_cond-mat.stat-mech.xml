      <title>Exact Potts/Tutte Polynomials for Hammock Chain Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact calculations of the $q$-state Potts model partition functions and the equivalent Tutte polynomials for chain graphs comprised of $m$ repeated hammock subgraphs $H_{e_1,...,e_r}$ connected with line graphs of length $e_g$ edges, such that the chains have open or cyclic boundary conditions (BC). Here, $H_{e_1,...,e_r}$ is a hammock (series-parallel) subgraph with $r$ separate paths along ``ropes'' with respective lengths $e_1, ..., e_r$ edges, connecting the two end vertices. We denote the resultant chain graph as $G_{\{e_1,...,e_r\},e_g,m;BC}$. We discuss special cases, including chromatic, flow, and reliability polynomials. In the case of cyclic boundary conditions, the zeros of the Potts partition function in the complex $q$ function accumulate, in the limit $m \to \infty$, onto curves forming a locus ${\cal B}$, and we study this locus.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\alpha^\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\beta=\alpha/2$.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform asymmetric exclusion process: Stationary densities and domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the stationary densities in totally asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP) with open boundary conditions and spatially inhomogeneous hopping rates. We calculate the steady state density profiles that characterise the associated phases. We show that in the contrast to the low and high density phases, the stationary density profile in the maximal current phase can be discontinuous, even when the space-dependent hopping rate is continuous. The phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters show universal topology. The associated phase transitions are explored. We further investigate the domain walls, which are delocalised and calculate their envelops, which reveal their dependence on the spatial nonuniformity of the hopping rates.</description>

      <title>Scaling of diffusion constants in perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has witnessed substantial progress, due to the development and application of sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, infinite-temperature magnetization transport has turned out to range from ballistic, over superdiffusive, to diffusive behavior in different parameter regimes of the anisotropy. Since integrability is rather the exception than the rule, a crucial question is the change of transport under integrability-breaking perturbations. This question includes the stability of superdiffusion at the isotropic point and the change of diffusion constants in the easy-axis regime. In our work, we study this change of diffusion constants by a variety of methods and cover both, linear response theory in the closed system and the Lindblad equation in the open system, where we throughout focus on periodic boundary conditions. In the closed system, we compare results from the recursion method to calculations for finite systems and find evidence for a continuous change of diffusion constants over the full range of perturbation strengths. In the open system weakly coupled to baths, we find diffusion constants in quantitative agreement with the ones in the closed system in a range of nonweak perturbations, but disagreement in the limit of weak perturbations. Using a simple model in this limit, we point out the possibility of a diverging diffusion constant in such an open system.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hybrid Continuous-Discrete Ground-State Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for a hybrid continuous-discrete algorithm that integrates continuous-time deterministic dynamics with Metropolis-Hastings steps to combine search dynamics with and without detailed balance. Our purpose is to study the non-equilibrium dynamics that leads to the ground state of rugged energy landscapes in this general setting. Our results show that MH-driven dynamics reach ``easy'' ground states faster, indicating a stronger bias in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the algorithm with reversible transition probabilities. To validate this, we construct a set of Ising problem instances with a controllable bias in the energy landscape that makes one degenerate solution more accessible than another. The constructed hybrid algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in convergence and ground-state sampling accuracy, achieving a 100x speedup on GPUs compared to simulated annealing, making it well-suited for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Force-current structure in Markovian open quantum systems and its applications: geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition and thermodynamic trade-off relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Physical Meaning of Principal Component Analysis for Lattice Systems with Translational Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek for the physical implication of principal component analysis (PCA) applied to lattice systems with phase transitions, especially when the system is translationally invariant. We present a general approximate formula for a principal component as well as all other eigenvalues and argue that the approximation becomes exact if the size of data is infinite. The formula explains the connection between the principal component and the corresponding order parameter and, therefore, the reason why PCA is successful. Our result can also be used to estimate a principal component without performing matrix diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Rotation-induced phase transition in planar continuous helicity gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics of an ideal gas of classical particles with continuous helicity in three-dimensional Minkowski space. Using the one-particle distribution function for a particle with continuous helicity, we obtain expressions for the chemical potential, angular momentum, and entropy of the gas. We show that such a system placed in a rotating container can be in two phases: rotating and non-rotating. We describe the conditions for the phase transition and examine the phase diagram of the gas. It is found that at low angular velocities, the rotating phase can exist only in the form of metastable states. A feature of metastable states with low angular velocities is a negative angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Laplace Universality in Correlated Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transport processes across materials like glasses, living cells, and porous media, the probability density function of displacements exhibits exponential decay rather than Gaussian behavior. We show that this universal behavior of rare events, termed Laplace tails, emerges even when correlations and memory affect the dynamics. Using a renormalization-based approach, we demonstrate that correlations and memory do not suppress these tails but rather enhance their visibility, even at short timescales. The developed analytical framework refines the concept of correlations for rare events and enables the computation of effective parameters that govern Laplace tails in correlated processes. These findings suggest that correlations can serve as a tunable parameter to control the behavior of rare events in transport.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Entropy Production in Non-Equilibrium Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23205v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ultrafast thermodynamics framework to model heat generation and entropy production in laser-driven ferromagnetic systems. By establishing a connection between the magnetic field strength of the laser pulse and magnetization dynamics we model time-dependent entropy production rates and deduce the associated heat dissipation in epitaxial and polycrystalline FeNi and CoFeB thin films. Our theoretical predictions are validated by comparison to experimental magnetization dynamics data, shedding light on thermodynamic processes on picosecond timescales. Crucially, we incorporate recently observed inertial spin dynamics, to describe their impact on heat generation in pump-probe experiments. As such, this formalism provides novel insights into controlling heat production in magnetic systems, and contributes to advancing the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in magnetic systems, with implications for future experimental protocols in spintronics and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Chapman-Enskog theory for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable systems feature an infinite number of conserved charges and on hydrodynamic scales are described by generalised hydrodynamics (GHD). This description breaks down when the integrability is weakly broken and sufficiently large space-time-scales are probed. The emergent hydrodynamics depends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on nearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number, momentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann collision approach to integrability breaking we describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with collision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using Chapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. We recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity and thermal conductivity, which are given by generalizations of Chapman-Enskog integral equations. We also observe that the diffusion of quasiparticles introduces an additional small parameter enriching the structure of the expansion as compared to the standard Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Proof of nonintegrability of the spin-$1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-$1$ chain models have been extensively studied in condensed matter physics, significantly advancing our understanding of quantum magnetism and low-dimensional systems, which exhibit unique properties compared to their spin-$1/2$ counterparts. Despite substantial progress in this area, providing a rigorous proof of nonintegrability for the bilinear-biquadratic chain model remains an open challenge. While integrable solutions are known for specific parameter values, a comprehensive understanding of the model's general integrability has been elusive. In this paper, we present the first rigorous proof of nonintegrability for the general spin-$1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain models. Our proof not only confirms the nonintegrability of widely studied models but also extends to offer deeper insights into several areas. These include the unification of nonintegrability proofs using graph theoretical methods and the identification of the absence of local conserved quantities in quantum many-body scar systems with perfect fidelity revivals, such as the AKLT model. This work marks a significant step toward understanding the complex dynamics of spin-$1$ systems and offers a framework that can be applied to a broader class of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy is Elastic Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present universal relations between entanglement entropy, which quantifies the quantum correlation between subsystems, and the elastic cross section, which is the primary observable for high energy particle scattering, by employing a careful formulation of wave packets for the incoming particles. For 2-to-2 elastic scattering with no initial entanglement and subdividing the system along particle labels, we show that both the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies in the final states are directly proportional to the elastic cross section in unit of the transverse size for the initial wave packets, which is then interpreted as the elastic scattering probability. The relations do not depend on the underlying dynamics of the quantum field theory and are valid to all orders in coupling strengths. Furthermore, computing quantum correlations between momentum and non-kinematic data leads to entanglement entropies expressed as various semi-inclusive elastic cross sections. Our result gives rise to a novel ``area law'' for entanglement entropy in a two-body system.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\text{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\text{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\text{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Exact renormalization group flow for matrix product density operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix product density operator (MPDO) provides an efficient tensor network representation of mixed states on one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We study a real-space renormalization group transformation of MPDOs represented by a circuit of local quantum channels. We require that the renormalization group flow is exact, in the sense that it exactly preserves the correlation between the coarse-grained sites and is therefore invertible by another circuit of local quantum channels. Unlike matrix product states (MPS), which always have a well-defined isometric renormalization transformation, we show that general MPDOs do not necessarily admit a converging exact renormalization group flow. We then introduce a subclass of MPDOs with a well-defined renormalization group flow, and show the structure of the MPDOs in the subclass as a representation of a pre-bialgebra structure. As a result, such MPDOs obey generalized symmetry represented by matrix product operator algebras associated with the pre-bialgebra. We also discuss implications with the classification of mixed-state quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Exact volume-law entangled eigenstates in a large class of spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Multiplectoneme Phases in DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23145v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stretched DNA molecule which is also under- or overwound, undergoes a buckling transition forming intertwined looped domains called plectonemes. Here we develop a simple theory that extends the two-phase model of stretched supercoiled DNA, allowing for the coexistence of multiple plectonemic domains by including positional and length distribution entropies. Such a multiplectoneme phase is favored in long DNA molecules in which the gain of positional entropy compensates for the cost of nucleating a plectoneme along a stretched DNA segment. Despite its simplicity, the developed theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the twistable wormlike chain model. The theory predicts more plectonemes than experimentally observed, which we attribute to the limited resolution of experimental data. Since plectonemes are detected through fluorescence signals, those shorter than the observable threshold are likely missed.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Slow Relaxation in a Glassy Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits have become a powerful tool in the study of many-body quantum physics, providing insights into both fast-thermalizing chaotic and non-thermalizing integrable many-body dynamics. In this work, we explore a distinct intermediate class - glassy quantum systems - where thermalization occurs, but over very long timescales. We introduce and analyze a Floquet random quantum circuit that can be tuned between glassy and fully ergodic behavior through a single adjustable parameter. This circuit can be understood as the unitary analog of the block Rosenzweig-Porter model, which is defined by a Hamiltonian. Using an effective field theory for random quantum circuits, we analyze the correlations between quasienergy eigenstates and thereby determine the time evolution of the disorder-averaged density matrix. In the intermediate regime the circuit displays a two-step thermalization process: an initial relaxation within weakly coupled sectors followed by a later, global thermalization. We also show that the ramp of the spectral form factor is enhanced by a factor of the number of sectors in the glassy regime, and at early times in the intermediate regime. These results indicate that quantum circuits provide an ideal platform for the exploration of nontrivial thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems, offering deeper insights into quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Certified algorithms for quantum Hamiltonian learning via energy-entropy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a quantum system from estimates of Gibbs-state expectation values. Various methods for achieving this task were proposed recently, both from a practical and theoretical point of view. On the one hand, some practical algorithms have been implemented and used to analyze experimental data but these algorithms often lack correctness guarantees or fail to scale to large systems. On the other hand, theoretical algorithms with provable asymptotic efficiency guarantees have been proposed, but they seem challenging to implement. Recently, a semidefinite family of Hamiltonian learning algorithms was proposed which was numerically demonstrated to scale well into the 100-qubit regime, but provided no provable accuracy guarantees. We build on this work in two ways, by extending it to provide certified a posteriori lower and upper bounds on the parameters to be learned, and by proving a priori convergence in the special case where the Hamiltonian is commuting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a loop optimization algorithm based on nuclear norm regularization for tensor network. The key ingredient of this scheme is to introduce a rank penalty term proposed in the context of data processing. Compared to standard variational periodic matrix product states method, this algorithm can circumvent the local minima related to short-ranged correlation in a simpler fashion. We demonstrate its performance when used as a part of the tensor network renormalization algorithms [S. Yang, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 110504 (2017)] for the critical 2D Ising model. The scale invariance of the renormalized tensors is attained with higher accuracy while the higher parts of the scaling dimension spectrum are obtained in a more stable fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of achieving the maximum power in microscopic thermal engines has gained increasing attention in recent studies of stochastic thermodynamics. We employ the optimal control theory to study the performance of Brownian heat engines and determine the optimal heat-engine cycles in generic damped situation, which were previously known only in the overdamped and the underdamped limits. These optimal cycles include two isothermal processes, two adiabatic processes, and an extra isochoric relaxation process at the upper stiffness constraint. Our results not only interpolate the optimal cycles between the overdamped and the underdamped limits, but also determine the appropriate friction coefficient of the Brownian heat engine to achieve the maximum power. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of high-performance Brownian heat engines in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Long-Ranged Influence of an Inclusion in Momentum-Conserving Active Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an inclusion placed inside a dilute Stokesian suspension of microswimmers induces power-law number-density modulations and flows. These take a different form depending on whether the inclusion is held fixed by an external force, for example an optical tweezer, or if it is free. When the inclusion is held in place, the far-field fluid flow is a Stokeslet, while the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^{2+\epsilon}$, with $r$ the distance from the inclusion, and $\epsilon$ an anomalous exponent which depends on the symmetry of the inclusion and varies continuously as a function of a dimensionless number characterizing the relative amplitudes of the convective and diffusive effects. The angular dependence takes a non-trivial form which depends on the same dimensionless number. When the inclusion is free to move, the far-field fluid flow is a stresslet and the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^2$ with a simple angular dependence. These long-range modulations mediate long-range interactions between inclusions that we characterize.</description>

      <title>Graph theoretical proof of nonintegrability in quantum many-body systems : Application to the PXP model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rigorous proof of integrability or non-integrability in quantum many-body systems is among the most challenging tasks, as it involves demonstrating the presence or absence of local conserved quantities and deciphering the complex dynamics of the system. In this paper, we establish a graph-theoretical analysis as a comprehensive framework for proving the non-integrability of quantum systems. Exemplifying the PXP model, which is widely believed to be non-integrable, this work rigorously proves the absence of local conserved quantities, thereby confirming its non-integrability. This proof for the PXP model gives several important messages not only that the system is non-integrable, but also the quantum many body scaring observed in the model is not associate with the existence of local conserved quantities. From a graph-theoretical perspective, we also highlight its advantage, even in integrable systems, as the classification of local conserved quantities can be achieved by simply counting the number of isolated loops in the graphs. Our new approach is broadly applicable for establishing proofs of (non-)integrability in other quantum many-body systems, significantly simplifying the process of proving nonintegrability and giving numerous potential applications.</description>

Abstract: We set up and study the hydrodynamic theory for active fluid and tethered membranes. We focus on inversion-symmetric membranes. We show that for some choices of the activity parameter, such membranes are stable and described by appropriate linear hydrodynamic equations, which are exact in the asymptotic long wavelength limit, giving stable flat phases with positional quasi long range orders. For other choices of the activity parameter, the system is linearly unstable, implying crumpling of the membranes. We argue that in such an active membrane thermal noises dominate over any active noises, and use those to calculate the correlation functions of the undulation and in-plane displacements of the membrane in the stable case, and the associated correlation functions of the embedding bulk flow velocities.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>A new quadrature for the generalized hydrodynamics equation and absence of shocks in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional fluids, it is well known that Euler-scale equations are plagued by ambiguities and instabilities. Smooth initial conditions may develop shocks, and weak solutions, such as for domain wall initial conditions (the paradigmatic Riemann problem of hydrodynamics), are not unique. The absence of shock formation experimentally observed in quasi-one-dimensional cold-atomic gases, which are described by the Lieb-Liniger model, provides perhaps the strongest pointer to a modification of the hydrodynamic equation due to integrability. Generalised hydrodynamics (GHD) is the required hydrodynamic theory, taking into account the infinite number of conserved quantities afforded by integrability. We provide a new quadrature for the GHD equation -- a solution in terms of a Banach fixed-point problem where time has been explicitly integrated. In the Lieb-Liniger model, this allows us to rigorously show for the first time that, from a wide class of initial conditions including zero- and finite-entropy states, no shock may appear at all times, and weak solutions are unique and entropy-preserving. This extends known results for finite-component linearly-degenerate hydrodynamics, to the continuum of hydrodynamic modes present in GHD. The new quadrature is also an efficient solution tool, which, combined with recent hydrodynamic fluctuation theories, gives rise to new expressions for correlations in non-stationary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a computer code for the thermodynamic hierarchical equations of motion derived from a spin subsystem coupled to multiple Drude baths at different temperatures, which are connected to or disconnected from the subsystem as a function of time. The code can simulate the reduced dynamics of the subsystem under isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic conditions. The extensive and intensive thermodynamic variables are calculated as physical observables, and Gibbs and Helmholtz energies are evaluated as intensive and extensive work. The energy contribution of the system--bath interaction is evaluated separately from the subsystem using the hierarchical elements of the HEOM. The accuracy of the calculated results for the equilibrium distribution and the two-body correlation functions are assessed by contrasting the results with those obtained from the time-convolution-less Redfield equation. It is shown that the Lindblad master equation is inappropriate for thermodynamic description of a spin--boson system. Non-Markovian effects in thermostatic processes are investigated by sequentially turning on and off the baths at different temperatures with different switching times and system--bath coupling. In addition, the Carnot cycle is simulated under quasi-static conditions. To analyze the work done for the subsystem in the cycle, thermodynamic work diagrams are plotted as functions of intensive and extensive variables. The C++ source codes are provided as supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</description>

      <title>Aubry transition with small distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when the Aubry transition occurs in incommensurately distorted structures, the amplitude of the distortions is not necessarily large as suggested by the standard Frenkel-Kontorova mechanical model. By modifying the shape of the potential in such a way that the mechanical force is locally stronger (i.e. increasing the nonlinearities), the transition may occur at a small amplitude of the potential with small distortions. A "phason" gap then opens, while the phonon spectrum resembles a standard undistorted spectrum at higher energies. This may explain the existence of pinned phases with small distortions as experimentally observed in charge-density waves.</description>

      <title>A simple intelligent adaptive network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For real-world complex system constantly enduring perturbation, to achieve survival goal in changing yet unknown environments, the central problem is constantly adapting themself to external environments according to environmental feedback. Such adaptability is considered the nature of general intelligence. Inspired by thermodynamics, we develop a self-adaptive network utilizing only macroscopic information to achieve desired landscape through reconfiguring itself in unknown environments. By continuously estimating environment entropy, our network can adaptively realize desired landscape represented by topological measures. Our network achieves adaptation under several scenarios, including confinement on phase space and geographic constraint. A unique power law distinguishes our network from memoryless systems. Furthermore, our simple strategy could enable brain network and communication network to adaptively maintain essential topological characteristics. Compared to data-driven methods, our self-adaptive network is understandable without careful choice of learning architectures and parameters. Our self-adaptive network could help to understand adaptive intelligence through the lens of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Replica analysis of entanglement properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a systematic analysis of the properties of entanglement entropy in curved backgrounds using the replica approach. We explore the analytic $(q-1)$ expansion of R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ and its variations; our setup applies to generic variations, from symmetry transformations to variations of the background metric or entangling region. Our methodology elegantly reproduces and generalises results from the literature on entanglement entropy in different dimensions, backgrounds, and states. We use our analytic expansions to explore the behaviour of entanglement entropy in static black hole backgrounds under specific scaling transformations, and we explain why this behaviour is key to determining whether there are islands of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Boltzmann machine learning of ground-state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a novel quantum circuit construction that combines classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test, thus overcoming a key obstacle to quantum Boltzmann machine learning that has been left open since [Amin et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021050 (2018)]. Additionally supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</description>
