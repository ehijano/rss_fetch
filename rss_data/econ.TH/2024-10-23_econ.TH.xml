      <title>Note on Bubbles Attached to Real Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational bubble is a situation in which the asset price exceeds its fundamental value defined by the present value of dividends in a rational equilibrium model. We discuss the recent development of the theory of rational bubbles attached to real assets, emphasizing the following three points. (i) There exist plausible economic models in which bubbles inevitably emerge in the sense that all equilibria are bubbly. (ii) Such models are necessarily nonstationary but their long-run behavior can be analyzed using the local stable manifold theorem. (iii) Bubbles attached to real assets can naturally and necessarily arise with economic development. Finally, we present a model with stocks and land, and show that bubbles in aggregate stock and land prices necessarily emerge.</description>

      <title>Commitment and Randomization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When does a Sender, in a Sender-Receiver game, strictly value commitment? In a setting with finite actions and finite states, we establish that, generically, Sender values commitment if and only if he values randomization. In other words, commitment has no value if and only if a partitional experiment is optimal under commitment. Moreover, if Sender's preferred cheap-talk equilibrium necessarily involves randomization, then Sender values commitment. We also ask: how often (i.e., for what share of preference profiles) does commitment have no value? For any prior, any independent, atomless distribution of preferences, and any state space: if there are $\left|A\right|$ actions, the likelihood that commitment has no value is at least $\frac{1}{\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}}$. As the number of states grows large, this likelihood converges precisely to $\frac{1}{\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}}$.</description>

      <title>Strategic Irreversible Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies oligopolistic irreversible investment with closed-loop strategies. These permit fully dynamic interactions that result in much richer strategic behavior than previous studies with open-loop strategies allow. The tradeoff between preemption incentives and the option value of waiting becomes distinctly visible. Strategies that depend on present capital stocks enable credible reactions that deter from excessive preemption and support positive option values in equilibrium. Simpler strategies lead into a "preemption trap" with perfectly competitive outcome and zero net present values. To obtain these results, a novel concept of Markov perfect equilibrium is developed that copes with optimal investment taking the form of singular control.</description>

      <title>On Regularity and Normalization in Sequential Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comment on the regularity assumptions in the multi-agent sequential screening model of Eso and Szentes (2007). First, we observe that the regularity assumptions are not invariant to relabeling each agent's signal realizations. Second, we show that the regularity assumptions rule out valuation distributions with common bounded support. Third, we show that if each signal realization is labeled to equal the expected valuation, then the regularity assumptions imply that each agent's valuation is equal to his signal realization plus independent mean-zero noise.</description>

      <title>Gains-from-Trade in Bilateral Trade with a Broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bilateral trade with a broker, where a buyer and seller interact exclusively through the broker. The broker strategically maximizes her payoff through arbitrage by trading with the buyer and seller at different prices. We study whether the presence of the broker interferes with the mechanism's gains-from-trade (GFT) achieving a constant-factor approximation to the first-best gains-from-trade (FB).
  We first show that the GFT achieves a $1 / 36$-approximation to the FB even if the broker runs an optimal posted-pricing mechanism under symmetric agents with monotone-hazard-rate distributions. Beyond posted-pricing mechanisms, even if the broker uses an arbitrary incentive-compatible (IC) and individually-rational (IR) mechanism that maximizes her expected profit, we prove that it induces a $1 / 2$-approximation to the first-best GFT when the buyer and seller's distributions are uniform distributions with arbitrary support. This bound is shown to be tight.
  We complement such results by proving that if the broker uses an arbitrary profit-maximizing IC and IR mechanism, there exists a family of problem instances under which the approximation factor to the first-best GFT becomes arbitrarily bad. We show that this phenomenon persists even if we restrict one of the buyer's or seller's distributions to have a singleton support, or even in the symmetric setting where the buyer and seller have identical distributions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evidence Disclosure: Delay the Good to Accelerate the Bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamic tradeoff between generating and disclosing evidence. Agents are tempted to delay investing in a new technology in order to learn from information generated by the experiences of others. This informational free-riding is collectively harmful as it slows down learning and innovation adoption. A welfare-maximizing designer can delay the disclosure of previously generated information in order to speed up adoption. The optimal policy transparently discloses bad news and delays good news. This finding resonates with regulation demanding that fatal breakdowns be reported promptly. The designer's intervention makes all agents better off.</description>
