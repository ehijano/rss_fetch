      <title>Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.</description>

      <title>Empirical formula for charge state distribution of projectile ions through solid targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge state distributions (CSDs) of the projectile ions through gaseous or solid targets in the energy range of tandem accelerators (1 MeV/u &lt; E &lt; 5 MeV/u) have a major impact on ion-atom collision and accelerator physics. Theoretically it is possible to generate the CSDs for up to Ni-like ions, but empirical models have no such bounds. In the recent decades, the mean charge states are mostly obtained from an empirical formula [Schiwietz et al., Nucl. Inst. Meths. 225, 4(2004)]. But no description on CSDs is found there. To estimate the CSDs, we have used Gaussian distribution function having distribution width given by [Novikov and Teplove, Phys. Lett. 378, 1286(2014)]. The results obtained have been compared with the experimentally measured CSDs for the heavy projectile ions. The merits and demerits of such empirical formulae have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Momentum and Matter Matter for Axion Dark Matter Matters on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of matter effects to searches for axion Dark Matter on Earth. The finite momentum of axion Dark Matter is crucial to elucidating the effects of Earth on both the axion Dark Matter field value and its gradient. We find that experiments targeting axion couplings compatible with canonical solutions of the strong CP puzzle are likely not affected by Earth's matter effects. However, experiments sensitive to lighter axions with stronger couplings can be significantly affected, with a significant part of the parameter space suffering from a reduced axion field value, and therefore decreased experimental sensitivity. In contrast, the spatial gradient of the axion field can be enhanced along Earth's radial direction, with important implications for ongoing and planned experiments searching for axion Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>Blinking optical tweezers for atom rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient approach for holding and rearranging an N x M atom array using only N optical tweezers. This is achieved through the sequential release and recapture of M single atoms by a single optical tweezer. By employing a stroboscopic harmonic potential, the phase-space quadrature of the atom's probability distribution can be maintained under this "blinking" potential, provided the trap frequency meets the appropriate conditions. Proof-of-principle experiments confirm that a blinking tweezer can trap M atoms while requiring only 1 / M of the power per atom, and it can even facilitate rearrangement, demonstrated with arrays of up to M = 9 atoms. This method offers a scalable and reconfigurable platform for optical tweezer arrays, crucial for the preparation and manipulation of large-scale qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark-broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as invaluable tools, offering \textit{idealized experiments} with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. Importantly, the procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. As a result, our simulations naturally and accurately incorporate the effects of both strong collisions and electron capture phenomena on spectral line broadening.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation thermometry of an atom-resolved quantum gas: Beyond the fluctuation-dissipation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermometry is essential for studying many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Accurately measuring low temperatures in these systems, however, remains a significant challenge due to the absence of a universal thermometer. Most widely applicable methods, such as fitting of in-situ density profiles or standard fluctuation thermometry, are limited by the requirement of global thermal equilibrium and inapplicability to homogeneous systems. In this work, we introduce a novel in-situ thermometry for quantum gases, leveraging single-atom resolved measurements via quantum gas microscopy, and demonstrate it on an ideal Fermi gas. By analyzing number fluctuations in probe volumes with approximately one atom on average, we extract both global and local temperatures over a broad dynamic range. Unlike traditional fluctuation thermometry, our method does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and is based instead on the exact relationship between number fluctuations and density-density correlations. In the low-temperature regime, it allows us to observe significant deviations from fluctuation-dissipation predictions, uncovering sub-extensive fluctuations. Our method is applicable to systems with arbitrary trapping potentials, requiring neither precise trap calibration nor global thermal equilibrium. This nearly universal thermometer for quantum gases overcomes key limitations of existing techniques, paving the way for more accurate and versatile temperature measurements in ultracold quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent radiative lifetime measurement of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of sodium molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02691</link>

Abstract: We report the measurement of radiative lifetimes of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of gas-phase molecular sodium using a high-resolution double-resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were done using a time-correlated photon counting technique at various pressures and temperatures. Lifetimes were extracted from extrapolations to the zero buffer gas pressure, called Stern-Volmer plot, and the temperature-dependence of the radiative lifetimes were measured over a temperature range from 593 K to 653 K. Our result agrees well within the error limits with the theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Suppression of motional dephasing using state mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg-mediated quantum optics is a useful route toward deterministic quantum information processing based on single photons and quantum networks, but is bottlenecked by the fast motional dephasing of Rydberg atoms. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate suppressing the motional dephasing by creating an {\it a priori} unknown but correct phase to each Rydberg atom in an atomic ensemble. The phase created is exactly proportional to the unknown velocity of the thermal motion, resulting in a condition as if no thermal motion occurs to the Rydberg atom upon the retrieval of the signal photon. Our experiments, though hampered by the noise of lasers and the environment, demonstrate more than one order of magnitude enhancement of the coherence time. The feasibility of realizing long-lived storage of single photons in strongly interacting Rydberg media sheds new light on Rydberg-mediated quantum nonlinear optics.</description>
