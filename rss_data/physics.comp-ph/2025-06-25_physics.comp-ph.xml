      <title>Exploring the Capabilities of the Frontier Large Language Models for Nuclear Energy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation, and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities, and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks. However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.</description>

      <title>STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator (STACIE): Robust and accurate transport properties from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: STACIE (STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator) is a novel algorithm and Python package that delivers robust, uncertainty-aware estimates of autocorrelation integrals from time-correlated data. While its primary application is deriving transport properties from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, STACIE is equally applicable to time-correlated data in other scientific fields. A key feature of STACIE is its ability to provide robust and accurate estimates without requiring manual adjustment of hyperparameters. Additionally, one can follow a simple protocol to prepare sufficient simulation data to achieve a desired relative error of the transport property. We demonstrate its application by estimating the ionic electrical conductivity of a NaCl-water electrolyte solution. We also present a massive synthetic benchmark dataset to rigorously validate STACIE, comprising 15360 sets of time-correlated inputs generated with diverse covariance kernels with known autocorrelation integrals. STACIE is open source and available on GitHub and PyPI, with comprehensive documentation and examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present resolvent4py, a parallel Python package for the analysis, model reduction and control of large-scale linear systems with millions or billions of degrees of freedom. This package provides the user with a friendly Python-like experience (akin to that of well-established libraries such as numpy and scipy), while enabling MPI-based parallelism through mpi4py, petsc4py and slepc4py. In turn, this allows for the development of streamlined and efficient Python code that can be used to solve several problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, graph theory, molecular dynamics and several other fields.</description>

      <title>Simulating acoustically-actuated flows in complex microchannels using the volume penalization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a volume penalization technique for simulating acoustically-actuated flows in geometrically complex microchannels. Using a perturbation approach, the nonlinear response of an acoustically-actuated compressible Newtonian fluid moving over obstacles or flowing in a geometrically complex domain is segregated into two sub-problems: a harmonic first-order problem and a time-averaged second-order problem, where the latter utilizes forcing terms and boundary conditions arising from the first-order solution. This segregation results in two distinct volume penalized systems of equations. The no-slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface is enforced by prescribing a zero structure velocity for the first-order problem, while spatially varying Stokes drift -- which depends on the gradient of the first-order solution -- is prescribed as the structure velocity for the second-order problem. The harmonic first-order system is solved via MUMPS direct solver, whereas the steady state second-order system is solved iteratively using a novel projection method-based preconditioner. The preconditioned iterative solver for the second-order system is demonstrated to be highly effective and scalable with respect to increasing penalty force and grid resolution, respectively. A novel contour integration technique to evaluate the acoustic radiation force on an immersed object is also proposed. Through test cases featuring representative microfluidic geometries, we demonstrate excellent agreement between the volume penalized and body-fitted grid. We also identify suitable penalty factors and interfacial smearing widths to accurately capture the first- and second-order solutions. These results provide first-of-its-kind empirical evidence of the efficacy of the volume penalization method for simulating acoustic streaming problems that have so far been analyzed using body-fitted methods in literature.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic effect in high order harmonic generation revealed by a fully analytical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully analytical method for describing high-order harmonic generation (HHG). This method is based on the strong-field approximation (SFA) and utilizes the perturbation expansion method. Specifically, we expand the laser-induced dipole moment to third-order analytical expansion (TAE) and fifth-order expansion (FAE) with respect to the Keldysh parameter $\gamma$. The TAE method is suitable for $\gamma\leqslant0.27$, while the FAE method can be applied for $\gamma\leqslant 0.65$. We demonstrate that higher-order perturbation terms capture the nonadiabatic effect, while the zero-order term represents the adiabatic effect. Furthermore, we reveal that the nonadiabatic effect influences HHG intensity by impacting electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>Solver Performance of Accelerated MoM for Connected Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating and developing large rectangularly shaped arrays with equidistant interspacing is challenging as the computational complexity grows quickly with array size. However, the geometrical shape of the array, appropriately meshed, leads to a multilevel Toeplitz structure in the RWG-based Method of Moment impedance matrix representation that can be used to mitigate the increased complexity. This paper develops, presents and compares two different accelerated solvers that both utilize the matrix structure to determine antenna properties. Both methods use a novel mesh-partitioning algorithm and its associated data representation, reducing storage and computational costs. The first solver is an iterative method based on multilevel fast Fourier transform to accelerate matrix multiplications. The second solver approach is based on an extension of a fast direct Toeplitz solver, adapted to a block-matrix structure. This fast direct solver is demonstrated to have close to machine epsilon accuracy. Both accelerated methods are evaluated on two different array element types, for arrays with up to 900 elements. The results are compared with conventional direct and iterative matrix solvers. Improvements are seen in both the time and required storage to solve the problem. The choice of the most efficient method depends on the residual thresholds in the iterative method, geometry of the element and frequency. Two different preconditioners for the iterative method are investigated to evaluate their performance. The two accelerated methods vastly outperform regular matrix inversion methods.</description>

      <title>How to use quantum computers for biomolecular free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PyMoosh, a Python-based simulation library designed to provide a comprehensive set of numerical tools allowing to compute essentially all optical characteristics of multilayered structures, ranging from reflectance and transmittance to guided modes and photovoltaic efficiency. PyMoosh is designed not just for research purposes, but also for use-cases in education. To this end, we have invested significant effort in ensuring user-friendliness and simplicity of the interface. PyMoosh has been developed in line with the principles of Open Science and taking into account the fact that multilayered structures are increasingly being used as a testing ground for optimization and deep learning approaches. We provide in this paper the theoretical basis at the core of PyMoosh, an overview of its capabilities, as well as a comparison between the different numerical methods implemented in terms of speed and stability. We are convinced such a versatile tool will be useful for the community in many ways.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic environment is key to realizing magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems for medical diagnostics. In this work, a simulation model is established to quantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface in a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to particle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape created by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a homogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is adapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the magnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the assumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially clarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential for diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison to experimental results validates our simulation approach.</description>

      <title>LT-PINN: Lagrangian Topology-conscious Physics-informed Neural Network for Boundary-focused Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs), including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2) LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>
