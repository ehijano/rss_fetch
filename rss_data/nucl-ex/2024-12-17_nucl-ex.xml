      <title>Nuclear structure and direct reaction studies in particle-$\gamma$ coincidence experiments at the FSU John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its foundation in the 1960s, the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory at Florida State University (FSU) pursued research at the forefront of nuclear science. In this contribution, we present recent highlights from nuclear structure and reaction studies conducted at the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory, also featuring the general experimental capabilities at the laboratory for particle-$\gamma$ coincidence experiments. Specifically, we focus on light-ion induced reactions measured with the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SE-SPS) and the CATRiNA neutron detectors, respectively. Some results obtained with the CeBrA demonstrator for particle-$\gamma$ coincidence experiments at the SE-SPS are presented. A highlight from the first experimental campaigns with the combined CLARION2-TRINITY setup, showing that weak reaction channels can be selected, is discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Isotopic Transparency in Central Xe+Sn Collisions at 100 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method, based on comparing isotopic yield ratios measured at forward and sideward polar angles and on cross-bombarding heavy nuclei with different neutron-to-proton ratios, is used to quantify the stopping power in heavy-ion collisions. For central collisions of isotopically separated $^{124,129}$Xe+$^{112,124}$Sn at 100~MeV/nucleon bombarding energy, measured with the 4$\pi$ multidetector INDRA at GSI, a moderate transparency is deduced for hydrogen isotopes, whereas for heavier fragmentation products with atomic number $Z \ge 3$ a high transparency exceeding 50\% is observed. An anomalously large transparency is found for alpha particles, and possible explanations are presented.</description>

      <title>The evidence of $N=16$ shell closure and $\beta$-delayed neutron emission from $^{25}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the $\beta$-delayed neutron emission from $^{25}$F for the first time at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). Using combined neutron and $\gamma$-ray detector systems of the FRIB Decay Station Initiator (FDSi), we observed $\beta$-decay transitions populating neutron unbound states between 4.2 and 8 MeV in $^{25}$Ne. The experimental results led to the revision of the $\beta$-decay half-life and $\beta$-delayed neutron-emission probability of $^{25}$F. The $\beta$-decay strength distribution of $^{25}$F extracted from the data agrees with the shell-model predictions using the USDB and SDPF-M effective interactions. This result indicates that the spherical neutron $N = 16$ shell gap persists in $^{25}$F and $^{25}$Ne.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium-like states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomonium-like" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</description>

      <title>Likelihood of a zero in the proton elastic electric form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with the $29$ available data on the ratio of proton electric and magnetic form factors, $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/ G_M^p(Q^2)$, and independent of any model or theory of strong interactions, we use the Schlessinger point method to objectively address the question of whether the ratio possesses a zero and, if so, its location. Our analysis predicts that, with 50% confidence, the data are consistent with the existence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 10.37\,$GeV$^2$. The level of confidence increases to $99.9$\% on $Q^2 \leq 13.06\,$GeV$^2$. Significantly, the likelihood that existing data are consistent with the absence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 14.49\,$GeV$^2$ is $1/1$-million.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the fission-like fragments in the $^{12}$C + $^{208}$Pb system at E$^{\star}$ $\approx$ 31.8--45.4 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the cross-sections of 25 fission-like fragments within the mass range 76$\leq$A$\leq$141, expected to be populated via fission of moderately excited compound nucleus produced as a result of complete and/or incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{208}$Pb reaction at E$_{\rm lab}$ = 81.9 and 75.8 MeV, have been measured using activation technique followed by offline $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. The yields of different fission-like fragments have been analyzed to generate isotopic and isobaric yield distributions. The value of the mass dispersion parameter, $\sigma^2_A$, is found to be 2.93 and 2.65 for Antimony (Sb) isotope at excitation energy E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 and 39.6 MeV, and 1.24 for Indium (In) isotope at E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 MeV. The charge dispersion parameter $\sigma_Z$ for Sb is estimated to be 0.769 and 0.714 at E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 and 39.6 MeV, respectively. For In isotopes, the value of $\sigma_Z$ is estimated to be 0.430 at E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 MeV. The value of mass and charge dispersion parameters for Sb and In isotopes have been found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the literature for similar systems. The mass distribution of fission-like fragments is found to be fitted with a Gaussian function, except for a few data points, indicating their population via compound nucleus fission. Further, the mass variance ($\sigma^2_M$) displays linear increment with an increase in excitation energy. Two medically important isotopes, $^{99m}$Tc and $^{111}$In, are populated in this system, suggesting a potential formation route.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <title>Novel features of asymmetric nuclear matter from terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb by the PREX Collaboration suggests a large value of the nuclear symmetry energy slope parameter, $L$, whereas the smaller $L$ is preferred to account for the small neutron-star radii from NICER observations. To resolve this discrepancy between nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, new effective interactions have been developed using relativistic mean-field models with the isoscalar- and isovector-meson mixing. We investigate the effects of $\delta$-nucleon coupling and $\sigma$--$\delta$ mixing on the ground-state properties of finite nuclei, as well as the characteristics of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and neutron stars. Additionally, we explore the role of the quartic $\rho$-meson self-interaction in dense nuclear matter to mitigate the stiff equation of state for neutron stars resulting from the large $\delta$-nucleon coupling. It is found that the nuclear symmetry energy undergoes a sudden softening at approximately twice the saturation density of nuclear matter, taking into account the PREX-2 result, the recent NICER observation of PSR J0437$-$4715, and the binary neutron star merger, GW170817.</description>
