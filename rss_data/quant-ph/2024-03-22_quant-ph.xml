      <title>Exact solution for the collective non-Markovian decay of two fully excited quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous decay of a quantum emitter can be significantly affected by both, the state of other emitters and the state of the surrounding radiation. Such instances combine two central topics in quantum optics that are typically treated separately: collective decay and non-Markovian dynamics. Here we access collective non-Markovian decay through the exact solution for two excited quantum emitters located at adjacent unit cells of a one-dimensional single-band waveguide. The transformed field amplitudes, which we express in terms of elementary functions, combine exponential, algebraic, fractional, and mixed algebraic-exponential decay, as well as logarithmic corrections to some of the algebraic parts. We develop analytic methods for multiparticle open quantum systems that shed light on the complexity of non-linear quantum optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Second Moment of Hafnians in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling is a popular method for experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage, but many subtleties remain in fully understanding its theoretical underpinnings. An important component in the theoretical arguments for approximate average-case hardness of sampling is anticoncentration, which is a second-moment property of the output probabilities. In Gaussian Boson Sampling these are given by hafnians of generalized circular orthogonal ensemble matrices. In a companion work [arXiv:2312.08433], we develop a graph-theoretic method to study these moments and use it to identify a transition in anticoncentration. In this work, we find a recursive expression for the second moment using these graph-theoretic techniques. While we have not been able to solve this recursion by hand, we are able to solve it numerically exactly, which we do up to Fock sector $2n = 80$. We further derive new analytical results about the second moment. These results allow us to pinpoint the transition in anticoncentration and furthermore yield the expected linear cross-entropy benchmarking score for an ideal (error-free) device.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians via commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is arguably the most fundamental application of quantum computers. The Magnus operator is a popular method for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation in computational mathematics, yet its usage requires the implementation of exponentials of commutators, which has previously made it unappealing for quantum computing. The development of commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators (CFQMs) circumvents this obstacle, at the expense of a lack of provable global numeric error bounds. In this work, we establish one such error bound for CFQM-based time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian simulation by carefully estimating the error of each step involved in their definition. This allows us to compare its cost with the alternatives, and show that CFQMs are often the most efficient product-formula technique available by more than an order of magnitude. As a result, we find that CFQMs may be particularly useful to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced shallow circuits and absence of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.</description>

      <title>dc atomtronic quantum interference device: quantum superposition of persistent-current states and a parity-protected qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized Bose-Hubbard model in a two-mode approximation is applied to study the rotational dynamics of a direct-current atomtronic quantum interference device. Modified values of on-site interaction and pair-tunneling parameters of the Hamiltonian, derived from the small-oscillation periods of the Josephson modes, are shown to provide an excellent agreement to the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation results for the whole rotational frequency range, reaching also the critical values of imbalance and current. This amounts to a full validation of the semiclassical approximation of the modified Hamiltonian, whose quantization is employed to investigate the quantum features of the stationary states. Focusing on the frequency interval where the potential energy presents two minima, it is shown that the central frequency, at which such minima are symmetric, yields an atom number parity-protected qubit with a maximum entanglement of both persistent-current states, similar to those of superconducting circuits threaded by a half-quantum of applied flux. Such a parity protection scheme survives within a small interval around the central frequency, which sets the minimum rotational frequency precision that should be required to implement the qubit. It is found that such a maximum admissible error in the frequency determination turns out to be inversely proportional to the qubit quality factor that measures the gap between the qubit energy levels and the following levels. It is shown that the chemical potential or condensate particle number could be employed as suitable control parameters to achieve the best trade-off between such qubit characteristics.</description>

      <title>Linearized analysis of dissipative Two Axis Counter Twisting (TACT) squeezing for Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze two axis twisting in the presence of depolarizing channel dissipation. We find that spin squeezing is only possible if the dissipation is parametrically weaker than the squeezing coupling. Squeezing may be used for meteorologically useful decrease of spin noise but only in the case where the squeezing occurs before measurement, in the case one squeezes as one measures one also squeezes the signal thereby making spin squeezing ineffective for metrological gain. The key mathematical advance made in this work is the observation that TACT in the presence of depolarizing noise is equivalent to TACT with reduced polarization and no noise. We find an exponential gain in signal to noise with the exponent proportional to the ratio between the squeezing strength and the depolarization rate.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Quantum Distributed Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nondeterministic distributed computing was recently introduced as dQMA (distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur) protocols by Fraigniaud, Le Gall, Nishimura and Paz (ITCS 2021). In dQMA protocols, with the help of quantum proofs and local communication, nodes on a network verify a global property of the network. Fraigniaud et al. showed that, when the network size is small, there exists an exponential separation in proof size between distributed classical and quantum verification protocols, for the equality problem, where the verifiers check if all the data owned by a subset of them are identical. In this paper, we further investigate and characterize the power of the dQMA protocols for various decision problems.
  First, we give a more efficient dQMA protocol for the equality problem with a simpler analysis. This is done by adding a symmetrization step on each node and exploiting properties of the permutation test, which is a generalization of the SWAP test. We also show a quantum advantage for the equality problem on path networks still persists even when the network size is large, by considering ``relay points'' between extreme nodes.
  Second, we show that even in a general network, there exist efficient dQMA protocols for the ranking verification problem, the Hamming distance problem, and more problems that derive from efficient quantum one-way communication protocols. Third, in a line network, we construct an efficient dQMA protocol for a problem that has an efficient two-party QMA communication protocol.
  Finally, we obtain the first lower bounds on the proof and communication cost of dQMA protocols. To prove a lower bound on the equality problem, we show any dQMA protocol with an entangled proof between nodes can be simulated with a dQMA protocol with a separable proof between nodes by using a QMA communication-complete problem introduced by Raz and Shpilka (CCC 2004).</description>

      <title>Unconditional verification of quantum computation with classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verification of quantum computation is a task to efficiently check whether an output given from a quantum computer is correct. Existing verification protocols conducted between a quantum computer to be verified and a verifier necessitate quantum communication to unconditionally detect any malicious behavior of the quantum computer solving any promise problem in ${\sf BQP}$. In this paper, we remove the necessity of the communication of qubits by proposing a "physically-classical" verification protocol in which the verifier just sends coherent light to the quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Projective squeezing for translation symmetric bosonic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of translation symmetric bosonic codes, e.g., Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill and squeezed cat codes, is robust against photon loss, but the computation accuracy is limited by the available squeezing level. Here, we introduce the \textit{projective squeezing} (PS) method for computing outcomes for a higher squeezing level by revealing that a linear combination of displacement operators with periodic displacement values constitutes the smeared projector onto the better code space; we also show the analytical relationship between the increased squeezing level and the projection probability. We introduce concrete implementation methods for PS based on linear-combination-of-unitaries and virtual quantum error detection. We also numerically verify our analytical arguments and show that our protocol can mitigate the effect of photon loss.</description>

      <title>Direct Probe of Topology and Geometry of Quantum States on IBM Q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of topology and geometry are of critical importance in exploring exotic phases of quantum matter. Though they have been investigated on various experimental platforms, to date a direct probe of topological and geometric properties on a universal quantum computer even for a minimum model is still in vain. In this work, we first show that a density matrix form of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) can be explicitly re-constructed from Pauli operator measurements on a quantum circuit. We then propose two algorithms, suitable for IBM quantum computers, to directly probe QGT. The first algorithm is a variational quantum algorithm particularly suitable for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era devices, whereas the second one is a pure quantum algorithm based on quantum imaginary time evolution. Explicit results obtained from IBM Q simulating a Chern insulator model are presented and analysed. Our results indicate that transmon qubit-based universal quantum computers have the potential to directly simulate and investigate topological and geometric properties of a quantum system.</description>

Abstract: We show that a Bose--Einstein Condensate illuminated by a far off-resonant optical pump field and its retroreflection from a feedback mirror can produce stable, localised structures known as optomechanical droplets. We show that these droplets could be used to measure the acceleration of a BEC via continuous monitoring of the position of the droplet via the optical intensity distribution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Second-Order Rates for Quantum Information Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the standard quantum information decoupling, in which Alice aims to decouple her system from the environment by local operations and discarding some of her systems. To achieve an $\varepsilon$-decoupling with trace distance as the error criterion, we establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization for the largest dimension of the remainder system in terms of the conditional $(1-\varepsilon)$-hypothesis-testing entropy. When the underlying system is independent and identically prepared, our result leads to the matched second-order rate as well as the matched moderate deviation rate. As an application, we find an achievability bound in entanglement distillation protocol, where the objective is for Alice and Bob to transform their quantum state to maximally entangled state with largest possible dimension using only local operations and one-way classical communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide multi-player quantum data hiding based on nonlocal quantum state ensembles arising from multi-party quantum state discrimination. Using bounds on local minimum-error discrimination of multi-party quantum states, we construct a multi-player quantum data-hiding scheme. Our data-hiding scheme can be used to hide multiple bits, asymptotically, unless all the players collaborate. We also illustrate our results by examples of nonlocal quantum state ensembles.</description>

      <title>Krylov localization as a probe for ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning With a Limited Number Of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit partitioning is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that aims to simulate large quantum systems on smaller quantum computers. The quantum computation is divided into smaller circuits and results of measurements on these circuits are combined using classical processing. Current approaches involve performing the Hadamard test or SWAP test and thus require an ancillary qubit with full qubit-connectivity. In this study, we show that for certain quantum states and observables, the approach can be realized by performing simple measurements of expectation values. However, this comes with a limitation on the applicable space of quantum states and observables. The approach was demonstrated in the realm of quantum machine learning, specifically to the digits dataset. When applied to the classification between the digits 3 and 6, we were able to generalize to out-of-sample data with an accuracy of $100 \%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the minimal communication needed for the quantum channel simulation is a fundamental task in the quantum information theory. In this paper, we show that, under the purified distance, the quantum channel simulation can be directly achieved via quantum state splitting without using a technique known as the de Finetti reduction, and thus provide a pair of tighter one-shot bounds. Using the bounds, we also recover the quantum reverse Shannon theorem in a much simpler way.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods for Quantum Optimal Control: Artificial Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantum state preparation is one of the main challenges in achieving the quantum advantage. Furthermore, classically, for multi-level problems, our ability to solve the corresponding quantum optimal control problems is rather limited. The ability of the latter to feed into the former may result in significant progress in quantum computing. To address this challenge, we propose a formulation of quantum optimal control that makes use of artificial boundary conditions for the Schr\"odinger equation in combination with spectral methods. The resulting formulations are well suited for investigating periodic potentials and lend themselves to direct numerical treatment using conventional methods for bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Maximal $\alpha$-Leakage for Quantum Privacy Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, maximal $\alpha$-leakage is introduced to quantify how much a quantum adversary can learn about any sensitive information of data upon observing its disturbed version via a quantum privacy mechanism. We first show that an adversary's maximal expected $\alpha$-gain using optimal measurement is characterized by measured conditional R\'enyi entropy. This can be viewed as a parametric generalization of K\"onig et al.'s famous guessing probability formula [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 55(9), 2009]. Then, we prove that the $\alpha$-leakage and maximal $\alpha$-leakage for a quantum privacy mechanism are determined by measured Arimoto information and measured R\'enyi capacity, respectively. Various properties of maximal $\alpha$-leakage, such as data processing inequality and composition property are established as well. Moreover, we show that regularized $\alpha$-leakage and regularized maximal $\alpha$-leakage for identical and independent quantum privacy mechanisms coincide with $\alpha$-tilted sandwiched R\'enyi information and sandwiched R\'enyi capacity, respectively.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect and the non-Hermitian skin effect have both been used to explain the localization of eigenmodes near system boundaries, though the former is arguably more accurate in some regimes due to its incorporation of quantum jumps. However, these frameworks predominantly focus on weak Markovian interactions, neglecting the potentially crucial role of memory effects. To address this, we investigate, utilizing the powerful hierarchical equations of motion method, how a non-Markovian environment can modify the Liouvillian skin effect. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian environment can induce not only a ``thick skin effect", where the skin mode broadens and shifts into the bulk, but also skin-mode coherence, leading to the coherence-delocalization and oscillatory relaxation with a characteristic linear scaling with system size. Remarkably, both the skin-mode and steady-state coherence exhibit resistance to decoherence from additional environmental noise. These findings highlight the profound impact of system-bath correlations on relaxation and localization, revealing unique phenomena beyond conventional Markovian approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Lie quandles} as the minimal mathematical structure needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is based on the notion of a quandle used primarily in knot theory, whose main defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y \triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$. We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of Lie algebras. We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the same form of self-distributivity.</description>

      <title>Loss-induced quantum nonreciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribute to their robustness against loss and external noise, nonreciprocal photonic devices hold great promise for applications in quantum information processing. Recent advancements have demonstrated that nonreciprocal optical transmission in linear systems can be achieved through the strategic introduction of loss. However, a crucial question remains unanswered: can loss be harnessed as a resource for generating nonreciprocal quantum correlations? Here, we take a counterintuitive stance by engineering loss to generate a novel form of nonreciprocal quantum correlations, termed nonreciprocal photon blockade. We examine a dissipative three-cavity system comprising two nonlinear cavities and a linear cavity. The interplay of loss and nonlinearity leads to a robust nonreciprocal single- and two-photon blockade, facilitated by destructive quantum interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of this nonreciprocal photon blockade by manipulating the relative phase between the two nonlinear cavities. Remarkably, this allows for the reversal of the direction of nonreciprocity. Our study not only sheds new light on the concept of loss-engineered quantum nonreciprocity but also opens up a unique pathway for the design of quantum nonreciprocal photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Cooling Algorithm for Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge. With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size, as long as the initial state is prepared in a low energy sector of polynomial size. We achieve the latter via a fast, quasi-adiabatic sweep from a parameter regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We generalize the algorithm to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>$^{13}$C Hyperpolarization with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Micro- and Nanodiamonds for Sensitive Magnetic Resonance Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the $^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation ($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers. By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation, the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100 nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems. Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy IQP Circuits with Constant Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling from the output distributions of quantum computations comprising only commuting gates, known as instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) computations, is believed to be intractable for classical computers, and hence this task has become a leading candidate for testing the capabilities of quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP circuit undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise, whose depth is greater than a critical $O(1)$ threshold, the output distribution can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum supremacy tasks, we do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture, on anti-concentration properties, nor do we require $\Omega(\log(n))$ circuit depth. We take advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of diagonal gates, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a large-scale breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest that quantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more susceptible to classical simulation than previously thought.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles, which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of ``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems, invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense). While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely, Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the construction of holographic principles we discuss.</description>

      <title>A quantum picture of light-suppressed photosynthetic charge transfer: Photo-blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of photochemistry in plants under varying light environments. We employ a three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that under steady and coherent driving of light, the efficiency of charge transfer is inversely proportional to the intensity of incident light, which can be suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on photosynthetic electron transport. These results are analyzed to gain insight in the light responses of photosynthetic parameters. We discuss the implications of thermal fluctuation in the light source used in photochemical experiments, and argue that in high light conditions, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture renders a consistent interpretation of a wide range of experiments, including plastocyanin-dependent electron transport in photosystem I, biphasic redox kinetics of P700 and wavelength-dependent quantum yields, and provides a donor-side scheme for the onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$ (characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p&lt;p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium quantum heat transport between structured environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the $\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties of thermal environments.</description>

      <title>On scrambling, tomperature and superdiffusion in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates basic properties of the de Sitter static patch using simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".</description>

      <title>Prospects for the determination of fundamental constants with beyond-state-of-the-art uncertainty using molecular hydrogen ion spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level $v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass ratios two orders smaller than CODATA 2018, and without using muonic hydrogen data. For the Rydberg constant and the charge radii, improvements by factors of 4 to 11 are projected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution. The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins.</description>

      <title>Optical Bias and Cryogenic Laser Readout of a Multipixel Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic opto-electronic interconnects are gaining increasing interest as a means to control and read out cryogenic electronic components. The challenge is to achieve sufficient signal integrity with low heat load processing. In this context, we demonstrate the opto-electronic bias and readout of a commercial four-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array using a cryogenic photodiode and laser. We show that this approach has a similar system detection efficiency to a conventional bias. Furthermore, multi-pixel detection events are faithfully converted between the optical and electrical domain, which allows reliable extraction of amplitude multiplexed photon statistics. Our device has a passive heat dissipation of 2.6mW, maintains the signal rise time of 3ns, and operates in free-running (self-resetting) mode at a repetition rate of 600kHz. This demonstrates the potential of high-bandwidth, low noise, and low heat load opto-electronic interconnects for scalable cryogenic signal processing and transmission.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold deeply-bound molecules via multi-state chainwise coincident pulses technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and, it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective control of atomic coherence with cold atoms has made atom interferometry an essential tool for quantum sensors and precision measurements. The performance of these interferometers is closely related to the operation of large wave packet separations. We present here a novel approach for atomic beam splitters based on the stroboscopic stabilization of quantum states in an accelerated optical lattice. The corresponding Floquet state is generated by optimal control protocols. In this way, we demonstrate an unprecedented Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) interferometer, with a momentum separation of 600 photon recoils ($600\hbar k$) between its two arms. Each LMT beam splitter is realized in a remarkably short time (2 ms) and is highly robust against the initial velocity dispersion of the wave packet and lattice depth fluctuations. Our study shows that Floquet engineering is a promising tool for exploring new frontiers in quantum physics at large scales, with applications in quantum sensing and testing fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Tensor network compressibility of convolutional models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent one of the most widely used neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, their size can be effectively reduced by "tensorization" while maintaining accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50 pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.</description>

      <title>Determination of principal axes orientation in an ion trap using matter-wave interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the control mechanism of trap frequencies and determine the orientation of ion trap principal axes. The application of DC voltage to the ground electrodes, commonly employed to finely tune trap frequencies in ion traps, leads to the rotation of the trap principal axes. Analyzing the ion matter-wave interference signal enables us to determine the directions of the trap principal axes. Both the experiments and simulations reveal an avoided-crossing behavior resulting from the coupling between the trap radial axes. Additionally, simulations indicate that symmetric trap structures lack this coupling, suggesting that trap structure asymmetry causes coupling between the axes. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into ion traps for diverse applications in quantum science and technology.</description>

Abstract: In this article we present comparisons between the spectrum of a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator for a particular periodic potential and for its restriction to a finite number of sites. We deduce from this finite, but large, number of sites, the Integrated Density of States (IDS) associated to the Hamiltonian operator whose derivate is the DOS. The exact formula for the IDS is given and the expression of the DOS is analytical. All our calculations are done on the particular periodic Airy-potential, which is a new case for which one has an analytical expression of the DOS. It is a continuous, periodic potential, piecewise affine. As a periodic operator, the spectrum is a band spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish approximate rigidity results for boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games. In particular, we show that near-perfect quantum strategies are approximate representations of the corresponding BCS algebra in the little Frobenius norm. Likewise, for the class of XOR nonlocal games, we show that near-optimal quantum strategies are approximate representations of the corresponding *-algebra associated with the game. In both cases, the norm of the approximate representations is independent of the quantum state employed in the strategy. We also show that approximate representations of the BCS (resp. XOR-algebra) are close to near-perfect (resp. near-optimal) quantum strategies employing a maximally entangled state for the corresponding game. As a corollary, any near-perfect BCS (resp. near-optimal XOR) quantum strategy is close to a near-perfect (resp. near-optimal) quantum strategy using a maximally entangled state. Lastly, we show that every synchronous algebra is *-isomorphic to a certain BCS algebra, allowing us to apply our results to the class of synchronous nonlocal games as well.</description>

Abstract: Recently it has been shown that transmon qubit architectures experience a transition between a many-body localized and a quantum chaotic phase. While it is crucial for quantum computation that the system remains in the localized regime, the most common way to achieve this has relied on disorder in Josephson junction parameters. Here we propose a quasi-periodic patterning of parameters as a substitute for random disorder. We demonstrate, using the Walsh-Hadamard diagnostic, that quasiperiodicity is more effective than disorder for achieving localization. In order to study the localizing properties of our new Hamiltonian for large, experimentally relevant system sizes, we use two complementary perturbation-theory schemes, one with respect to the many-body interactions and one with respect to hopping parameter of the free Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: The guesswork quantifies the minimum cost incurred in guessing the state of an ensemble, when only one state can be queried at a time. In the classical case, it is well known that the optimal strategy trivially consists of querying the states in their non-increasing order of posterior probability. In the quantum case, on the other hand, the most general strategy to obtain the optimal ordering in which to perform the queries consist of a quantum measurement. Here, we solve such an optimization problem by deriving the quantum measurement attaining the guesswork for a broad class of ensembles and cost functions.</description>

Abstract: The characterization of continuous-variable quantum states is crucial for applications in quantum communication, sensing, simulation and computing. However, a full characterization of multimode quantum states requires a number of experiments that grows exponentially with the number of modes. Here we propose an alternative approach where the goal is not to reconstruct the full quantum state, but rather to estimate its characteristic function at a given set of points. For multimode states with reflection symmetry, we show that the characteristic function at $M$ points can be estimated using only $O(\log M)$ copies of the state, independently of the number of modes. The number of copies can be further reduced to a constant when the characteristic function is known to be positive, as in the case of squeezed vacuum states. In these cases, the estimation is achieved by an experimentally friendly setup using only beamsplitters and homodyne measurements.</description>

Abstract: Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure, and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.</description>

Abstract: With the advent of digital and analog quantum simulation experiments, it is now possible to experimentally simulate dynamics of quantum many-body lattice systems and make site-resolved measurements. These experiments make it pertinent to consider the probability of getting any specific measurement outcome, which we call the `signal', on placing multiple detectors at various sites while simulating dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system. In this work, we formulate and investigate this problem, introducing the concept of quantum many-body detection probability (QMBDP), which refers to the probability of detecting a chosen signal at least once in a given time. We show that, on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters, there can be sharp transition from a regime where QMBDP $\approx 1$, to a regime, where QMBDP $\approx 0$. Most notably, the effects of such a transition can be observed at a single trajectory level. This is not a measurement-induced transition, but rather a non-equilibrium transition reflecting opening of a specific type of gap in the many-body spectrum. We demonstrate this in a single-impurity non-integrable model, where changing the many-body interaction strength brings about such a transition. Our findings suggest that instead of measuring expectation values, single-shot stroboscopic measurements could be used to observe non-equilibrium transitions.</description>

Abstract: We study whether a generic isolated quantum system initially set out of equilibrium can be considered as localized close to its initial state. Our approach considers the time evolution in the Krylov basis, which maps the dynamics onto that of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice where both the energy in the lattice sites and the tunneling from one lattice site to the next are inhomogeneous. By tying the dynamical propagation in the Krylov basis to that in the basis of microstates, we infer qualitative criteria to distinguish systems that remain localized close to their initial state from systems that undergo quantum thermalization. These criteria are system-dependent and involve the expectation values and standard deviations of both the coupling strengths between Krylov states and their energy. We verify their validity by inspecting two cases: Anderson localization as a function of dimension and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin system. We finally investigate the Wigner surmise and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which have both been proposed to characterize quantum chaotic systems. We show that when the average value of the non-diagonal terms in the Lanczos matrix is large compared to their fluctuations and to the fluctuations of the energy expectation values, which typically corresponds to delocalized quantum systems according to our criteria, there can be level repulsion of eigen-energies (also known as spectral rigidity), similar to that of the Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy levels; and we also demonstrate that in the same regime, the expectation values of typical local observables only weakly vary as a function of eigenstates, an important condition for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our demonstration assumes that, in the chaotic regime, the observable is sufficiently diagonal in the basis of Krylov states.</description>

Abstract: Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of non-commuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular, rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological order as 3D toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of 3D toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of two copies of 3D toric codes up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round. We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it with two copies of 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal implementation of the logical non-Clifford $CCZ$ gate. We also show that the coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is finite-depth-equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to 3D, which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the 3D fermionic toric code.</description>

      <title>Postselected communication over quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximation of Quantum Channel Fidelity Exploiting Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for a fixed output dimension of the quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in time polynomial with respect to the level of the hierarchy and input dimension. As a direct consequence of our result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an accuracy of $\epsilon$ in $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, \text{input dimension})$ time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Many-Body Quantum Dynamics via Local-Information Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear systems are important in many areas of modern science and technology. For example, nonlinearity plays an essential role in generating quantum mechanical states of both light and matter. As a result, there has been great interest in understanding the fundamental quantum nature of a variety of nonlinear effects. At the same time, there is currently a large gap between the classical and quantum understanding of nonlinear systems, with the classical understanding being far more developed. To close this gap, we introduce a general new theory which allows us to predict quantum effects in any nonlinear system purely in terms of its classical description. We demonstrate the predictions of our theory in experiments probing quantum fluctuations of intense femtosecond pulses propagating in an optical fiber undergoing soliton-fission supercontinuum generation, a process where broadband radiation is produced by a narrow-band input. Famously, this process is known to be highly noise-sensitive, leading to noisy outputs even from inputs with only quantum fluctuations. In contrast, our experiments uncovered a variety of previously hidden low-noise and noise-robust states arising from quantum correlations and entanglement, in agreement with the predictions of our theory. We also show how the theory points to new design concepts for controlling quantum noise in optics and beyond. We expect that our results will provide a template for discovering quantum effects in a wide variety of complex nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled photons (biphotons) in the time-frequency degree of freedom play a crucial role in both foundational physics and advanced quantum technologies. Fully characterizing them poses a key scientific challenge. Here, we propose a theoretical approach to achieving the complete tomography of biphotons by introducing a frequency shift in one arm of the combination interferometer. Our method, a generalized combination interferometer, enables the reconstruction of the full complex joint spectral amplitude associated with both frequency sum and difference in a single interferometer. In contrast, the generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel and N00N state interferometers only allow for the partial tomography of biphotons, either in frequency difference or frequency sum. This provides an alternative method for full characterization of an arbitrary two-photon state with exchange symmetry and holds potential for applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (EQNN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), juxtaposed against their classical counterparts: Equivariant Neural Networks (ENN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). We evaluate the performance of each network with two toy examples for a binary classification task, focusing on model complexity (measured by the number of parameters) and the size of the training data set. Our results show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ EQNN and the QNN provide superior performance for smaller parameter sets and modest training data samples.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation, we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Transition of Anticoncentration in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling is a promising method for experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage because it is easier to implement than other comparable schemes. While most of the properties of Gaussian Boson Sampling are understood to the same degree as for these other schemes, we understand relatively little about the statistical properties of its output distribution. The most relevant statistical property, from the perspective of demonstrating quantum advantage, is the anticoncentration of the output distribution as measured by its second moment. The degree of anticoncentration features in arguments for the complexity-theoretic hardness of Gaussian Boson Sampling, and it is also important to know when using cross-entropy benchmarking to verify experimental performance. In this work, we develop a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing the moments of the Gaussian Boson Sampling distribution. Using this framework, we show that Gaussian Boson Sampling undergoes a transition in anticoncentration as a function of the number of modes that are initially squeezed compared to the number of photons measured at the end of the circuit. When the number of initially squeezed modes scales sufficiently slowly with the number of photons, there is a lack of anticoncentration. However, if the number of initially squeezed modes scales quickly enough, the output probabilities anticoncentrate weakly.</description>

Abstract: Taking into account the importance of the unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity, and the existence of a minimal length of the order of the Planck scale, we consider a modified Schr\"odinger equation resulting from a generalized uncertainty principle, which finds applications from the realm of quantum information to large-scale physics, with a quantum mechanically corrected gravitational interaction proposed very recently. As the resulting equation cannot be solved by common exact approaches, we propose a Bethe ansatz approach, which will be applied and whose results we will discuss, commenting on the analogy of the present study with some other interesting physical problems.</description>

      <title>Bexcitonics: Quasi-particle approach to open quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quasiparticle approach to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary complexity based on the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). This is done by generalizing the HEOM dynamics and mapping it into that of the system in interaction with a few bosonic fictitious quasiparticles that we call bexcitons. Bexcitons arise from a decomposition of the bath correlation function into discrete features. Specifically, bexciton creation and annihilation couple the auxiliary density matrices in the HEOM. The approach provides a systematic strategy to construct exact quantum master equations that include the system-bath coupling to all orders even for non-Markovian environments. Specifically, by introducing different metrics and representations for the bexcitons it is possible to straightforwardly generate different variants of the HEOM, demonstrating that all these variants share a common underlying quasiparticle picture. Bexcitonic properties, while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated system-bath dynamics and its numerical convergence. For instance, we use it to analyze the instability of the HEOM when the bath is composed of underdamped oscillators and show that it leads to the creation of highly excited bexcitons. The bexcitonic picture can also be used to develop more efficient approaches to propagate the HEOM. As an example, we use the particle-like nature of the bexcitons to introduce mode-combination of bexcitons that uses the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree to efficiently propagate the HEOM dynamics.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the ground states of a class of classically hard Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the ground states of a class of classically hard Hamiltonians. The mechanism of the exponential speedup that appeared in our algorithm is different from all existing quantum algorithms. The idea is to introduce a mapping $f:\text{ }\rho\rightarrow |\rho\rangle$ to use density matrices to represent pure states. We show that this mapping makes sense by giving an efficient method to obtain the information of $|\rho\rangle$ from measurements on $\rho$. Under this mapping, the Lindblad master equation (LME) becomes a Schr\"odinger equation with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which contains natural imaginary time evolution. The steady state of the LME, therefore, corresponds to the ground state of $L^\dag L$ with $L$ the Liouvillian operator of the LME. We show the runtime of the LME has the $\mathcal{O}(log(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling with $\zeta$ the overlap between the initial state and the ground state compared with the $\mathcal{O}(poly(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling in other algorithms. The Hamiltonians $L^\dag L$ are guaranteed to be difficult for classical computers if we believe the simulation of LME is difficult. Further, for any given local Hamiltonian $H$ with known ground energy $E_0$, we give a polynomial-time classical procedure to judge and solve whether there exists $L$ such that $H-E_0=L^\dag L$. Later, We discuss and analyze several important aspects of the algorithm including the non-linear dynamics that appeared in the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic Casimir effect has a fermionic counterpart in topological insulators: Zero-point fluctuations of a massless Dirac fermion field mediate a force between magnetic scatterers. The Casimir force is insensitive to disorder that preserves the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone. The protection may be broken if the Dirac equation is discretized, and an exponential suppression of the Casimir effect will result if a gap opens at the Dirac point. Here we show how this lattice artefact may be avoided, by applying a recently developed local discretization of the Euclidean action that does not suffer from the fermion-doubling obstruction of local discretizations of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are highly susceptible to errors due to unintended interactions with their environment. It is crucial to correct these errors without gaining information about the quantum state, which would result in its destruction through back-action. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides information about occurred errors without compromising the quantum state of the system. However, the implementation of QEC has proven to be challenging due to the current performance levels of qubits -- break-even requires fabrication and operation quality that is beyond the state-of-the-art. Understanding how qubit performance factors into the success of a QEC code is a valuable exercise for tracking progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we present qec_code_sim, an open-source, lightweight Python framework for studying the performance of small quantum error correcting codes under the influence of a realistic error model appropriate for superconducting transmon qubits, with the goal of enabling useful hardware studies and experiments. qec_code_sim requires minimal software dependencies and prioritizes ease of use, ease of change, and pedagogy over execution speed. As such, it is a tool well-suited to small teams studying systems on the order of one dozen qubits.</description>

      <title>Interpreting symplectic linear transformations in a two-qubit phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the continuous Wigner function and for certain discrete Wigner functions, permuting the values of the Wigner function in accordance with a symplectic linear transformation is equivalent to performing a certain unitary transformation on the state. That is, performing this unitary transformation is simply a matter of moving Wigner-function values around in phase space. This result holds in particular for the simplest discrete Wigner function defined on a $d \times d$ phase space when the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ is odd. It does not hold for a $d \times d$ phase space if the dimension is even. Here we show, though, that a generalized version of this correspondence does apply in the case of a two-qubit phase space. In this case, a symplectic linear permutation of the points of the phase space, together with a certain reinterpretation of the Wigner function, is equivalent to a unitary transformation.</description>

Abstract: Optical scattering force is used to reduce the loading time of single atoms to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic transport with narrow velocity distribution. We also observe in real time that, when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our method can be employed to make atom-cavity experiments more efficient.</description>

Abstract: Quantum processors based on color centers in diamond are promising candidates for future large-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical interface, (relatively) high operating temperature, and high-fidelity operation. Similar to other quantum-computing platforms, the electrical interface required to control and read out such qubits may limit both the performance of the whole system and its scalability. To address this challenge, this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface and investigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a scalable architecture comprising a large number of identical unit cells. Among the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus is devoted to the generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and nuclear spins, because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability. Following the derived requirements, different system architectures, such as a qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most power efficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit Larmor frequency across the processor. As a result, a non-frequency-multiplexed, 1-mm$^2$ unit-cell architecture is proposed as the optimal solution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and 9 nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW average power consumption, thus establishing the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scale color-center quantum computers.</description>

      <title>All incompatible measurements on qubits lead to multiparticle Bell nonlocality</title>

Abstract: Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality, pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource. In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can always be certified in a device-independent manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study One Axis Twisting (OAT) spin squeezing for metrology in the presence of decoherence. We study Linbladian evolution in the presence of both T_1 and T_2 (longitudinal and transverse relaxation processes). We show that spin squeezing can be an effective way to improve metrological accuracy even in the presence of decoherence for OAT squeezing. We show our results are not sensitive to inhomogeneity of the squeezing strength of the many spin OAT Hamiltonian and that very general squeezed states do not have entanglement enhanced decoherence. We also extend the Kitagawa-Ueda OAT squeezing formula to finite polarization.</description>

      <title>Fast delivery of heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over 12km fiber through multiplexing enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributing quantum entanglement between distant parties is a significant but difficult task in quantum information science, as it can enable numerous applications but suffers from exponential decay in the quantum channel. Quantum repeater is one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. In a quantum repeater protocol, it is essential that the entanglement generation speed within each elementary link is faster than the memory decoherence rate, to enable the scale-up of the quantum repeater by connecting neighboring repeater segments. This stringent requirement has not been implemented over a fiber of metropolitan scale so far. As a step towards this challenging goal, in this work we experimentally realize multiplexing-enhanced generation of heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over a 12km fiber. We excite the memory modes in a multiplexed quantum memory successively to generate 280 pairs of atom-photon quantum correlations with a train of photonic time-bin pulses filling the long fiber. After successful detection of a heralding signal, the excited memory mode can be identified and retrieved into idler photons on demand with either fixed or variable storage time. With the multiplexing enhancement, the heralding rate of atom-photon correlation can reach 1.95kHz, and the ratio between the quantum correlation generation rate to memory decoherence rate can be improved to 0.46 for a fiber length of 12km, which is so far the best for long fiber length (&gt;10km) to our knowledge. This work therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of a large-scale quantum repeater network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of conservation laws on wormholes that are made traversable by a double trace deformation. After coupling the two asymptotic boundaries of a maximally extended $(d+1)$ dimensional black brane geometry with $U(1)$ conserved current operators, we find that the quantum matter stress-energy tensor of the corresponding bulk gauge fields in the hydrodynamic limit violates the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), rendering the wormhole traversable. Applying our results to axionic two-sided black hole solutions, we discuss how the wormhole opening depends on the charge diffusion constant, how this affects the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole, and possible implications for many-body quantum teleportation protocols involving conserved current operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical pumping is a technique for engineering atomic-sublevel population of desired atoms. We investigate the population evolution of Cesium atoms by employing Liouville equation. For this purpose, we apply a circularly polarized light at a frequency suitable for electronic transition from ground states to excited states and calculate the relaxation rate, repopulation, and population evolution of the Cesium Zeeman sublevels. For engineering the sublevel population after optical pumping, we employ a radiofrequency (RF) field and consider the effect of RF field in Liouville equation. With this approach, we are able to prepare desired distribution of the population in the atomic sublevels with high efficiency, which can be employed in different optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Activating non-Hermitian skin modes by parity-time symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics as it ensures real energies for stable experimental realization of non-Hermitian phenomena. In this work, we propose $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry as a paradigm for designing rich families of higher-dimensional non-Hermitian states with unique bulk, surface, hinge or corner dynamics. Through systematically breaking or restoring $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in different sectors of a system, we can selectively activate or manipulate the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in both the bulk and topological boundary states. Some fascinating phenomena include the directional toggling of the NHSE, and the flow of boundary states without chiral or dynamical pumping, developed from selective boundary NHSE. Our results extend richly into 3D or higher, with more sophisticated interplay with selective bulk and boundary NHSE and charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) symmetry. Based on non-interacting lattices, $\mathcal{PT}$-activated NHSEs can be observed in various optical, photonic, electric and quantum platforms that admit gain/loss and non-reciprocity.</description>

      <title>Graph theoretic analysis of three-terminal quantum dot thermocouples: Onsager relations and spin-thermoelectric effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified model for a three-terminal quantum thermocouple consisting of two strongly-coupled quantum dots. To elucidate spin-dependent Seebeck and Peltier effects, we employ a microscopic Hamiltonian and map the Lindblad master equation onto a quantum transition network, capturing the key working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum thermodynamic networks encompassing both Coulomb interaction and spin-flipping processes, lead to the emergence of spin-thermolectric effects. Using algebraic graph theory, we recover the phenomenological law of irreversible thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different basis from classical laws of irreversible thermodynamics relying on local equilibrium assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stacking of intrinsically magnetic van der Waals materials provides a fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We find no trace of the Schmid superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that resistors with no UV cutoff always yield a fully localized phase and we explain how previous works predicting an insulating state came to obtain a contrary result.</description>

      <title>A miniaturized magnetic field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Ongoing miniaturization calls for ever-smaller sensors maintaining good measurement performance. Here, we present a fully integrated mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor capable of $5.9\,\mathrm{nT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity utilizing $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ sized microdiamonds at a microwave power of $50\,\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15\,\mathrm{mW}$. A direct laser writing process is used to localize a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core by a polymer structure. This structure enables stable optical access and independent guiding of excitation and fluorescent light in different optical fibers. This separation strongly reduces the contribution of autofluorescence from the excitation light in the optical fiber. Moreover, a metallic direct laser written antenna structure is created next to the fibers' facet, allowing microwave manipulation of the NV centers' spins. The fabricated endoscopic sensor provides a robust platform with a tip diameter of $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$. The device enables remote optical and microwave access to perform the full range of coherent spin measurements with NV centers at a spatial resolution of $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>
