      <title>Some Computations for Optimal Execution with Monotone Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal execution problem in the infinite horizon setup. Our financial market is given by the Black-Scholes model with a linear price impact. The main novelty of the current note is that we study the constrained case where the number of shares and the selling rate are non-negative processes. For this case we give a complete characterization of the value and the optimal control via a solution of a non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Furthermore, we provide an example where the non-linear ODE can be solved explicitly. Our approach is purely probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional specific relative entropy between continuous martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuous time, the laws of martingales tend to be singular to each other. Notably, N. Gantert introduced the concept of specific relative entropy between real-valued continuous martingales, defined as a scaling limit of finite-dimensional relative entropies, and showed that this quantity is non-trivial despite the aforementioned mutual singularity of martingale laws.
  Our main mathematical contribution is to extend this object, originally restricted to one-dimensional martingales, to multiple dimensions. Among other results, we establish that Gantert's inequality, bounding the specific relative entropy with respect to Wiener measure from below by an explicit functional of the quadratic variation, essentially carries over to higher dimensions. We also prove that this lower bound is tight, in the sense that it is the convex lower semicontinuous envelope of the specific relative entropy. This is a novel result even in dimension one. Finally we establish closed-form expressions for the specific relative entropy in simple multidimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Bernoulli mixture models for credit portfolio risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents comparison results and establishes risk bounds for credit portfolios within classes of Bernoulli mixture models, assuming conditionally independent defaults that are stochastically increasing with a common risk factor. We provide simple and interpretable conditions for conditional default probabilities that imply a comparison of credit portfolio losses in convex order. In the case of threshold models, the ranking of portfolio losses is based on a pointwise comparison of the underlying copulas. Our setting includes as special case the well-known Gaussian copula model but allows for general tail dependencies, which are crucial for modeling credit portfolio risks. Moreover, our results extend the classical parameterized models, such as the industry models CreditMetrics and KMV Portfolio Manager, to a robust setting where individual parameters or the copula modeling the dependence structure can be ambiguous. A simulation study and a real data example under model uncertainty offer evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Non-Markov Market-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for an optimal market-making (MM) trading problem, specifically focusing on price processes with semi-Markov and Hawkes Jump-Diffusion dynamics. We begin by discussing the basics of RL and the deep RL framework used, where we deployed the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm for the deep learning part. The SAC algorithm is an off-policy entropy maximization algorithm more suitable for tackling complex, high-dimensional problems with continuous state and action spaces like in optimal market-making (MM). We introduce the optimal MM problem considered, where we detail all the deterministic and stochastic processes that go into setting up an environment for simulating this strategy. Here we also give an in-depth overview of the jump-diffusion pricing dynamics used, our method for dealing with adverse selection within the limit order book, and we highlight the working parts of our optimization problem. Next, we discuss training and testing results, where we give visuals of how important deterministic and stochastic processes such as the bid/ask, trade executions, inventory, and the reward function evolved. We include a discussion on the limitations of these results, which are important points to note for most diffusion models in this setting.</description>

      <title>The role of debt valuation factors in systemic risk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fragility of financial systems was starkly demonstrated in early 2023 through a cascade of major bank failures in the United States, including the second, third, and fourth largest collapses in the US history. The highly interdependent financial networks and the associated high systemic risk have been deemed the cause of the crashes. The goal of this paper is to enhance existing systemic risk analysis frameworks by incorporating essential debt valuation factors. Our results demonstrate that these additional elements substantially influence the outcomes of risk assessment. Notably, by modeling the dynamic relationship between interest rates and banks' credibility, our framework can detect potential cascading failures that standard approaches might miss. The proposed risk assessment methodology can help regulatory bodies prevent future failures, while also allowing companies to more accurately predict turmoil periods and strengthen their survivability during such events.</description>
