      <title>A propensity score weighting approach to integrate aggregated data in random-effect individual-level data meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evidence synthesis, collecting individual participant data (IPD) across eligible studies is the most reliable way to investigate the treatment effects in different subgroups defined by participant characteristics. Nonetheless, access to all IPD from all studies might be very challenging due to privacy concerns. To overcome this, many approaches such as multilevel modeling have been proposed to incorporate the vast amount of aggregated data from the literature into IPD meta-analysis. These methods, however, often rely on specifying separate models for trial-level versus patient-level data, which likely suffers from ecological bias when there are non-linearities in the outcome generating mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to combine aggregated data and IPD in meta-analysis that is free from ecological bias. The proposed approach relies on modeling the study membership given covariates, then using inverse weighting to estimate the trial-specific coefficients in the individual-level outcome model of studies without IPD accessible. The weights derived from this approach also shed insights on the similarity in the case-mix across studies, which is useful to assess whether eligible trials are sufficiently similar to be meta-analyzed. We evaluate the proposed method by synthetic data, then apply it to a real-world meta-analysis comparing the chance of response between guselkumab and adalimumab among patients with psoriasis.</description>

      <title>Variance-based sensitivity analysis in the presence of correlated input variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an extension of the classical Sobol' estimator for the estimation of variance based sensitivity indices. The approach assumes a linear correlation model between the input variables which is used to decompose the contribution of an input variable into a correlated and an uncorrelated part. This method provides sampling matrices following the original joint probability distribution which are used directly to compute the model output without any assumptions or approximations of the model response function.</description>

      <title>Spatial Deconfounding is Reasonable Statistical Practice: Interpretations, Clarifications, and New Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial linear mixed model (SLMM) consists of fixed and spatial random effects that can be confounded. Restricted spatial regression (RSR) models restrict the spatial random effects to be in the orthogonal column space of the covariates, which "deconfounds" the SLMM. Recent articles have shown that the RSR generally performs worse than the SLMM under a certain interpretation of the RSR. We show that every additive model can be reparameterized as a deconfounded model leading to what we call the linear reparameterization of additive models (LRAM). Under this reparameterization the coefficients of the covariates (referred to as deconfounded regression effects) are different from the (confounded) regression effects in the SLMM. It is shown that under the LRAM interpretation, existing deconfounded spatial models produce estimated deconfounded regression effects, spatial prediction, and spatial prediction variances equivalent to that of SLMM in Bayesian contexts. Furthermore, a general RSR (GRSR) and the SLMM produce identical inferences on confounded regression effects. While our results are in complete agreement with recent criticisms, our new results under the LRAM interpretation provide clarifications that lead to different and sometimes contrary conclusions. Additionally, we discuss the inferential and computational benefits to deconfounding, which we illustrate via a simulation.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery of Linear Non-Gaussian Causal Models with Unobserved Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider linear non-Gaussian structural equation models that involve latent confounding. In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but, in general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects. Instead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same observational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these causal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which often suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of latent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an algorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The algorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its latent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from the data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use rank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove asymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of latent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to overcomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Distribution-free Change-point Detection for Modern Data Based on a New Ranking Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Change-point detection (CPD) involves identifying distributional changes in a sequence of independent observations. Among nonparametric methods, rank-based methods are attractive due to their robustness and effectiveness and have been extensively studied for univariate data. However, they are not well explored for high-dimensional or non-Euclidean data. This paper proposes a new method, Rank INduced by Graph Change-Point Detection (RING-CPD), which utilizes graph-induced ranks to handle high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. The new method is asymptotically distribution-free under the null hypothesis, and an analytic $p$-value approximation is provided for easy type-I error control. Simulation studies show that RING-CPD effectively detects change points across a wide range of alternatives and is also robust to heavy-tailed distribution and outliers. The new method is illustrated by the detection of seizures in a functional connectivity network dataset, changes of digit images, and travel pattern changes in the New York City Taxi dataset.</description>

      <title>A new classification framework for high-dimensional data</title>

Abstract: Classification, a fundamental problem in many fields, faces significant challenges when handling a large number of features, a scenario commonly encountered in modern applications, such as identifying tumor subtypes from genomic data or categorizing customer attitudes based on online reviews. We propose a novel framework that utilizes the ranks of pairwise distances among observations and identifies consistent patterns in moderate- to high- dimensional data, which previous methods have overlooked. The proposed method exhibits superior performance across a variety of scenarios, from high-dimensional data to network data. We further explore a typical setting to investigate key quantities that play essential roles in our framework, which reveal the framework's capabilities in distinguishing differences in the first and/or second moment, as well as distinctions in higher moments.</description>

      <title>Contour Location for Reliability in Airfoil Simulation Experiments using Deep Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) outperform ordinary GPs as surrogate models of complex computer experiments when response surface dynamics are non-stationary, which is especially prevalent in aerospace simulations. Yet DGP surrogates have not been deployed for the canonical downstream task in that setting: reliability analysis through contour location (CL). In that context, we are motivated by a simulation of an RAE-2822 transonic airfoil which demarcates efficient and inefficient flight conditions. Level sets separating passable versus failable operating conditions are best learned through strategic sequential designs. There are two limitations to modern CL methodology which hinder DGP integration in this setting. First, derivative-based optimization underlying acquisition functions is thwarted by sampling-based Bayesian (i.e., MCMC) inference, which is essential for DGP posterior integration. Second, canonical acquisition criteria, such as entropy, are famously myopic to the extent that optimization may even be undesirable. Here we tackle both of these limitations at once, proposing a hybrid criterion that explores along the Pareto front of entropy and (predictive) uncertainty, requiring evaluation only at strategically located "triangulation" candidates. We showcase DGP CL performance in several synthetic benchmark exercises and on the RAE-2822 airfoil.</description>

      <title>Product Centered Dirichlet Processes for Dependent Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there is an immense literature on Bayesian methods for clustering, the multiview case has received little attention. This problem focuses on obtaining distinct but statistically dependent clusterings in a common set of entities for different data types. For example, clustering patients into subgroups with subgroup membership varying according to the domain of the patient variables. A challenge is how to model the across-view dependence between the partitions of patients into subgroups. The complexities of the partition space make standard methods to model dependence, such as correlation, infeasible. In this article, we propose CLustering with Independence Centering (CLIC), a clustering prior that uses a single parameter to explicitly model dependence between clusterings across views. CLIC is induced by the product centered Dirichlet process (PCDP), a novel hierarchical prior that bridges between independent and equivalent partitions. We show appealing theoretic properties, provide a finite approximation and prove its accuracy, present a marginal Gibbs sampler for posterior computation, and derive closed form expressions for the marginal and joint partition distributions for the CLIC model. On synthetic data and in an application to epidemiology, CLIC accurately characterizes view-specific partitions while providing inference on the dependence level.</description>

      <title>When Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived - somewhat naively - as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands. Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics - that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases - with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests. Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by a class of weighted linear statistics.</description>
