      <title>Higher categories of push-pull spans, II: Matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. In the first part we constructed a symmetric monoidal $(\infty, 3)$-category $\mathscr{CRW}$ of commutative Rozansky-Witten models with the goal of approximating the $3$-category of Kapustin and Rozansky. In this paper we extend work of Brunner, Carqueville, Fragkos, and Roggenkamp on the affine Rozansky-Witten models: we exhibit a functor connecting their $2$-category of matrix factorizations with the homotopy $2$-category of $\mathscr{CRW}$, and calculate the associated TFTs.</description>

      <title>More on soundness in the enriched context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working within enriched category theory, we further develop the use of soundness, introduced by Ad\'amek, Borceux, Lack, and Rosick\'y for ordinary categories. In particular we investigate: (1) the theory of locally $\Phi$-presentable $\mathcal V$-categories for a sound class $\Phi$, (2) the problem of whether every $\Phi$-accessible $\mathcal V$-category is $\Psi$-accessible, for given sound classes $\Phi\subseteq\Psi$, and (3) a notion of $\Phi$-ary equational theory whose $\mathcal V$-categories of models characterize algebras for $\Phi$-ary monads on $\mathcal V$.</description>

      <title>Orbital categories and weak indexing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of the poset $\mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing systems, consisting of composable collections of arities for $\mathcal{T}$-equivariant algebraic structures, where $\mathcal{T}$ is an orbital $\infty$-category, such as the orbit category of a finite group. In particular, we show that these are equivalent to weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing categories and characterize various unitality conditions.
  Within this sits a natural generalization $\mathrm{Index}_{\mathcal{T}} \subset \mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of Blumberg-Hill's indexing systems, consisting of arities for structures possessing binary operations and unit elements. We characterize the relationship between the posets of unital weak indexing systems and indexing systems, the latter remaining isomorphic to transfer systems on this level of generality. We use this to characterize the poset of unital $C_{p^n}$-weak indexing systems.</description>

      <title>Tricategorical Universal Properties Via Enriched Homotopy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of tricategorical limits and colimits, and show that they can be modelled up to biequivalence via certain homotopically well-behaved limits and colimits enriched over the monoidal model category $\mathbf{Gray}$ of $2$-categories and $2$-functors. This categorifies the relationship that bicategorical limits and colimits have with the so called `flexible' enriched limits in $2$-category theory. As examples, we establish the tricategorical universal properties of Kleisli constructions for pseudomonads, Eilenberg-Moore and Kleisli constructions for (op)monoidal pseudomonads, centre constructions for $\mathbf{Gray}$-monoids, and strictifications of bicategories and pseudo-double categories.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of module categories in the infinite and non-rigid settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By building on the notions of internal projective and injective objects in a module category introduced by Douglas, Schommer-Pries, and Snyder, we extend the reconstruction theory for module categories of Etingof and Ostrik. More explicitly, instead of algebra objects in finite tensor categories, we consider quasi-finite coalgebra objects in locally finite tensor categories. Moreover, we show that module categories over non-rigid monoidal categories can be reconstructed via lax module monads, which generalize algebra objects. For the category of finite-dimensional comodules over a (non-Hopf) bialgebra, we give this result a more concrete form, realizing module categories as categories of contramodules over Hopf trimodule algebras -- this specializes to our tensor-categorical results in the Hopf case. Using lax module functors we give a categorical proof of the variant of the fundamental theorem of Hopf modules which applies to Hopf trimodules. We also give a characterization of fusion operators for a Hopf monad as coherence cells for a module functor structure, using which we similarly reinterpret and reprove the Hopf-monadic fundamental theorem of Hopf modules due to Brugui\`eres, Lack, and Virelizier.</description>

      <title>The directed Vietoris-Rips complex and homotopy and singular homology groups of finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove analogues of classical results for higher homotopy groups and singular homology groups of pseudotopological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces are a generalization of (\v{C}ech) closure spaces which are in turn a generalization of topological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces also include graphs and directed graphs as full subcategories. Thus they are a bridge that connects classical algebraic topology with the more applied side of topology. More specifically, we show the existence of a long exact sequence for homotopy groups of pairs of pseudotopological spaces and that a weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for homology groups. Our main result is the construction of weak homotopy equivalences between the geometric realizations of directed Vietoris-Rips complexes and their underlying directed graphs. This implies that singular homology groups of finite directed graphs can be efficiently calculated from finite combinatorial structures, despite their associated chain groups being infinite dimensional. This work is similar to the work of McCord for finite topological spaces but in the context of pseudotopological spaces. Our results also give a novel approach for studying (higher) homotopy groups of discrete mathematical structures such as (directed) graphs or digital images.</description>

      <title>Metric completions of triangulated categories from finite dimensional algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study metric completions of triangulated categories in a representation-theoretic context. We provide a concrete description of completions of bounded derived categories of hereditary finite dimensional algebras of finite representation type. In order to investigate completions of bounded derived categories of algebras of finite global dimension, we define image and preimage metrics under a triangulated functor and use them to induce a triangulated equivalence between two completions. Furthermore, for a given metric on a triangulated category we construct a new, closely related good metric called the improvement and compare the respective completions.</description>

      <title>Central Hopf Monads and Braided Commutative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $ V$ be a braided tensor category and $ C$ a tensor category equipped with a braided tensor functor $G:V\to Z(C)$. For any exact indecomposable $C$-module category $M$, we explicitly construct a right adjoint of the action functor $\rho:Z^V(C)\to C^*_{M}$ afforded by $M$. Here $Z^V(C)$ is the M\"uger's centralizer of the subcategory $G(V)$ inside the center $Z^V(C)$, also known as the relative center. The construction is parallel to the one presented by K. Shimizu, but using instead the relative coend end. This adjunction turns out to be monadic, thus inducing Hopf monads $T_{V}: C\to C$, such that there is a monoidal equivalence of categories $ C_{T_{V}}\simeq Z^V(C).$ If $\bar{\rho}: C^*_{ M}\to Z^V(C)$ is the right adjoint of $\rho,$ then $\bar{\rho}(Id_{M})$ is the braided commutative algebra constructed in [R. Laugwitz and C. Walton. Braided commutative algebras over quantized enveloping algebras, Transform. Groups 26(3) (2021), 957--993]. As a consequence of our construction of these algebras, in terms of the right adjoint to $\rho$, we can provide a recipe to compute them when $C=Rep(H\# T)$ is the category of finite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra $H\# T$ obtained by bosonization, and choosing an arbitrary $Rep(H\# T)$-module category $M$. We show an explicit example in the case of Taft algebras.</description>

Abstract: We give a characterization, in terms of simplicial sets, of Frobenius objects in the category of relations. This result generalizes a result of Heunen, Contreras, and Cattaneo showing that special dagger Frobenius objects in the category of relations are in correspondence with groupoids. As an additional example, we construct a Frobenius object in the category of relations whose elements are certain cohomology classes in a compact oriented Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.</description>

      <title>Random Surfaces and Higher Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space of surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is equipped with natural horizontal and vertical concatenation operations, and we study representations of surfaces which preserve this algebraic structure. The framework of higher category theory allows us to formalize this notion in terms of a functor between double groupoids. We construct such functors by generalizing the classical concept of the path-ordered exponential as a nonabelian path integral. This generalization yields a notion of nonabelian surface integration, and is known in higher gauge theory as surface holonomy (or higher parallel transport). We extend these constructions from smooth surfaces to bounded controlled $p$-variation surfaces in the Young regime, with $p &lt; 2$. By focusing on surface holonomy valued in higher generalizations of the classical matrix groups, called matrix double groups, we obtain explicit computations for piecewise linear approximations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonabelian Stokes' and Fubini theorems to the Young regime. Finally, we use these matrix surface holonomy functors to construct characteristic functions for random surfaces such as fractional Brownian sheets with Hurst parameter $h&gt; \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the apparent incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces and we give some suggestions for future works.</description>
