      <title>Thom's gradient conjecture for nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R. Thom's gradient conjecture states that if a gradient flow of an analytic function converges to a limit, it does so along a unique limiting direction. In this paper, we extend and settle this conjecture in the context of infinite dimensional problems. Building on the foundational works of {\L}ojasiewicz, L. Simon, and the resolution of the conjecture for finite dimensional cases by Kurdyka-Mostowski-Parusinski, we focus on nonlinear evolutions on Riemannian manifolds as studied by L. Simon. This framework includes geometric PDEs such as minimal surface, harmonic map, mean curvature flow, and normalized Yamabe flow. Our main result not only confirms the uniqueness of the limiting direction but also characterizes the rate of convergence and possible limiting directions for both classical and infinite dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear steepest descent on a torus: A case study of the Landau-Lifshitz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain rigorous large time asymptotics for the Landau-Lifshitz equation in the soliton free case by extending the nonlinear steepest descent method to genus 1 surfaces. The methods presented in this paper pave the way to rigorous analysis of other integrable equations on the torus and enables asymptotic analysis on different regimes of the Landau-Lifshitz equation.</description>

Abstract: A unique inversion of the exponential X-ray transform of some class of symmetric 2-tensor field in a two dimensional strictly convex set is considered. The approach to inversion is based on the Cauchy problem for a Beltrami-like equation associated with $A$-analytic maps.</description>

      <title>Optimal stability of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev and Sobolev inequalities of arbitrary orders with dimension-dependent constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dolbeault-Esteban-Figalli-Frank-Loss [19] and Chen-Lu-Tang [17] established the optimal asymptotic lower bound for stability of the first-order Sobolev inequality and fractional Sobolev inequality of order $s$ for $0&lt;s&lt;1$ respectively. However, it left the problem of the optimal lower bound for stability of high-order Sobolev inequality and high-order fractional Sobolev inequality unsolved. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem.
  The main difficulty lies in establishing the optimal asymptotic behavior for the local stability of the Sobolev inequality for all $0&lt;s&lt;n/2$. The proof of the local stability when $0&lt;s\leq 1$ relies on ``cuttings" at various heights and this helps to split the $L^2$ integral of first order or fractional order derivative of order $0&lt;s&lt;1$. However, this approach does not seem to work for $1&lt;s&lt;n/2$. In order to overcome this difficulty, we directly establish the local stability for the HLS inequality with the optimal asymptotic lower bounds.
  To achieve our goal, we develop a new strategy based on the $H^{-s}-$decomposition instead of $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}-$decomposition to obtain the local stability of the HLS inequality with $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}-$distance. This kind of ``new local stability" also brings more difficulties to using the rearrangement flow to deduce the global stability from local stability because of the non-uniqueness of $\|r\|_{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$ and non-continuity of $\|r\|_{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$ norm for the rearrangement flow. We establish the norm comparison theorem for $\|r\|_{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$ and "new continuity" theorem for the rearrangement flow to overcome this difficulty (see Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.5).</description>

      <title>Non-uniform dependence on initial data for the generalized Camassa-Holm equation in $C^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown in \cite[Adv. Differ. Equ(2017)]{HT} that the Cauchy problem for the generalized Camassa-Holm equation is well-posed in $C^1$ and the data-to-solution map is H\"{o}lder continuous from $C^\alpha$ to $\mathcal{C}([0,T];C^\alpha)$ with $\alpha\in[0,1)$. In this paper, we further show that the data-to-solution map of the generalized Camassa-Holm equation is not uniformly continuous on the initial data in $C^1$. In particular, our result also can be a complement of previous work on the classical Camassa-Holm equation in \cite[Geom. Funct. Anal(2002)]{G02}.</description>

      <title>On basic velocity estimates for the plane steady-state Navier-Stokes system and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider some new estimates for general steady Navier-Stokes solutions in plane domains. According to our main result, if the domain is convex, then the difference between mean values of the velocity over two concentric circles is bounded (up to a constant factor) by the square-root of the Dirichlet integral in the annulus between the circles. The constant factor in this inequality is universal and does not depend on the ratio of the circle radii. Several applications of these formulas are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dissipation and temporal decay in the Euler-Poisson-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global well-posedness and large-time behavior of solutions for a coupled fluid model in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of the isothermal compressible Euler-Poisson system and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled through the drag force. Notably, we exploit the dissipation effects inherent in the Poisson equation to achieve a faster decay of fluid density compared to velocities. This strategic utilization of dissipation, together with the influence of the electric field and the damping structure induced by the drag force, leads to a remarkable decay behavior: the fluid density converges to equilibrium at a rate of $(1+t)^{-11/4}$, significantly faster than the decay rates of velocity differences $(1+t)^{-7/4}$ and velocities themselves $(1+t)^{-3/4}$ in the $L^2$ norm. Furthermore, under the condition of vanishing coupled incompressible flow, we demonstrate an exponential decay to a constant state for the solution of the corresponding system, the damped Euler-Poisson system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly investigate a class of Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck operator with 4 different scalings in nondivergence form. And we assume the coefficients $a^{ij}$ are only measurable in $t$ and satisfy the vanishing mean oscillation in space variables. We establish a global priori estimates of $\nabla_x^u$, $\dy u$ and $\dz u$ in $L^p$ space which extend the work of Dong and Yastrzhembskiy \cite{ref49} where they focus on the 3 different scalings KFP operator. Moreover we establish a kind of Poincare inequality for homogeneous equations.</description>

      <title>Representing the dissipation of infinite-dimensional linear port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that linear and non-linear dissipative port-Hamiltonian systems in finite dimensions admit an energy balance, relating the energy increase in the system with the supplied energy and the dissipated energy. The integrand in the dissipation term is then a function of the state variable. In this note, we answer the question of when this is possible for linear port-Hamiltonian systems in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the cone multiplier satisfies local $L^p$-$L^q$ bounds only in the trivial range $1\leq q\leq 2\leq p\leq\infty$. To do so, we suitably adapt to this setting the proof of Fefferman for the ball multiplier. As a consequence we answer negatively a question by B\'ekoll\'e and Bonami (Colloq. Math. 68, 1995, 81-100), regarding the continuity from $L^p\to L^q$ of the Cauchy-Szeg\"o projections associated with a class of bounded symmetric domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with rank $r\geq2$.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional half-harmonic maps into the circle and their degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a half-harmonic map $u\in \dot H^{\frac{1}{2},2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{S}^1)$ minimizing the fractional Dirichlet energy under Dirichlet boundary conditions in $\mathbb{R}\setminus I$, we show the existence of a second half-harmonic map, minimizing the Dirichlet energy in a different homotopy class. This is a first step towards addressing a problem raised by Brezis and is based on the study of the degree of fractional Sobolev maps and a sharp estimate \`a la Brezis-Coron. We give examples showing that it is in general not possible to minimize in every homotopy class and show a contrast with the 2-dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: We study in this short note a counterpart to the quasilinear generalized parabolic Anderson model (gPAM) on the 2-dimensional torus where the coefficients are nonlocal functionals of the solution. Under a positivity assumption on the diffusion coefficient we give a local in time solution theory within the framework of paracontrolled calculus.</description>

      <title>A Regularization for Time-Fractional Backward Heat Conduction Problem with Inhomogeneous Source Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Nair and Danumjaya (2023) introduced a new regularization method for the homogeneous time-fractional backward heat conduction problem (TFBHCP) in a one-dimensional space variable, for determining the initial value function. In this paper, the authors extend the analysis done in the above referred paper to a more general setting of an inhomogeneous time-fractional heat equation involving the higher dimensional state variables and a general elliptic operator. We carry out the analysis for the newly introduced regularization method for the TFBHCP providing optimal order error estimates under a source condition by choosing the regularization parameter appropriately, and also carry out numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive properties of the quasilinear elliptic equation
  $$-\mathrm{div}\mathcal{A}(x,\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2}u=0\quad (1&lt;p&lt;\infty)\qquad \mbox{ in } \Omega,$$ where the function $\mathcal{A}(x,\xi)$ is induced by a family of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n\geq 2$) parameterized by points in the domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $V$ belongs to a certain local Morrey space. We first establish two-sided estimates for Bregman distances of $|\xi|^{p}_{s,a}$ ($1&lt;s&lt;\infty$), where $a=(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ and $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$ are certain functions with positive local lower and upper bounds in $\Omega$. These estimates lead to a Maz'ya-type characterization for Hardy-weights of the corresponding functionals. Then we prove three types of sufficient conditions for the attainment of the Hardy constant in a certain space $\widetilde{W}^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a locally finite connected graph. We develop the first eigenvalue method on $G$ introduced in 1963 by Kaplan \cite{Kaplan} on Euclidean space, the discrete Phragm\'{e}n-Lindel\"{o}f principle of parabolic equations and upper and lower solutions method on $G$. Using these methods, we establish the estimates and asymptotic behaviour of the life span of solutions to a semilinear heat equation with initial data $\lambda\psi(x)$ for different scales of $\lambda$ on $G$ under some different conditions. Our results are different from the continuous case, which is related to the structure of the graph $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlocal contact problem for two-dimensional linear elliptic equations is stated and investigated. The method of separation of variables is used to find the solution of a stated problem in case of Poisson's equation. Then the more general problem with nonlocal multipoint contact conditions for elliptic equation with variable coefficients is considered and the iterative method to solve the problem numerically is constructed and investigated. The uniqueness and existence of the regular solution is proved. The iterative method allows to reduce the solution of a nonlocal contact problem to the solution of a sequence of classical boundary value problems.</description>

Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness and scattering for the 3D incompressible Euler-Coriolis system with sufficiently small, regular and suitably localized initial data. Equivalently, we obtain the asymptotic stability for "rigid body" rotational solutions to the pure Euler equations. This extends the recent work of Guo, Pausader and Widmayer to the general non-axisymmetric setting.</description>

We apply our estimates to obtain, among other things, a quantitative domination principle, and metric properties of the space of potentials of finite energy.

Abstract: We establish large sets of Anderson localized states for the quasi-periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb Z^d$, thus extending Anderson localization from the linear (cf. Bourgain [GAFA 17(3), 682--706, 2007]) to a nonlinear setting, and the random (cf. Bourgain-Wang [JEMS 10(1), 1--45, 2008]) to a deterministic setting. Among the main ingredients are a new Diophantine estimate of quasi-periodic functions in arbitrarily dimensional phase space, and the application of Bourgain's geometric lemma in [GAFA 17(3), 682--706, 2007].</description>

      <title>Schottky-Invariant $p$-Adic Diffusion Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <title>Full Field Inversion of the Attenuated Wave Equation: Theory and Numerical Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provides data that consist of time-dependent signals governed by the wave equation, which are measured on an observation surface. In contrast, the measured data from the recently invented full-field PAT is the Radon transform of the solution of the wave equation on a spatial domain at a single instant in time. While reconstruction using classical PAT data has been extensively studied, not much is known about the full-field PAT problem. In this paper, we study full-field photoacoustic tomography with spatially variable sound speed and spatially variable damping. In particular, we prove the uniqueness and stability of the associated single-time full-field wave inversion problem and develop algorithms for its numerical inversion using iterative and variational regularization methods. Numerical simulations are presented for both full-angle and limited-angle data cases</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetic Laplacian in a two-dimensional exterior domain with Neumann boundary condition and uniform magnetic field. For the exterior of the disk we establish accurate asymptotics of the low-lying eigenvalues in the weak magnetic field limit. For the exterior of a star-shaped domain, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the lowest eigenvalue in the weak field limit, involving the $4$-moment, and optimal for the case of the disk. Moreover, we prove that, for moderate magnetic fields, the exterior of the disk is a local maximizer for the lowest eigenvalue under a $p$-moment constraint.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain geometric upper bounds for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1^J$ of the Jacobi operator for both closed and compact with boundary hypersurfaces having constant mean curvature (CMC). As an application, we derive new rigidity results for the area of CMC hypersurfaces under suitable conditions on $\lambda_1^J$ and the curvature of the ambient space. We also address the Jacobi-Steklov problem, proving geometric upper bounds for its first eigenvalue $\sigma_1^J$ and deriving rigidity results related to the length of the boundary. Additionally, we present some results in higher dimensions related to the Yamabe invariants.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we remove the small degeneracy assumption in our earlier works [10, 11]. This is achieved by a technical improvement of Corollary 5.1 in [10]. As a consequence, we establish the same geometric estimates for diameter, Green's functions and Sobolev inequalities under an entropy bound for the K\"ahler metrics, without any small degeneracy assumption.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system without angular cutoff and the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system with Coulomb potential near a global Maxwellian $\mu$. We establish the global existence, uniqueness and large time behavior for solutions in a polynomial-weighted Sobolev space $H^2_{x, v}( \langle v \rangle^k)$ for some constant $k &gt;0$. The proof is based on extra dissipation generated from semigroup method and energy estimates on electrostatic field.</description>

      <title>Quadratic estimates for degenerate elliptic systems on manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bounds and boundary value problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted quadratic estimates are proved for certain bisectorial firstorder differential operators with bounded measurable coefficients which are (not necessarily pointwise) accretive, on complete manifolds with positive injectivity radius. As compared to earlier results, Ricci curvature is only assumed to be bounded from below, and the weight is only assumed to be locally in A^2. The Kato square root estimate is proved under this weaker assumption. On compact Lipschitz manifolds we prove solvability estimates for solutions to degenerate elliptic systems with not necessarily self-adjoint coefficients, and with Dirichlet, Neumann and Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: This article establishes local strong well-posedness and global strong well-posedness close to constant equilibria of a model coupling the primitive equations of ocean and atmospheric dynamics with Hibler's viscous-plastic sea ice model. In order to treat the coupling conditions, an approach involving the hydrostatic Dirichlet and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is developed. Mapping properties of the latter operators are investigated for the first time and are of central importance for showing that the operator associated with the linearized coupled system admits a bounded $\mathcal{H}^\infty$-calculus on suitable $\mathrm{L}^q$-spaces. Quasilinear methods allow then to obtain the strong well-posedeness results described above.</description>

Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <title>Energy Distribution for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions on Right Triangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of eigenfunctions on triangles initiated by the first author in \cite{Chr-tri} and \cite{Chr-simp}. The Neumann data of Dirichlet eigenfunctions on triangles enjoys an equidistribution law, being equidistributed on each side. The proof of this result is remarkably simple, using only the radial vector field and a Rellich type integrations by parts. The equidistribution law, including on higher dimensional simplices, agrees with what Quantum Ergodic Restriction would predict. However, distribution of the Neumann data on subsets of a side is not well understood, and elementary methods do not appear to give enough information to draw conclusions.
  In the present note, we first show that an "obvious" conjecture fails even for the simplest right isosceles triangle using only Fourier series. We then use a result of Marklof-Rudnick \cite{Marklof-Rudnick} in which the authors show an interior {\it spatial} equidistribution law for a density-one subsequence of eigenfunctions to give an estimate on energy distribution of eigenfunctions on the interior. Finally we present some numerical computations suggesting the behaviour of eigenfunctions on almost isosceles triangles is quite complicated.</description>

Abstract: Considered herein is a particular nonlinear dispersive stochastic system consisting of Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations. They are coupled by nonlinear terms due to the Yukawa interaction. We consider a case of homogeneous multiplicative noise that seems to be very natural from the perspective of the least action formalism. We are able to show existence and uniqueness of a corresponding Cauchy problem in Bourgain spaces. Moreover, the regarded model implies charge conservation, known for the deterministic analogue of the system, and this is used to prove a global existence result for suitable initial data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that the static solution of the Cauchy problem for a massless real scalar field that is sourced by a point charge in $1+1$ dimensions is asymptotically stable under perturbation by compactly-supported radiation. This behavior is due to the process of back-reaction. Taking the approach of Kiessling, we rigorously derive the expression for the force on the particle from the principle of total energy-momentum conservation. We provide a simple, closed form for the particle's self-action, and show that it is restorative in this model , i.e. proportional to negative velocity, and causes the charge to return to rest after the radiation passes through. We establish these results by studying the joint evolution problem for the particle-scalar field system, and proving its global well-posedness and the claimed asymptotic behavior.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a system of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of mixed elliptic-parabolic type that models the propagation of electric signals and their effect on the deformation of cardiac tissue. The system governs the dynamics of ionic quantities, intra and extra-cellular potentials, and linearized elasticity equations. We introduce a framework called the active strain decomposition, which factors the material gradient of deformation into an active (electrophysiology-dependent) part and an elastic (passive) part, to capture the coupling between muscle contraction, biochemical reactions, and electric activity. Under the assumption of linearized elastic behavior and a truncation of the nonlinear diffusivities, we propose a stochastic electromechanical bidomain model, and establish the existence of weak solutions for this model. To prove existence through the convergence of approximate solutions, we employ a stochastic compactness method in tandem with an auxiliary non-degenerate system and the Faedo--Galerkin method. We utilize a stochastic adaptation of de Rham's theorem to deduce the weak convergence of the pressure approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a model of a thermoelastic string that is initially heated. We classify all the possible asymptotic states when time tends to infinity of such a model. Actually, we show that whatever the initial data is, a heated string must converge to a flat, steady string with uniformly distributed heat. The latter distribution is calculated from the energy conservation. In order to obtain the result, we need to take a few steps. In the first two steps, time-independent bounds from above and from below (by a positive constant) of the temperature are obtained. This is done via the Moser-like iteration. The lower bound is obtained via the Moser iteration on the negative part of the logarithm of temperature. In the third step, we obtain a time-independent higher-order estimate, which yields compactness of a sequence of the values of the solution when time tends to infinity. Here, an estimate involving the Fisher information of temperature, together with a recent functional inequality from \cite{CFHS} and an $L^2(L^2)$ estimate of the gradient of entropy, enable us to arrive at a tricky Gr\"{o}nwall type inequality. Finally, in the last steps, we define the dynamical system on a proper functional phase space and study its $\omega$-limit set. To this end, we use, in particular, the quantitative version of the second principle of thermodynamics. Also, the entropy dissipation term and the bound of the entropy from below are useful when identifying the structure of the $\omega$-limit set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a chemotaxis system that includes two competitive prey and one predator species in a two-dimensional domain, where the movement of prey (resp. predators) is driven by chemicals secreted by predators (resp. prey), called mutually repulsive (resp. mutually attractive) chemotaxis effect. The kinetics for all species are chosen according to the competitive Lotka-Volterra equations for prey and to a Holling type functional response for the predator. Under the biologically relevant scenario that the chemicals diffuse much faster than the individual diffusion of all species and a suitable re-scaling, equations for chemical concentrations are parabolic with slow evolution of coefficient $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$. In the first main result, we show the global existence of a unique classical solution to the system for each $\varepsilon$. Secondly, we study rigorously the so-called fast signal diffusion limit, passing from the system including parabolic equations with the slow evolution to the one with all elliptic equations for chemical concentrations, i.e. the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This explains why elliptic equations can be proposed for chemical concentration instead of parabolic ones with slow evolution. Thirdly, the $L^\infty$-in-time convergence rates for the fast signal diffusion limit are estimated, where the effect of the initial layer is carefully treated. Finally, the differences between the systems with and without the slow evolution, and between the systems with one or two preys are discussed due to numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate one-phase flow in porous medium corresponding to a miscible displacement process in which the viscosity of the injected fluid is smaller than the viscosity in the reservoir fluid, which frequently leads to the formation of a mixing zone characterized by thin fingers. The mixing zone grows in time due to the difference in speed between its leading and trailing edges. The transverse flow equilibrium (TFE) model provides estimates of these speeds. We propose an enhancement for the TFE estimates, and provide its theoretical justification. It is based on the assumption that an intermediate concentration exists near the tip of the finger, which allows to reduce the integration interval in the speed estimate. Numerical simulations were conducted that corroborate the new estimates within the computational fluid dynamics model. The refined estimates offer greater accuracy than those provided by the original TFE model.</description>

Abstract: We develop trace and index formulas for a Dirac-Schr\"odinger operator $D$ on open space of odd dimension $d\geq 3$ with a potential given by a family of self-adjoint unbounded operators acting on a infinite dimensional Hilbert space $H$. The presented results generalize formulas surrounding the Callias index theorem to unbounded operator potentials, for which the operator $D$ is not necessarily Fredholm. We include examples, where the trace formula is used to calculate the Witten index of non-Fredholm massless $(d+1)$-Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators acting in $L^2\left(\mathbb{R}^{d+1},H\right)$.</description>

Abstract: Elliptic reconstruction property, originally introduced by Makridakis and Nochetto for linear parabolic problems, is a well-known tool to derive optimal a posteriori error estimates. No such results are known for nonlinear and nonsmooth problems such as parabolic variational inequalities (VIs). This article establishes the elliptic reconstruction property for parabolic VIs and derives a posteriori error estimates in $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^{2}(\Omega))$. The estimator consists of discrete complementarity terms and standard residual. As an application, the residual-type error estimates are presented.</description>

      <title>New spectral Bishop-Gromov and Bonnet-Myers theorems and applications to isoperimetry</title>

Abstract: We show a sharp and rigid spectral generalization of the classical Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem: if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\geqslant 3$ satisfies \[ \lambda_1\left(-\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta+\mathrm{Ric}\right)\geqslant n-1,\] then $\operatorname{vol}(M)\leqslant \operatorname{vol}(\mathbb S^{n})$, and $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. Moreover, the constant $\frac{n-1}{n-2}$ cannot be improved, and if $\operatorname{vol}(M)=\operatorname{vol}(\mathbb S^n)$ holds, then $M\cong \mathbb S^{n}$. A sharp generalization of the Bonnet-Myers theorem is also shown under the same spectral condition. The proofs involve the use of a new unequally weighted isoperimetric problem, and unequally warped $\mu$-bubbles. As an application, in dimensions $3\leqslant n\leqslant 5$, we infer sharp results on the isoperimetric structure at infinity of complete manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive spectral biRicci curvature.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes that are supported along that interface can be bifurcated from the quadratic degenerate point. The results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experiment realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>
