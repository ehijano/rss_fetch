      <title>{\eta}-ensemble path integral Monte Carlo approach to the free energy of the warm dense electron gas and the uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the recently introduced $\eta$-ensemble approach to compute the free energy directly from \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2407.01044] and apply it to the archetypal uniform electron gas model both in the warm dense matter and strongly coupled regimes. Specifically, we present an in-depth study of the relevant algorithmic details such as the choice of the free weighting parameter and the choice of the optimum number of intermediate $\eta$-steps to connect the real, non-ideal system ($\eta=1$) with the ideal limit ($\eta=0$). Moreover, we explore the inherent decomposition of the full free energy into its ideal bosonic, ideal-to-interacting, and bosonic-to-fermionic contributions for different parameter regimes. Finally, we compare our new free energy data with an existing free energy parametrization [Groth \emph{et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)] obtained via adiabatic connection formula evaluations, and we find very good agreement in its range of applicability, i.e., for density parameters $r_s\leq20$; in addition, we present the first PIMC results for the free energy in the low density regime of $20 &lt; r_s\leq 100$. We expect our results to be of interest both for the study of matter under extreme conditions, as well as to the more general field of PIMC simulations of interacting quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery: A CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons Enhance Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that the conditions for ferromagnetic order in, e.g., magnetite, can be modified by adsorption of chiral molecules. Especially, the coercivity of magnetite was increased by nearly 100 \%, or 20 times the earth magnetic flux density, at room temperature. The coercivity was, moreover, demonstrated to increase linearly with temperature in a finite range around room temperature. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed for providing the necessary enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy. It is shown that nuclear vibrations (phonons) coupled to ferromagnetic spin excitations (magnons) absorb the thermal energy in the system, thereby diverting the excess energy that otherwise would excite magnons in the ferromagnet. This energy diversion, not only restores the ferromagnetic order but also enhances its stability by increasing the anisotropy energy for magnon excitations. The coupling between phonons with magnons is enabled by chirality due to the lack of inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace where we diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers to quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Nanogap-Engineered Core-Shell-Like Nanostructures for Comprehensive SERS Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of fabrication protocols for large-area plasmonic nanostructures with sub-10 nm gaps with a spatially controlled distribution is critical for their real-world applications. In this work, we develop a simple, cleanroom-free protocol for the fabrication of macroscopic-sized plasmonic substrates (&gt;6 cm^2), featuring a tunable multi-resonance optical response and light concentration in sub-10 nm gaps. Critically, these gaps are free to interact with the surrounding medium. This architecture consists of non-periodically distributed dielectric nanospheres coated with a metal multilayer, forming semi-spherical core-shell-like nanostructures (CSLNs) surrounded by a planar film. The sub-10 nm gaps formed between metal caps and the planar film are easily tuned by adjusting fabrication parameters such as multimetal layer thickness, composition, or nanosphere size and density. The excellent structural homogeneity, wide optical tunability, and extreme light confinement in the spatially controlled subwavelength nanogaps make CSLN-based substrates an ideal platform for comprehensive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. This is proven through a combination of numerical modeling and iterative fabrication/characterization, leading to the optimized substrates showing cutting-edge spatial uniformity down to 1.9% determined as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the SERS signal of p-mercaptobenzoic acid for 225 spectra over 3600 {\mu}m^2 area. High sensitivity is evidenced by an enhancement factor of ~10^6. The proposed substrates also meet all other demanding criteria, including sufficient signal temporal stability (RSD &lt;4%), high substrate-to-substrate reproducibility (&lt;15%), and SERS activity towards three various analytes. The unique geometry and wide spectral tunability of the CSLN substrates will also be of great value for other plasmon-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Screening of Local Spin Moments at Metal-Molecule Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.</description>

      <title>Monolayer Capping Provides Close to Optimal Resistance to Laser Dewetting of Au Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.</description>

      <title>Impact of dipole self-energy on cavity-induced nonadiabatic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of matter to the quantized electromagnetic field of a plasmonic or optical cavity can be harnessed to modify and control chemical and physical properties of molecules. In optical cavities, a term known as the dipole self-energy (DSE) appears in the Hamiltonian to assure gauge invariance. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we introduce a method, which has its own merits and complements existing methods, to compute the DSE. Second, we study the impact of the DSE on cavity-induced nonadiabatic dynamics in a realistic system. For that purpose, various matrix elements of the DSE are computed as functions of the nuclear coordinates and the dynamics of the system after laser excitation is investigated. The cavity is known to induce conical intersections between polaritons, which gives rise to substantial nonadiabatic effects. The DSE is shown to slightly affect these light-induced conical intersections and, in particular, break their symmetry.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and unconventional superconductivity in a simple model of metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. This bipartite motif is common in reticular materials. We show that a tight-binding model on this lattice yields partially occupied interference-induced flat bands at half-filling with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range hopping induces curvature in the bands but leaves them flatter and more isolated than those in twisted bilayer graphene. The slave boson theory of the t-J model on this lattice shows highly unconventional superconductivity including an f -wave singlet phase. Thus, framework materials provide an ideal lattice-driven approach to strongly correlated phenomena in flat bands at high electronic densities.</description>

      <title>Signatures of supermassive charged gravitinos in liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work [K.A. Meissner and H. Nicolai, Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 84}, 269 (2024)], two of the present authors have suggested possible experimental ways to search for stable supermassive particles with electric charges of $\cO(1)$ in upcoming underground experiments, in particular the new Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment. In the current paper, we present a detailed analysis of the specific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector and for upcoming liquid argon detectors like DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment). The proposed method of detection relies on the ``glow'' produced by photons during the passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for about a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the track. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of the scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing gravitino are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that, if such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and unmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be seen by the JUNO or DUNE photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very different research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search for a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum chemistry on the other.</description>
