      <title>Structure of center vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $\pm 1$) and doubly charged vortices. Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$ vortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in spacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations of the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in which doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of elementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is described to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Many of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their relative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the differences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching chains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex convergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In addition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are observed to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a constant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary vortices as it propagates. Combined, these findings provide a characterization of the vortices that comprise center vortex structures in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>The Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule, i.e. the lowest odd moment of the parity-violating structure function, $F_3$, of the nucleon from a lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude. Our calculations are performed on $48^3 \times 96$ lattices at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point for two lattice spacings. We extract the moments for several values of the current momenta in the range $0.5 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 10 \; {\rm GeV}^2$, covering both the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes. We compare our moments to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule and discuss the implications for higher-twist effects, a determination of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ from a hadronic quantity complementing the phenomenological and other lattice approaches, and electroweak box contributions crucial for CKM unitarity studies.</description>

      <title>Progress on lattice study of the chimera baryon spectrum in Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigation of composite Higgs
  models (CHMs) is of importance in contemporary particle physics. In this
  article, we present lattice computations of the chimera baryon masses in $Sp(4)$
  gauge theory with two and three Dirac flavours of hyperquarks (beyond the Standard Model fermions coupled to the $Sp(4)$ gauge fields) in the
  fundamental and antisymmetric representations, respectively.
  The chimera baryons are crucial for generating the Standard Model
  fermion masses through the partial compositeness mechanism in this
  gauge theory that can serve as the ultraviolet completion of the CHM with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the coset $SU(4)/Sp(4)$.
  Results shown here are primarily from a completed quenched computation, while
  those from our ongoing work with dynamical
  simulations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD.In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \sim 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A_\mu(s)A_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <title>Landau levels for discrete-time quantum walks in artificial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4337</link>
      <description>arXiv:1412.4337v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of 2D discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) is presented and shown to coincide, in the continuous limit, with the Dirac dynamics of a spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and uniform magnetic field. Landau levels are constructed, not only in the continuous limit, but also for the DTQWs i.e. for finite non-vanishing values of the time- and position-step, by a perturbative approach in the step. Numerical simulations support the above results and suggest that the magnetic interpretation is valid beyond the scope of the continuous limit. The possibility of quantum simulation of condensed-matter systems by DTQWs is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and discrete Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:1508.00038v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particular example is produced to prove that quantum walks can be used to simulate full-fledged discrete gauge theories. A new family of $2D$ walks is introduced and its continuous limit is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and possess a discrete gauge-invariant conserved current. A discrete gauge-invariant electromagnetic field is also constructed and that field is coupled to the conserved current by a discrete generalization of Maxwell equations. The dynamics of the DTQWs under crossed electric and magnetic fields is finally explored outside the continuous limit by numerical simulations. Bloch oscillations and the so-called ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift are recovered in the weak-field limit. Localization is observed for some values of the gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks and non-Abelian discrete gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.01605v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on the line with an exact discrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance is introduced. It is shown that the continuous limit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete generalization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate interpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields and $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their continuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical (i.e. non-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this article constitute a first step towards quantum simulations of generic Yang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time quantum walks as fermions of lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.08303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that discrete-time quantum walks can be used to digitize, i.e., to time discretize fermionic models of continuous-time lattice gauge theory. The resulting discrete-time dynamics is thus not only manifestly unitary, but also ultralocal, i.e. the particle's speed is upper bounded, as in standard relativistic quantum field theories. The lattice chiral symmetry of staggered fermions, which corresponds to a translational invariance, is lost after the requirement of ultralocality of the evolution; this fact is an instance of Meyer's 1996 no-go lemma stating that no non-trivial one-dimensional scalar quantum cellular automaton can be translationally invariant [1]. All results are presented in a single-particle framework and for a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.04488v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is one of the more important concepts in physics. We discuss this concept in connection with the unitary evolution of discrete-time quantum walks in one and two spatial dimensions, when they include the interaction with synthetic, external electromagnetic fields. One introduces this interaction as additional phases that play the role of gauge fields. Here, we present a way to incorporate those phases, which differs from previous works. Our proposal allows the discrete derivatives, that appear under a gauge transformation, to treat time and space on the same footing, in a way which is similar to standard lattice gauge theories. By considering two steps of the evolution, we define a density current which is gauge invariant and conserved. In the continuum limit, the dynamics of the particle, under a suitable choice of the parameters, becomes the Dirac equation, and the conserved current satisfies the corresponding conservation equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of quantum relativistic diffusion via quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.09791v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two models are first presented, of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) with temporal noise on the internal degree of freedom (i.e., the coin): (i) a model with both a coin-flip and a phase-flip channel, and (ii) a model with random coin unitaries. It is then shown that both these models admit a common limit in the spacetime continuum, namely, a Lindblad equation with Dirac-fermion Hamiltonian part and, as Lindblad jumps, a chirality flip and a chirality-dependent phase flip, which are two of the three standard error channels for a two-level quantum system. This, as one may call it, Dirac Lindblad equation, provides a model of quantum relativistic spatial diffusion, which is evidenced both analytically and numerically. This model of spatial diffusion has the intriguing specificity of making sense only with original unitary models which are relativistic in the sense that they have chirality, on which the noise is introduced: The diffusion arises via the by-construction (quantum) coupling of chirality to the position. For a particle with vanishing mass, the model of quantum relativistic diffusion introduced in the present work, reduces to the well-known telegraph equation, which yields propagation at short times, diffusion at long times, and exhibits no quantumness. Finally, the results are extended to temporal noises which depend smoothly on position.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks in weak electric fields and Bloch oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.05346v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations appear when an electric field is superimposed on a quantum particle that evolves on a lattice with a tight-binding Hamiltonian (TBH), i.e., evolves via what we will call an electric TBH; this phenomenon will be referred to as TBH Bloch oscillations. A similar phenomenon is known to show up in so-called electric discrete-time quantum walks (DQWs); this phenomenon will be referred to as DQW Bloch oscillations. This similarity is particularly salient when the electric field of the DQW is weak. For a wide, i.e., spatially extended initial condition, one numerically observes semi-classical oscillations, i.e., oscillations of a localized particle, both for the electric TBH and the electric DQW. More precisely: The numerical simulations strongly suggest that the semi-classical DQW Bloch oscillations correspond to two counter-propagating semi-classical TBH Bloch oscillations. In this work it is shown that, under certain assumptions, the solution of the electric DQW for a weak electric field and a wide initial condition is well approximated by the superposition of two continuous-time expressions, which are counter-propagating solutions of an electric TBH whose hopping amplitude is the cosine of the arbitrary coin-operator mixing angle. In contrast, if one wishes the continuous-time approximation to hold for spatially localized initial conditions, one needs at least the DQW to be lazy, as suggested by numerical simulations and by the fact that this has been proven in the case of a vanishing electric field.</description>

      <title>Excluding Stable Quark Matter: Insights from the QCD Vacuum Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark matter (or quark nuggets), composed of quarks in the QCD deconfined and chiral-symmetry restored phase, has been conjectured to exist in nature for over half a century. With zero external pressure, it is stabilized by the balance between the quark Fermi pressure and the QCD vacuum pressure. Whether quark matter is more stable than ordinary nuclei has been a long-standing question, which requires understanding of the QCD vacuum energy. In this work, we employ both theoretical and data-driven methods to derive the QCD vacuum energy, utilizing the GMOR relation, the low-energy theorem, the equation of state from Lattice QCD, and the instanton gas/liquid model. The QCD vacuum energy is determined to be between $(163\,\mbox{MeV})^4$ and $(190\,\mbox{MeV})^4$. Alongside the quark matter pressure calculated from perturbative QCD calculations, both the 2-flavor (via Bodmer) and 2+1-flavor (via Witten) quark matter are found to be more than 100 MeV per baryon heavier than the nucleons. Therefore, we exclude the possibility of quark matter being a more stable state than ordinary nuclei.</description>

      <title>Long-range interactions in double heavy tetraquarks $\bar Q \bar Q qq$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the large distances compared to the chiral symmetry breaking scale, a four-quark system $\bar Q \bar Q qq$ (with $Q$ as heavy and $q$ as light quarks) can be treated as two asymptotic mesons interacting via strong residual forces. The static heavy quark assumption enables using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where one can compute the potential between two heavy antiquarks in the presence of two light quarks of finite mass -- a prescription utilized in several lattice QCD studies. To analyse the long-range strong force in a $\bar Q \bar Q qq$ system, we study the interaction between two bottom mesons in the heavy quark limit using chiral effective field theory and dispersion theory with unphysical pion mass. We present methods to obtain two-pion-exchange potential between two static heavy mesons at non-physical pion mass and compare our preliminary results with the corresponding lattice QCD potentials.</description>

      <title>Computing real-time quantum path integrals on Sewed, almost-Lefschetz thimbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to compute real-time path integrals numerically, by Monte-Carlo sampling on near-Lefschetz thimbles. We present a collection of tools based on the Lefschetz thimble methods, which together provide an alternative to existing methods such as the Generalised thimble. These involve a convenient coordinate parameterization of the thimble, direct numerical integration along a radial coordinate into an effective path integral weight and locally deforming the Lefschetz thimble using its Gaussian (non-interacting theory) counterpart in a region about the critical point. We apply this to quantum mechanics, identify possible pitfalls and benefits, and benchmark its efficiency.</description>

      <title>The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$ at long distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our lattice QCD result for the long-distance part of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution, $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD}$, to the muon $g-2$ in the time-momentum representation. This is the numerically dominant, and at the same time the most challenging part regarding statistical precision. Our calculation is based on ensembles with dynamical up, down and strange quarks, employing the O($a$)-improved Wilson fermion action with lattice spacings ranging from $0.035-0.099$ fm. In order to reduce statistical noise in the long-distance part of the correlator to the per-mille level, we apply low-mode averaging and combine it with an explicit spectral reconstruction. Our result is $(a_\mu^{\rm hvp})^{\rm LD} = 423.2(4.2)_{\rm stat}(3.4)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$ in isospin-symmetric QCD, where the pion decay constant is used to set the energy scale. When combined with our previous results for the short- and intermediate-distance window observables and after including all sub-dominant contributions as well as isospin-breaking corrections, we obtain the total leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution as $a_\mu^{\rm hvp} = 724.5(4.9)_{\rm stat}(5.2)_{\rm syst}\times 10^{-10}$. Our result displays a tension of 3.9 standard deviations with the data-driven estimate published in the 2020 White Paper, but leads to a SM prediction for the total muon anomalous magnetic moment that agrees with the current experimental average.</description>

      <title>QCD predictions for physical multimeson scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light-flavor diquarks in the inverse matrix method of QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reexamines the spectroscopic parameters of light-flavor diquarks within the framework of quantum chromodynamics sum rules (QCDSR) using the inverse matrix method. Conventional QCDSR analyses are based on assumptions such as quark-hadron duality and continuum models, which introduce a degree of systematic uncertainty. The inverse matrix method circumvents these assumptions by reformulating the problem as an inverse integral equation and expanding the unknown spectral density using orthogonal Laguerre polynomials. This method allows for a direct determination of spectral densities, thereby enhancing the precision of predictions regarding resonance masses and decay constants. By employing this methodology with regard to light-flavor diquarks ($sq$ and $ud$), it is possible to extract the associated masses and decay constants. The results indicate that the masses of diquarks with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 0^-$ are nearly degenerate. We compare our results regarding masses and decay constants with those of other theoretical predictions, which could prove a useful complementary tool in interpretation. Our results are consistent with those in the literature and can be shown as evidence for the consistency of the method. The results achieved in this study highlight the potential of the inverse matrix method as a robust tool for exploring nonperturbative QCD phenomena and elucidating the internal structure of exotic hadronic systems.</description>
