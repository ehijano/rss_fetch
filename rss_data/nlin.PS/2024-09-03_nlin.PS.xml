      <title>Synchronized Memory-Dependent Intracellular Oscillations for a Cell-Bulk ODE-PDE Model in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a cell-bulk ODE-PDE model in $\mathbb{R}^2$, a hybrid asymptotic-numerical theory is developed to provide a new theoretical and computationally efficient approach for studying how oscillatory dynamics associated with spatially segregated dynamically active ``units" or ``cells" are regulated by a PDE bulk diffusion field that is both produced and absorbed by the entire cell population. The study of oscillator synchronization in a PDE diffusion field was one of the initial aims of Yoshiki Kuramoto's foundational work. For this cell-bulk model, strong localized perturbation theory, as extended to a time-dependent setting, is used to derive a new integro-differential ODE system that characterizes intracellular dynamics in a memory-dependent bulk-diffusion field. For this nonlocal reduced system, a novel fast time-marching scheme, relying in part on the \emph{sum-of-exponentials method} to numerically treat convolution integrals, is developed to rapidly and accurately compute numerical solutions to the integro-differential system over long time intervals. For the special case of Sel'kov reaction kinetics, a wide variety of large-scale oscillatory dynamical behavior including phase synchronization, mixed-mode oscillations, and quorum-sensing are illustrated for various ranges of the influx and efflux permeability parameters, the bulk degradation rate and bulk diffusivity, and the specific spatial configuration of cells. Results from our fast algorithm, obtained in under one minute of CPU time on a laptop, are benchmarked against PDE simulations of the cell-bulk model, which are performed with a commercial PDE solver, that have run-times that are orders of magnitude larger.</description>

      <title>Suppression of soliton collapses, modulational instability, and rogue-wave excitation in two-L\'evy-index fractional Kerr media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: s in laser systems with two fractional-dispersion/diffraction terms, quantified by their L\'{e}vy indices, $\alpha_{1}\, \alpha_{2}\in (1, 2]$, and self-focusing or defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. Some fundamental solitons are obtained by means of the variational approximation, which are verified by comparison with numerical results. We find that the soliton collapse, exhibited by the one-dimensional cubic fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with only one L\'{e}vy index $\alpha =1$, can be suppressed in the two-L\'{e}vy-index fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system. Stability of the solitons is also explored against collisions with Gaussian pulses and adiabatic variation of the system parameters. Modulation instability of continuous waves is investigated in the two-L\'{e}vy-index system too. In particular, the modulation instability may occur in the case of the defocusing nonlinearity when two diffraction coefficients have opposite signs. Using results for the modulation instability, we produce first- and second-order rogue waves on top of continuous waves, for both signs of the Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear two-dimensional water waves with arbitrary vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional water-wave problem with a general non-zero vorticity field in a fluid volume with a flat bed and a free surface. The nonlinear equations of motion for the chosen surface and volume variables are expressed with the aid of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator and the Green function of the Laplace operator in the fluid domain. Moreover, we provide new explicit expressions for both objects.
  The field of a point vortex and its interaction with the free surface is studied as an example. In the small-amplitude long-wave Boussinesq and KdV regimes, we obtain appropriate systems of coupled equations for the dynamics of the point vortex and the time evolution of the free surface variables.</description>

      <title>Two-stage initial-value iterative physics-informed neural networks for simulating solitary waves of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new two-stage initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for solitary wave computations of nonlinear wave equations based on traditional numerical iterative methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically, the IINN framework consists of two subnetworks, one of which is used to fit a given initial value, and the other incorporates physical information and continues training on the basis of the first subnetwork. Importantly, the IINN method does not require any additional data information including boundary conditions, apart from the given initial value. Corresponding theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our IINN method. The proposed IINN method is efficiently applied to learn some types of solutions in different nonlinear wave equations, including the one-dimensional (1D) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) equation (with and without potentials), the 1D saturable NLS equation with PT -symmetric optical lattices, the 1D focusing-defocusing coupled NLS equations, the KdV equation, the two-dimensional (2D) NLS equation with potentials, the 2D amended GP equation with a potential, the (2+1)-dimensional KP equation, and the 3D NLS equation with a potential. These applications serve as evidence for the efficacy of our method. Finally, by comparing with the traditional methods, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IINN method.</description>

      <title>Swarm Systems as a Platform for Open-Ended Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial swarm systems have been extensively studied and used in computer science, robotics, engineering and other technological fields, primarily as a platform for implementing robust distributed systems to achieve pre-defined objectives. However, such swarm systems, especially heterogeneous ones, can also be utilized as an ideal platform for creating *open-ended evolutionary dynamics* that do not converge toward pre-defined goals but keep exploring diverse possibilities and generating novel outputs indefinitely. In this article, we review Swarm Chemistry and its variants as concrete sample cases to illustrate beneficial characteristics of heterogeneous swarm systems, including the cardinality leap of design spaces, multiscale structures/behaviors and their diversity, and robust self-organization, self-repair and ecological interactions of emergent patterns, all of which serve as the driving forces for open-ended evolutionary processes. Applications to science, engineering, and art/entertainment as well as the directions of further research are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Causality-guided adaptive sampling method for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to purely data-driven methods, a key feature of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) - a proven powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) - is the embedding of PDE constraints into the loss function. The selection and distribution of collocation points for evaluating PDE residuals are critical to the performance of PINNs. Furthermore, the causal training is currently a popular training mode. In this work, we propose the causality-guided adaptive sampling (Causal AS) method for PINNs. Given the characteristics of causal training, we use the weighted PDE residuals as the indicator for the selection of collocation points to focus on areas with larger PDE residuals within the regions being trained. For the hyper-parameter $p$ involved, we develop the temporal alignment driven update (TADU) scheme for its dynamic update beyond simply fixing it as a constant. The collocation points selected at each time will be released before the next adaptive sampling step to avoid the cumulative effects caused by previously chosen collocation points and reduce computational costs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the Causal AS method, we apply it to solve time-dependent equations, including the Allen-Cahn equation, the NLS equation, the KdV equation and the mKdV equation. During the training process, we employe a time-marching technique and strictly impose the periodic boundary conditions by embedding the input coordinates into Fourier expansion to mitigate optimization challenges. Numerical results indicate that the predicted solution achieves an excellent agreement with the ground truth. Compared to a similar work, the causal extension of R3 sampling (Causal R3), our proposed Causal AS method demonstrates a significant advantage in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Vector rogue waves in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study three-component rogue waves (RWs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Using the multiscale perturbative method, we obtain approximate analytical solutions for RWs with positive and negative effective masses, determined by the effective dispersion of the system. The solutions include RWs with smooth and striped shapes, as well as higher-order RWs. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the RWs in the three components of the system exhibit different velocities and their maximum peaks appear at the same spatiotemporal position, which is caused by SOC and interactions. The accuracy of the approximate analytical solutions is corroborated by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the underlying system. Additionally, we systematically explore existence domains for the RWs determined by the baseband modulational instability (BMI). Numerical simulations corroborate that, under the action of BMI, plane waves with random initial perturbations excite RWs, as predicted by the approximate analytical solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FPUT paradox is the phenomenon whereby a one-dimensional chain of oscillators with nonlinear couplings shows non-ergodic behavior. The trajectory of the system in phase space, with a long wavelength initial condition, closely follows that of the Toda model over short times, as both systems seem to relax quickly to a non-thermal, metastable state. Over longer times, resonances in the FPUT spectrum drive the system towards equilibrium, away from the Toda trajectory. Similar resonances are observed in $q$-breather spectra, suggesting that $q$-breathers are involved in the route towards thermalization. In this article we investigate such resonances and show that they occur due to exact overlaps of $q$-breather frequencies of the type $m\Omega_1 = \Omega_k$. The resonances appear as peaks in the energy spectrum. Further, they give rise to new composite periodic orbits, which exist simultaneously with the original $q$-breathers. We find that such resonances are absent in integrable systems, as a consequence of the (infinite number of) conservation laws associated with integrability.</description>

      <title>Stationary and moving bright solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling in a Zeeman field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the discovery of various matter wave solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), exploring their properties has become increasingly significant. We mainly study stationary and moving bright solitons in spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 BECs with or without a Zeeman field. The bright solitons correspond to the plane wave (PW) and standing wave (SW) phases. With the assistance of single-particle energy spectrum, we obtain the existence domains of PW and SW solitons by analytical and numerical methods. The results indicate that the interaction between atoms is also a key factor determining the existence of solitons. In addition, we systematically discuss the stability domains of PW and SW solitons, and investigate the impact of different parameters on the stability domains. We find that PW solitons are unstable when the linear Zeeman effect reaches a certain threshold, and the threshold is determined by other parameters. The linear Zeeman effect also leads to the alternating distribution of stable and unstable areas of SW solitons, and makes SW solitons stably exist in the area with stronger ferromagnetism. Finally, we analyze the collision dynamics of different types of stable solitons.</description>

      <title>The non-reciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems with non-reciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform non-reciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the criticality of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a non-reciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its critical behavior by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spins types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where non-reciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.</description>

Abstract: From cytoskeletal networks to tissues, many biological systems behave as active materials. Their composition and stress-generation is affected by chemical reaction networks. In such systems, the coupling between mechanics and chemistry enables self-organization, for example, into waves. Recently, contractile mechanochemical systems were shown to be able to spontaneously develop localized spatial patterns. Here, we show that these localized patterns can present intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics, including oscillations and chaotic dynamics. We discuss their physical origin and bifurcation structure.</description>

      <title>The energy-frequency diagram of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two different methods are used to study the existence and stability of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon. The variational technique approximates it by a periodic function with a set of adiabatically changing parameters. An alternative approach treats oscillons as standing waves in a finite-size box; these are sought as solutions of a boundary-value problem on a two-dimensional domain. The numerical analysis reveals that the standing wave's energy-frequency diagram is fragmented into disjoint segments with $\omega_{n+1} &lt; \omega &lt; \omega_{n}$, where $\omega_n= \omega_0/ (n+1)$, $n=0,1,2, ...$, and $\omega_0$ is the endpoint of the continuous spectrum (mass threshold of the model). The variational approximation involving the first, zeroth and second harmonic components provides an accurate description of the oscillon with the frequency in $(\omega_1, \omega_0)$, but breaks down as $\omega$ falls out of that interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>
