      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <title>Current Algebra and Generalised Cartan Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article shows that the approach to generalised curvature and torsion pioneered by Polacek and Siegel [1] is a generalisation of Cartan Geometry -- rendering latter natural from the point of view of O(d,d)-generalised geometry. We present this approach in the generalised metric formalism and show that almost all parts of the additional higher generalised tensors appearing in this approach correspond to covariant derivatives of the generalised Riemann tensor. As an application, we use this framework to phrase sigma model dynamics in an explicitly covariant way -- both under generalised diffeomorphisms and local gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Generalised symmetries in linear gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearised gravity has a global symmetry under which the graviton is shifted by a symmetric tensor satisfying a certain flatness condition. There is also a dual symmetry that can be associated with a global shift symmetry of the dual graviton theory. The corresponding conserved charges are shown to satisfy a centrally-extended algebra. We discuss the gauging of these global symmetries, finding an obstruction to the simultaneous gauging of both symmetries which we interpret as a mixed 't Hooft anomaly for the ungauged theory. We discuss the implications of this, analogous to those resulting from a similar structure in Maxwell theory, and interpret the graviton and dual graviton as Nambu-Goldstone modes for these shift symmetries.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the $SO(9) \rightarrow SO(3) \times SO(6)$ Symmetry Breaking in the IKKT Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a dynamical mechanism which explains why in the supersymmetric IKKT matrix model the $SO(9)$ symmetry of the Lagrangian is spontaneously broken to $SO(3) \times SO(6)$, allowing only three large classical spatial dimensions to emerge. The argument relies on the identification of D1-strings as stable excitations of the matrices about the cosmological background, and the absence of forces between parallel D1-string excitations. A spatial dimension can only become large if the D1-strings winding that direction can annihilate. In the absence of forces, this requires the string world sheets to intersect, a process which is highly suppressed if more than three dimensions of space are large. Implications for a recently proposed matrix cosmology scenario are discussed.</description>

      <title>Accurate Critical Exponents from the Optimal Truncation of the epsilon- Expansion within the O(N)-symmetric Field Theory for large N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbation series for the renormalization group functions of the $O(N)-$symmetric $\phi^4$ field theory are divergent but asymptotic. They are usually followed by Resummation calculations to extract reliable results. Although the same features exist for QED series, their partial sums can return accurate results because the perturbation parameter is small. In this work, however, we show that, for $N\ge4$, the partial sum ( according to optimal truncation) of the series for the exponents $\nu$ and $\eta$ gives results that are very competitive to the recent Monte Carlo and Conformal field calculations. The series can be written in terms of the perturbation parameter $\alpha=\sigma\varepsilon=\frac{3}{N+8}\varepsilon$ which is smaller for larger $N$ and thus as $N$ increases one expects accurate perturbative results like the QED case. Such optimal truncation, however, doesn't work for the series of the critical exponent $\omega$ ( for intermediate values of $N$) as the truncated series includes only the first order. Nevertheless, for $N\ge4$, the large-order parameter $\sigma=\frac{3}{N+8}$ is getting smaller which rationalizes for the use of the Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation. For that aim, we first obtain the seven-loop $\varepsilon$-series from the recent available corresponding $g$-expansion. The seven-loop Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation gives accurate results for the three exponents. Besides, for all the seven orders in the series, the large-$N$ limit leads to the exact result predicted by the non-perturbative $1/N$-Expansion.</description>

      <title>Graviton Number Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total number of gravitons emitted during nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes or other effectively point masses is calculated approximately and found to be remarkably close to (well within 1% of, perhaps within about 0.2% of) the initial orbital angular momentum divided by the spin angular momentum of each graviton ($2\hbar$), although at unit initial eccentricity, $2\hbar$ times the initial graviton number emission per angular momentum emission is $248/(45\sqrt{3}\pi) \approx 1.012\,811\,600\,479$, almost 1.3% greater than unity.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo with Neural Network Quantum States for Yang-Mills Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the variational Monte Carlo method based on neural network quantum states, using a neural autoregressive flow architecture as our ansatz, to determine the ground state wave function of the bosonic SU($N$) Yang-Mills-type two-matrix model at strong coupling. Previous literature hinted at the inaccuracy of such an approach at strong coupling. In this work, the accuracy of the results is tested using lattice Monte Carlo simulations: we benchmark the expectation value of the energy of the ground state for system sizes $N$ that are beyond brute-force exact diagonalization methods. We observe that the variational method with neural network states reproduces the right ground state energy when the width of the network employed in this work is sufficiently large. We confirm that the correct result is obtained for $N=2$ and $3$, while obtaining a precise value for $N=4$ requires more resources than the amount available for this work.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Structure of ADHM Sigma Models and $AdS_3$ Superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the supersymmetry structure of ADHM instanton linear sigma models, $N=4$ superconformal algebras and superconformal field theories dual to superstrings moving in $AdS_3$ backgrounds in view of some of our recent findings in various investigations. First of all we collect information about the (0, 4) supersymmetries of Witten's original, Ali-Ilahi's complementary and Ali-Salih's complete ADHM instanton linear sigma models. Then we collect information about large, small and middle $N=4$ superconformal algebras and summarize their interrelations with the ADHM instanton linear sigma models. We then argue that the former, that is the supersymmetry of the ADHM instanton linear sigma models, flows to latter, that is the small, middle and large $N=4$ superconformal symmetries, in the infrared limit. Finally we summarize the mapping of these $N=4$ superconformal symmetries onto the superconformal symmetries dual to superstrings moving on $AdS_3\times S^3\times {\mathcal M}^4$ backgrounds with ${\mathcal M}^=K3, T^4$ and $S^3\times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Kasner eons in Lovelock black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vicinity of space-like singularities, general relativity predicts that the metric behaves, at each point, as a Kasner space which undergoes a series of "Kasner epochs" and "eras" characterized by certain transition rules. The period during which this process takes place defines a "Kasner eon", which comes to an end when higher-curvature or quantum effects become relevant. When higher-curvature densities are included in the action, spacetime can undergo transitions into additional Kasner eons. During each eon, the metric behaves locally as a Kasner solution to the higher-curvature density controlling the dynamics. In this paper we identify the presence of Kasner eons in the interior of static and spherically symmetric Lovelock gravity black holes. We determine the conditions under which eons occur and study the Kasner metrics which characterize them, as well as the transitions between them. We show that the null energy condition implies a monotonicity property for the effective Kasner exponent at the end of the Einsteinian eon. We also characterize the Kasner solutions of more general higher-curvature theories of gravity. In particular, we observe that the Einstein gravity condition that the sum of the Kasner exponents adds up to one, $\sum_{i=1}^{D-1}p_i=1$, admits a universal generalization in the form of a family of Kasner metrics satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^{D-1}p_i=2n -1$ which exists for any order-$n$ higher-curvature density and in general dimensions.</description>

      <title>Higher loop corrections to the current of created pairs in the lengthy electric pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger's current appearing due to the breakdown of the vacuum in the strong constant electric pulse background is well known and calculated in many places. It appears due to the amplification of the zero-point fluctuations. However, we find that in higher loop corrections there are hidden redistributions of the level populations of charged particles and photons. These redistributions lead to the corrections to the current, which become large for the lengthy enough pulse and change the Schwinger's expression for the current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the E-model formulation of the non-deformed Cherednik model as well as of its Poisson-Lie and Poisson-Lie-WZ deformed version. In all three cases we solve the sufficient condition of integrability by using the E-model formalism. We thus recover in an alternative way the known results for the non-deformed and the Poisson-Lie deformed models, while for the Poisson-Lie-WZ deformed one our results are new.</description>

      <title>All vertices for unconstrained symmetric gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the generating system that describes interacting symmetric higher-spin gauge fields at the level of equations of motion was proposed. The interaction vertices it offers are 'off the mass shell' unless constrained by the prescribed factorization condition that properly removes traceful components. In this paper we detail the structure of the unconstrained, i.e., traceful vertices. We derive their manifest form to all orders along with a net of the associated dualities, thus providing the complete higher-spin vertex analysis at the unconstrained level for the bosonic theory in any dimension. These vertices are shown to be the minimal space-time local and have a form of the peculiar integrals over a space of closed polygons, which we scrutinize in the paper. The obtained results directly apply to the holomorphic sector of the four-dimensional theory, where the interaction is on-shell, producing the all-order chiral higher-spin vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Carrollian conformal field theories in two dimensions and construct the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), opening up innumerable possibilities for further studies, given the growing relevance of Carrollian symmetries. We prove that the BCCA emerges by contracting a single copy of the Virasoro algebra. As an application, we construct, for the first time, open null strings and show that, for Dirichlet boundary conditions, we recover the BCCA as the algebra of constraints. We finally reconstruct our string results by taking the null limit of tensile open strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holomorphic modular bootstrap is an approach to classifying rational conformal field theories making use of the modular differential equations. In this paper we explore its flavored refinement. For a class of chiral algebras, we propose constraints on a special null state, which determine the structure of the algebra, and through flavored modular differential equations and quasi-modularity, completely fix the spectra in both the untwisted and twisted sector. Using the differential equations, we reveal hidden structures among null states of the chiral algebras under the modular group action and translation related to spectral flow.</description>

      <title>Confining quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely believed, and axiomatically postulated in mathematical quantum field theory, that the vacuum is a unique vector state (up to a phase factor). The recent solution of the quantum Yang-Mills theory of the strong interaction revealed the presence of two vacua and a mixed quantum state. The second, confining vacuum, is an eigenstate of an auxiliary field, with a non-zero eigenvalue, as opposed to the zero eigenstate of the perturbative vacuum.
  Here, I show that this non-trivial vacuum structure is characteristic of confining quantum field theories, and implies confinement, in the sense that vacuum expectation values between states separated at large, space-like distances, tend to zero, whereas in ordinary quantum theories with a unique vacuum, they are known to satisfy the cluster decomposition principle, and at large separations tend to free, asymptotic states.
  I conclude with a discussion and some tentative comments regarding the general status, problems, and interpretation of quantum field theory for the four known interactions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional non-relativistic Hietarinta supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the non-relativistic regime of the Hietarinta gravity theory and its extension to supergravity. At the bosonic level, we derive the non-relativistic version of the Hietarinta model by employing a contraction process and addressing the non-degeneracy of the invariant metric. To incorporate supersymmetry, we apply the Lie algebra expansion method to obtain the non-relativistic formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ Hietarinta supergravity. Our results reveal that the non-relativistic Hietarinta theory encompasses the extended Bargmann (super)gravity as a special case, yet it differs significantly from other existing non-relativistic (super)gravity models. Furthermore, we generalize our analysis to include a cosmological constant term in the non-relativistic Hietarinta (super)gravity action and examine its effects on the torsion structure.</description>

      <title>Localization of the 5D supergravity action and Euclidean saddles for the black hole index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate equivariant localization of the gravitational on-shell action in odd dimensions, focusing on five-dimensional ungauged supergravity. We analyze the conditions for cancellation of boundary terms, so that the full action integral is given in terms of the odd-dimensional analog of the nuts and bolts of Gibbons-Hawking. We specialize to supersymmetric configurations with an additional ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry preserving the supercharge and provide a formula for the localized on-shell action. We construct asymptotically flat Euclidean supersymmetric non-extremal solutions with two independent rotations and an arbitrary number of electric charges, providing black hole saddles of the gravitational path integral that computes a supersymmetric index, and evaluate their action equivariantly. We find that these Euclidean saddles smoothly interpolate between the supersymmetric extremal black holes and two-center horizonless microstate geometries. The interpolating parameter is the formal temperature, which does not appear in the action; hence the two limiting solutions give the same contribution to the index.</description>

      <title>The Dark Dimension and the Grand Unification of Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, predicting one extra mesoscopic dimension in the micron range, has emerged by applying various Swampland principles to the dark energy. In this note we find that realizing the grand unification of gauge forces is highly constraining in this context. Without actually constructing any GUT models, we argue that the mere assumption of grand unification of forces in this scenario, together with the experimental bounds on massive replicas of the Standard Model gauge bosons, predicts an upper bound for the GUT scale, $M_{GUT}\lesssim 10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. Combined with the experimental bound on the proton lifetime, this predicts that the $X$ gauge boson mediating proton decay is a 5d solitonic string of Planckian tension stretched across a length scale $L\sim ({\rm 1-10\ TeV})^{-1}$ ending on gauge branes of the same diameter $\sim L$. This leads to a mass of $M_X\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. In particular assuming grand unification in the dark dimension scenario results in a tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations of Standard Model gauge bosons on the gauge branes in the 1-10 TeV range. This suggests that the diameter/separation $L$ of the gauge branes correlates with both the weak scale $\sim 1/L$ near a TeV {\it and} the GUT scale $\sim M_5^2 L$ at $10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Mutual information from modular flow in CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators in the replica trick framework enables a long-distance expansion of the mutual information (MI) in conformal field theories (CFTs). In this expansion, the terms are labeled by primary operators, as contributions from descendant operators can be resummed into conformal blocks. However, for the MI, the expansion involves primaries from the multi-replica theory, which includes far more operators than those in the original theory. In this work, we develop a method to resum this series, yielding an expansion in terms of the primaries of the original theory, specifically restricted to the two-copy sector. This is achieved by expressing the twist operators in a non-local manner across different replicas and using a modular flow representation to obtain the n -&gt; 1 limit of the R\'enyi index. We explicitly compute the resulting "enhanced conformal blocks", which, surprisingly, provide excellent approximations to the MI of generalized free fields across the full range of cross ratios. Remarkably, this approximation appears to be exact in the limit of large spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Finite entangling regions and information paradox in charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the dynamics of fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, collected in finite entangling regions, is affected by the value of its electric charge. We show that the entropy saturates at lower values with increasing charge, and in the near-extremal case the time to reach a constant value significantly increases. We also demonstrate that, starting with some sufficiently large sizes of finite regions, it is always possible to choose such a charge value that there is no information paradox formulated for finite entangling regions. For the sake of completeness, we explore how entanglement islands influence the described picture. We find that at small values of the electric charge, there is a discontinuity in the entropy due to the disappearance of the island, and with increasing charge the island ceases to ever dominate throughout entire evolution.</description>

      <title>Critical magnetic field in the strong regime for 3+1 holographic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we explore different aspects of a $3+1$ strongly coupled superconductor in the presence of an intense magnetic field. In order to study this interesting and highly complicated system, we make use of the holographic correspondence. We construct a gravitational solution incorporating a fully backreacted Maxwell field while treating a charged scalar field as a perturbation propagating on this background. Our work focuses on the implications of intense magnetic fields on superconductivity in the strongly coupled regime, offering insights into the modifications that such a field induces on key aspects of the superconducting phase. Through rigorous numerical analysis of the holographic model, we uncover intriguing effects arising from the interplay between the magnetic field and the superconducting condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that integrating out M2 states on Calabi-Yau manifolds captures non-perturbative topological string physics in the free energy. In this note, we show that the resulting expression manifests a certain duality symmetry: the free energy at strong string coupling is equal to the Calabi-Yau period at weak string coupling. The duality yields the appropriate prescription for completing the integrating out in the ultraviolet.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. Arguments for their existence are reviewed along with their essential properties. We propose a complex analytic manifold $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a pseudo moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit computations at $g=1$ including the analysis of transformations under the modular group support this proposal, and show that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space. For $g \geq 2$, whether $\mathcal{P}_g$ contains redundancy at each value of the complex structure moduli remains open.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Scale and Conformal Invariance in Heterotic $\sigma$-Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that all perturbative scale invariant heterotic sigma models with a compact target space $M^D$ are conformally invariant. The proof, presented in detail for up to and including two loops, utilises a geometric analogue of the $c$-theorem based on a generalisation of the Perelman's results on geometric flows. Then, we present examples of scale invariant heterotic sigma models with target spaces that exhibit special geometry, which is characterised by the holonomy of the connection with torsion a 3-form, and explore the additional conditions that are necessary for such sigma models to be conformally invariant. For this, we find that the geometry of the target spaces is further restricted to be either conformally balanced or the a priori holonomy of the connection with torsion reduces. We identify the pattern of holonomy reduction in the cases that the holonomy is $SU(n)$ $(D=2n)$, $Sp(k)$ $D=4k)$, $G_2$ $(D=7)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ $(D=8)$. We also investigate the properties of these geometries and present some examples.</description>

      <title>Analytical short- and long-range kink-like structures in scalar field models with polynomial interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field models which engender kink-like solutions in the presence of polynomial potentials that allows for modifications of the tails of the localized configurations. We introduce a parameter in the potential that controls the classical mass associated to its minima. By using the first-order framework developed by Bogomol'nyi, we obtain analytical solutions that become more and more interactive as we increase such parameter. By investigating the limit in which the parameter tends to infinite, the kink solution gets power law tails, and we show that this feature is related to the behavior of the classical mass, which vanishes in the aforementioned limit. We also investigate the stability against small fluctuations, with the results unveiling that, depending on the values of the parameter, the stability potential may support several bound states and also, it may attain a volcano-like profile.</description>

      <title>Spectral Representation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions are significantly more complex than their flat-space analogues, such as tree-level scattering amplitudes. While these amplitudes have simple analytic structure and clear factorisation properties, cosmological correlators often feature branch cuts and lack neat expressions. In this paper, we develop off-shell perturbative methods to study and compute cosmological correlators. We show that such approach not only makes the origin of the correlator singularity structure and factorisation manifest, but also renders practical analytical computations more tractable. Using a spectral representation of massive cosmological propagators that encodes particle production through a suitable $i\epsilon$ prescription, we remove the need to ever perform nested time integrals as they only appear in a factorised form. This approach explicitly shows that complex correlators are constructed by gluing lower-point off-shell correlators, while performing the spectral integral sets the exchanged particles on shell. Notably, in the complex mass plane instead of energy, computing spectral integrals amounts to collecting towers of poles as the simple building blocks are meromorphic functions. We demonstrate this by deriving a new, simple, and partially resummed representation for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars mediated by tree-level massive scalar exchange in de Sitter. Additionally, we establish cosmological largest-time equations that relate different channels on in-in branches via analytic continuation, analogous to crossing symmetry in flat space. These universal relations provide simple consistency checks and suggest that dispersive methods hold promise for developing cosmological recursion relations, further connecting techniques from modern scattering amplitudes to cosmology.</description>

      <title>Chaotic measures as an alternative to spectral measures for analysing turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09885v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence has associated chaotic features. In the past couple of decades there has been growing interest in the study of these features as an alternative means of understanding turbulent systems. Our own input to this effort has been in contributing to the initial studies of chaos in Eulerian flow using direct numerical simulation (DNS). In this review we discuss the progress achieved in the turbulence community in understanding chaotic measures including our own work. A central relation between turbulence and chaos is one by Ruelle that connects the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the Reynolds number. The first DNS studies, ours amongst them, in obtaining this relation has shown the viability of chaotic simulation studies of Eulerian flow. Such chaotic measures and associated simulation methodology provides an alternative means to probe turbulent flow. Building on this, we have analyzed the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) and studied its fluctuations, and found that chaotic measures could be quantified accurately even at small simulation box sizes where for comparative sizes spectral measures would be inconclusive. We further highlight applications of chaotic measures in analyzing phase transition behavior in turbulent flow and two dimensional thin layer turbulent systems. This work has shown chaotic measures are an excellent tool that can be used alongside spectral measures in studying turbulent flow.</description>

Abstract: We have derived the Wigner equations at global equilibrium with constant vorticity but space-time dependent electromagnetic fields up to second order in semiclassical expansion. We obtain the new second-order contributions to the charge currents and energy-momentum tensor from the varying electromagnetic fields. We also compute the new corrections to the spin polarization pesudo-vector from both contant and varying electromagnetic fields. We also find that the space-time dependent electromagnetic field provides a tighter constraint on the solutions of Wigner functions in global equilibrium compared with constant electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a semi-analytical model that describes the convective core mass evolution of massive stars experiencing mass loss during the main-sequence stage. We first conduct a suite of 1D stellar evolution calculations to build insight into how convective core masses behave under idealized mass loss. Based on these simulations, we find several universal relations between global properties of the star that hold regardless of the mass loss history. By combining these relations, we construct a semi-analytic framework that can predict the convective core mass evolution for arbitrary mass loss histories and hence the helium core mass at the end of the main sequence. Our formulae improve upon existing methods for predicting the core mass in rapid population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>Wormhole formations in the galactic halos supported by dark matter models and global monopole charge within $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the possibility of traversable wormholes in the galactic region supported by dark matter (DM) models and global monopole charge in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. To understand the features of the wormholes, we comprehensively studied wormhole solutions with various redshift functions under different $f(Q)$ models. We obtained wormhole shape functions for Pseudo Isothermal (PI) and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profiles under linear $f(Q)$ gravity. In contrast, we employed an embedding class I approach for the non-linear $f(Q)$ models to investigate wormholes. We noticed that our obtained shape functions satisfy the flare-out conditions under an asymptotic background for each DM profile. Moreover, we checked the energy conditions at the wormhole throat with a radius $r_0$ and noticed the influences of the global monopole's parameter $\eta$ in the violation of energy conditions, especially null energy conditions. Further, for the non-linear case, we observed that wormhole solutions could not exist for $f(Q)=Q+mQ^n$, $f(Q)=Q+\frac{\beta}{Q}$, and $f(Q)=\alpha_1+\beta_1 \log(Q)$ under embedding class I approach. Finally, we study the amount of exotic matter via the volume integral quantifier technique for the linear $f(Q)$ model, and we confirm that a small amount of exotic matter is required to sustain the traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Look beyond additivity and extensivity of entropy for black hole and cosmological horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the plethora of nonextensive and/or nonadditive entropies which go beyond the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation. After defining the basic notions of additivity, extensivity, and composability we discuss the properties of these entropies and their mutual relations, if they exist. The results are presented in two informative tables supposedly of strong interest to gravity and cosmology community in the context of explored vastly recent days the horizon entropies for black hole and cosmological models. This is since gravitational systems admit long-range interactions which usually lead to a break of the standard additivity rule for thermodynamical systems composed of subsystems in Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics. The features of additivity, extensivity, and the composability are listed systematically. Some brief discussion on the validity of the notion of equilibrium temperature for nonextensive systems is also presented.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and the analytical continuation of non-self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We briefly review the analytical continuation method for determining quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the associated frequencies in open systems. We explore two exactly solvable cases based on the P\"oschl-Teller potential to show that the analytical continuation method cannot determine the full set of QNMs and frequencies of a given problem starting from the associated bound state problem in Quantum Mechanics. The root of the problem is that many QNMs are the analytically continued counterparts of solutions that do not belong to the domain where the associated Schr\"odinger operator is self-adjoint, challenging the application of the method for determining full sets of QNMs. We illustrate these problems through the physically relevant case of BTZ black holes, where the natural domain of the problem is the negative real line.</description>

      <title>Analytic results in aligned axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original model of axion natural inflation produces a tensor-to-scalar ratio above the experimental limit. Aligned axion inflation admits inflationary trajectories that originate near a saddle point of the two-field potential, and terminate due to the instability of the orthogonal direction. The phenomenology of these solutions is within the current constraints, and a range of parameters will be probed by the next stage CMB experiments. We provide the analytic solution for these trajectories and very compact analytic expressions for the associated phenomenology. For parameters leading to the observed value for the scalar spectral tilt the extension of the inflationary trajectory is sub-Planckian. However, one eigenvalue of the axion kinetic matrix (in the basis that diagonalizes the potential) is trans-Planckian. Finally, we discuss the post-inflationary evolution after the instability. In some cases, the fields reach a second inflationary valley, connected to a minimum. Multiple stages of inflation might be a more general occurrence in multiple-field inflationary models with trajectories starting next to critical points.</description>

      <title>QCD Perturbation Theory: It's not what you were taught</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities in QCD do not depend upon $\alpha_s(Q)$. There is no way to measure $\alpha_s(Q)$ experimentally. If those statements sound shocking, please read on. They are actually well-known facts, though ones that are constantly being ignored in the QCD literature. Renormalized perturbation theory is not an ordinary power-series expansion; its renormalization-scheme ambiguity is not merely a minor nuisance. Rather, it is a structure in which invariance under redefinitions of the coupling is a fundamental symmetry -- a symmetry that, like any other, deserves respect. I speak bluntly because without a change in mindset perturbative QCD can never become a proper, scientific enterprise.</description>

      <title>Probing Anomalous Higgs Boson Couplings at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, our main focus is on the $HHH$ and $VVHH$ couplings which are loosely bound. The $HHH$ coupling will determine the shape the Higgs potential and $VVHH$ couplings will tell us how the gauge bosons are coupled to the Higgs fields. We consider a few processes of Higgs boson production and decay to study these couplings. We calculate one-loop QCD and electroweak correction for these processes. In this thesis, we discuss spinor helicity formalism, which has been used in computing Feynman amplitudes for QCD and electroweak correction to these processes. We discuss one-loop Feynman integrals and one-loop electroweak renormalization and Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction scheme in this thesis. We compute all possible self-energy contributions at one-loop for electroweak renormalization. In this thesis, in the first work, we consider the process $b\bar{b}\rightarrow W^+W^-H$. Due to the non-negligible coupling of the Higgs boson with the bottom quarks, there is a dependence on the $WWHH$ coupling in this process. We find that the corrections to the final state with the longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons are large. In the second work, we study one-loop electroweak correction to $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu_e}\nu_\mu\bar{\nu_\mu}$. We discuss $\gamma^5$-anomaly, complex mass scheme and input parameter schemes which are relevant for one-loop electroweak correction. The corrections depend on the $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. We investigate this dependence in $\kappa$-framework. In the third work, we study one-loop electroweak correction to the $H\rightarrow e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process. The corrections depend on $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. We observe the same behavior in the relative change of the decay width for this process as the process $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu_e}\nu_\mu\bar{\nu_\mu}$ when we vary $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons impinging on strong electromagnetic fields can change both momentum and helicity state, due to quantum vacuum polarisation. We investigate these effects in the collision of photons with impulsive PP-waves, which describe e.g. the fields of ultra-boosted charge distributions. We connect our results to vacuum birefringence and quantum reflection in both QED and SUSY QED. We also compare with helicity flip in plane wave backgrounds, exploring how and when known tree-level relations, relating amplitudes in PP-waves and in plane waves, extend to one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative quasinormal modes of Schwarzchild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r - \varphi$ and $r - t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Investigating early and late-time epochs in $ f(Q) $ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the following work, a new hybrid model of the form $ f(Q)=Q(1+a)+b\frac{Q_0^2}{Q} $ has been proposed and confronted using both early as well as late-time constraints. We first use conditions from the era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in order to constrain the models which are further used to study the evolution of the Universe through the deceleration parameter. This methodology is employed for the hybrid model as well as a simple model of the form $ \alpha_1 Q+\alpha_2 Q_0 $ which is found to reduce to $\Lambda$CDM. The error bar plot for the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets which includes the comparison with $\Lambda$CDM, has been studied for the constrained hybrid model. Additionally, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling of the model against three datasets -- CC, Pantheon+SH0ES, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to find the best-fit ranges of the free parameters. It is found that the constraint range of the model parameter ($a$) from the BBN study has a region of overlap with the ranges obtained from the MCMC analysis. Finally, we perform a statistical comparison between our model and the $\Lambda$CDM model using AIC and BIC method.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Constraining anisotropic diffusion between Geminga and Earth with the cosmic-ray electron and positron spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gamma-ray halo surrounding Geminga suggests a notable reduction in cosmic-ray diffusion. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is the projection effect of slow diffusion perpendicular to the average magnetic field (represented by the diffusion coefficient $D_\perp$) within an anisotropic diffusion framework. In this context, the diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean field ($D_\parallel$) may remain substantial, allowing electrons and positrons ($e^\pm$) generated by Geminga to effectively propagate towards Earth along magnetic field lines, potentially leading to an observable $e^\pm$ flux. This study initially establishes the fundamental parameters of the anisotropic model based on the morphology and spectral observations of the Geminga halo, and subsequently forecasts the $e^\pm$ flux generated by Geminga at Earth's location. Our findings indicate that the $e^-+e^+$ spectrum obtained by DAMPE can provide critical constraints on the anisotropic diffusion model: to ensure that the projected spectrum does not surpass the observational data, the Alfv\'en Mach number of the turbulent magnetic field ($M_A$) should not fall below 0.75, corresponding to $D_\parallel/D_\perp\lesssim3$ given $D_\perp=D_\parallel M_A^4$. This suggests that a substantial reduction in $D_\parallel$ relative to the Galactic average may still be necessary. Additionally, our analysis reveals that within the anisotropic diffusion framework, Geminga could generate a distinct peak around 1 TeV in the $e^-+e^+$ spectrum, potentially accounting for the anomalous 1.4 TeV excess tentatively detected by DAMPE.</description>

Abstract: We study supertranslations at spatial and future timelike infinity in the first-order formalism. We relax the Ashtekar-Engle-Sloan boundary conditions to allow supertranslations at the spatial infinity and obtain the precise form of the tetrads and Lorentz connections. Employing the covariant phase space technique we obtain the Hamiltonian charges for the supertranslations at both timelike and spatial infinities. The charges obtained are shown to match the expressions reported adopting the metric-based approach.</description>

      <title>Merging cosmologically coupled black holes: stochastic gravitational wave background and implications for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. We examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by merging supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, the enhancement factor can exceed an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from binary BH mergers, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrinophilic mediators at FASER$\nu$, FLArE and FASER$\nu$2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High energy collider neutrinos have been observed for the first time by the FASER$\nu$ experiment. The detected spectrum of collider neutrinos scattering off nucleons can be used to probe neutrinophilic mediators with GeV-scale masses. We find that constraints on the pseudoscalar (axial vector) neutrinophilic mediator are close to the scalar (vector) case since they have similar cross section in the neutrino massless limit. We perform an analysis on the measured muon spectra at FASER$\nu$, and find that the bounds on the vector mediator from the current FASER$\nu$ data are comparable to the existing bounds at $m_{Z^\prime}\approx 0.2$ GeV. We also study the sensitivities to a neutrinophilic mediator at future Forward Physics Facilities including FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 by using both the missing transverse momentum and the charge identification information. We find that FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 can impose stronger bounds on both the scalar and vector neutrinophilic mediators than the existing bounds. The constraints on the scalar mediator can reach 0.08 (0.1) for $m_\phi\lesssim1$ GeV with (without) muon charge identification at FASER$\nu$2.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 27$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting scalar dark matter around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can provide crucial insights about the environments in which black holes live. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations to study the behaviour of self-interacting scalar (wave-like) dark matter clouds accreting onto isolated and binary black holes. We find that repulsive self-interactions smoothen the ``spike'' of an isolated black hole and saturate the density. Attractive self-interactions enhance the growth and result in more cuspy profiles, but can become unstable and undergo explosions akin to the superradiant bosenova that reduce the local cloud density. We quantify the impact of self-interactions on an equal-mass black hole merger by computing the dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal for a range of couplings. We find that repulsive self-interactions saturate the density of the cloud, thereby reducing the dephasing. For attractive self-interactions, the dephasing may be larger, but if these interactions dominate prior to the merger, the dark matter can undergo bosenova during the inspiral phase, disrupting the cloud and subsequently reducing the dephasing.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duality in various dimensions is understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. We rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic ``modulating'' translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hyper-invariant tensor network designed to faithfully simulate the AdS/CFT correspondence, akin to the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). The proposed construction integrates bulk indices within the network architecture to uphold the key features of the HaPPY code, including complementary recovery. This hyper-invariant framework accurately reproduces the boundary conformal field theory's (CFT) two- and three-point correlation functions, while considering the image of any bulk operator. Furthermore, we provide an explicit methodology for calculating the correlation functions in an efficient manner. Our findings highlight the physical aspects of the relation between bulk and boundary within the tensor network models, contributing to the understanding and simulation of holographic principles in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation with four SU(2) doublet fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single exactly massless staggered fermion in the fundamental representation of an $SU(2)$ gauge group. We utilize an nHYP-smeared fermion action supplemented with additional heavy Pauli-Villars fields which serve to decrease lattice artifacts. The phase diagram exhibits a clear two-phase structure with a conformal phase at weak coupling and a novel new phase, the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase, appearing at strong coupling. The SMG phase is confining with all states gapped and chiral symmetry unbroken. Our finite size scaling analysis provides strong evidence that the phase transition between these two phases is continuous, which would allow for the existence of a continuum SMG phase. Furthermore, the RG flows are consistent with a $\beta$-function that vanishes quadratically at the new fixed point suggesting that the $N_f=4$ flavor SU(2) gauge theory lies at the opening of the conformal window.</description>

Abstract: There are two sets of orbits of the Virasoro group which admit a K\"ahler structure. We consider the construction of coherent states for the orbit $\widehat{{\rm diff}\,S^1}$/$SL(2, {\mathbb R})$ which furnishes unitary representations of the group. The procedure is analogous to geometric quantization using a holomorphic polarization. We also give an explicit formula for the K\"ahler potential for this orbit and comment on normalization of the coherent states. We further explore some of the properties of these states, including the definition of symbols corresponding to operators and their star products. Some comments which touch upon the possibility of applying this to gravity in (2+1) dimensions are also given.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Time from Unitary Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of unitary equivalence $\hat{H}\sim\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mod}}\hat{U}$ between the modular Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mod}}$ and the subsystem Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the context of realizing the emergence of time through a unitary operator $\hat{U}$. This concept suggests a duality between the modular flow and time evolution. Additionally, requiring unitary equivalence implies a connection between the "Modular Chaos Bound" and the "Chaos Bound". Furthermore, we demonstrate this duality using quantum chaos diagnostic quantities in the thermofield double state of a fermionic system. Quantum chaos diagnostic quantities are mathematical measures that characterize chaotic behavior in quantum systems. By examining these quantities in the thermofield double state, we illustrate the duality between them and the modular Hamiltonian. We show a specific duality between correlators, the spectral form factor, and the Loschmidt echo with the modular Hamiltonian. The spectral form factor is a quantity that provides information about the energy spectrum of a quantum system, while the Loschmidt echo characterizes the sensitivity of a system's modular time evolution to perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that a different entanglement spectrum does not impose the same constraint on the subsystem Hamiltonian. The entanglement spectrum is related to entanglement entropy and provides information about the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix associated with a subsystem. We discuss complex concepts related to the interplay between quantum chaos, time emergence, and the relationship between modular and subsystem Hamiltonians. These ideas are part of ongoing research in quantum information theory and related fields.</description>

      <title>Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms and the generalized geometrical trinity of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) as described in terms of curvature by the Einstein-Hilbert action is dynamically equivalent to theories of gravity formulated in terms of spacetime torsion or non-metricity. This forms what is called the geometrical trinity of gravity. The theories corresponding to this trinity are, apart from GR, the teleparallel (TEGR) and symmetric teleparallel (STEGR) equivalent theories of general relativity, respectively, and their actions are equivalent to GR up to boundary terms $B$. We investigate how the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term of GR changes under the transition to TEGR and STEGR within the framework of metric-affine gravity. We show that $B$ is the difference between the GHY term of GR and that of metric-affine gravity. Moreover, we show that the GHY term for both TEGR and STEGR must vanish for consistency of the variational problem. Furthermore, our approach allows to extend the equivalence between GR, TEGR and STEGR beyond the Einstein-Hilbert action to any action built out of the curvature two-form, thus establishing the generalized geometrical trinity of gravity. We argue that these results will be particularly useful in view of studying gauge/gravity duality for theories with torsion and non-metricity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the properties of quarter-BPS local operators in four dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the formalism of holomorphic twists. We study loop corrections both to the space of local operators and to algebraic operations which endow the twisted theory with an infinite symmetry algebra. We classify all single-trace quarter-BPS operators in the planar approximation for $SU(N)$ gauge theory and propose a holographic dual description for the twisted theory. We classify perturbative quarter-BPS operators in $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories with sufficiently small quantum numbers and discuss possible non-perturbative corrections to the answer. We set up analogous calculations for some theories with matter.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial Area Operators Require Non-local Magic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that no stabilizer codes over any local dimension can support a non-trivial area operator for any bipartition of the physical degrees of freedom even if certain code subalgebras contain non-trivial centers. This conclusion also extends to more general quantum codes whose logical operators satisfy certain factorization properties, including any complementary code that encodes qubits and supports transversal logical gates that form a nice unitary basis. These results support the observation that some desirable conditions for fault tolerance are in tension with emergent gravity and suggest that non-local "magic" would play an important role in reproducing features of gravitational back-reaction and the quantum extremal surface formula. We comment on conditions needed to circumvent the no-go result and examine some simple instances of non-stabilizer codes that do have non-trivial area operators.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant, Dark Matter and the ElectroWeak Scale meet in the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Swampland program, which looks for low energy theories consistent with quantum gravity, has led to the introduction of a dark dimension stemming from the cosmological constant. We show that the same argument leads to the emergence of the electroweak scale, once the dark dimension is realised in a warped background. A second warped extra dimension at the TeV scale is, therefore, postulated, where the long-standing problem of the hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck scales can be addressed. Furthermore, standard model contributions to the cosmological constant are tamed, together with the gravitational ones. In the emergent holistic picture of gravity and gauge interactions, both Planck and the electroweak scales are emergent from a theory with two fundamental scales: $10^{-2}$ eV and $10^{10}$ GeV, which are of geometric origin and, following the Distance Conjecture, natural. Hence, a bridge is established between the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We study the relation between the quantum integrable systems derived from the dimer graphs and five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^4$. We construct integrable systems based on new dimer graphs obtained from modification of hexagon dimer diagram. We study the gauge theories in correspondence to the newly proposed integrable systems. By examining three types of defects -- a line defect, a canonical co-dimensional two defect and a monodromy defect -- in five-dimensional gauge theory with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and $\Omega_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}$-background. We identify, in the $\varepsilon_2 \to 0$ limit, the canonical co-dimensional two defect satisfying the Baxter T-Q equation of the generalized $A$-type dimer integrable system, and the monodromy defect as its common eigenstate of the commuting Hamiltonians, with the eigenvalues being the expectation value of the BPS Wilson loop in the anti-symmetric representation of the bulk gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ABJM theory, enriched RG flows between circular 1/6 BPS bosonic and 1/2 BPS fermionic Wilson loops have been introduced in arXiv:2211.16501. These flows are triggered by deformations corresponding to parametric 1/6 BPS fermionic loops. In this paper we revisit the study of these operators, but instead of circular contours we consider an interpolating cusped line and a latitude and study their RG flow in perturbation theory. This allows for the definition of a Bremsstrahlung function away from fixed points. We generalize to this case the known cusp/latitude correspondence that relates the Bremsstrahlung function to a latitude Wilson loop. We find that away from the conformal fixed points the ordinary identity is broken by the conformal anomaly in a controlled way. From a defect perspective, the breaking of the correspondence can be traced back to the appearance of an anomalous dimension for fermionic operators localized on the defect. As a by-product, we provide a brand new result for the two-loop cusp anomalous dimension of the 1/6 BPS fermionic and the 1/6 BPS bosonic Wilson lines.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We construct Type IIB string theory setups which, via double holography, realize two gravitational systems in separate AdS spaces which interact with each other and with a non-gravitational bath. We employ top-down string theory solutions with concrete field theory duals in the form of 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM BCFTs and a first-principles notion of double holography. The setups are used to realize pairs of `near' and `far' black holes from the perspective of the bath, which exchange Hawking radiation with each other and radiate into the bath. We identify three phases for the entropy in the bath characterized as no island, partial island and full island, and discuss the entropy curves. The setups differ from the black hole binaries observed in gravitational wave experiments but may capture certain aspects.</description>

We study this problem starting with the simplest cases and we show how it can be solved for scalars parametrizing Riemannian symmetric sigma-models as in maximal and half-maximal supergravities. Then, we use this result to write democratic pseudoactions for theories in which the scalars are non-minimally coupled to (p+1)-form potentials in any dimension. These results include a proposal of democratic pseudoaction for the generic bosonic sector of 4-dimensional maximal and half-maximal ungauged supergravities. Furthermore, we propose a democratic pseudoaction for the bosonic sector of N=2B,d=10 supergravity (the effective action of the type IIB superstring theory) containing two 0-, two 2-, one 4-, two 6- and three 8-forms which is manifestly invariant under global SL(2,R) transformations.</description>

Abstract: If the metric is chosen to depend exponentially on the conformal factor, and if one works in a gauge where the conformal factor has the wrong sign propagator, perturbative quantum gravity corrections can be partially resummed into a series of terms each of which is ultraviolet finite. These new terms however are not perturbative in some small parameter, and are not individually BRST invariant, or background diffeomorphism invariant. With appropriate parametrisation, the finiteness property holds true also for a full phenomenologically relevant theory of quantum gravity coupled to (beyond the standard model) matter fields, provided massive tadpole corrections are set to zero by a trivial renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic condensate and energy-momentum tensor in cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we analyze the expectation value of the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor associated with a massive charged fermionic quantum field with a nonzero chemical potential propagating in a magnetic-flux-carrying cosmic string in thermal equilibrium at finite temperature $T$. The expectation values of the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor are expressed as the sum of vacuum expectation values and the finite temperature contributions coming from the particles and antiparticles excitation. The thermal expectations values of the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor are even periodic functions of the magnetic flux with period being the quantum flux, and also even functions of the chemical potential. Because the analyses of vacuum expectation of the fermionic condensate and energy-momentum tensor have been developed in literature, here we are mainly interested in the investigation of the thermal corrections. In this way we explicitly study how these observable behaves in the limits of low and high temperatures, and also for points near the string. Besides the analytical discussions, we included some graphs that exhibit the behavior of these observable for different values of the physical parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Cosmological Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description in the Luttinger-Ward functional approach, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extra dimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections in a self-consistent manner when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extra dimension, we observe that a partial class of the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. In this study, we apply this theoretical framework into an Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients $RG-flow$ along the extra dimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the generic solution of the Newman-Penrose equations in the Newman-Unti gauge with vanishing curvature tensor. The obtained solutions are the vacua of the gravitational theory which are connected to the derivations in metric formalism from exponentiating the infinitesimal BMS generators in the BMS gauge in \cite{Compere:2016jwb,Compere:2016hzt} by a radial transformation. The coordinate transformations in the Newman-Unti gauge connecting each vacuum are also obtained. We confirm that the supertranslation charge of the gravitational vacua with respect to global considerations vanishes exactly not only in the Einstein theory but also when including the Holst, Pontryagin, and Gauss-Bonnet terms which verifies that the gravitational vacua are not affected by those trivial or boundary terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $U(1)$ gauge theory on $M^4\times T^4$ with background magnetic fluxes. We show that a theory including arbitrary fluxes can always be studied in a theory involving only diagonal fluxes by appropriate coordinate transformations. It is found that the number of independent magnetic fluxes is equal to the rank of the classical value of the field strength matrix, ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. The number of massless zero modes induced from extra components of higher-dimensional gauge field (Wilson-line scalar field), is also determined by ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. We explicitly confirm that the quantum corrections due to the matter fermion to the squared mass of Wilson-line scalar field cancel out at one-loop level. For this purpose, we derive the fermion mass spectrum on $M^4\times T^4$ with arbitrary fluxes. By taking the flux diagonal basis, creation and annihilation operators for Kaluza-Klein quantum numbers are defined appropriately. Our results are easily generalized to the case of $M^4\times T^{2n}~(n\geq3)$.</description>

      <title>The energy-frequency diagram of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two different methods are used to study the existence and stability of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon. The variational technique approximates it by a periodic function with a set of adiabatically changing parameters. An alternative approach treats oscillons as standing waves in a finite-size box; these are sought as solutions of a boundary-value problem on a two-dimensional domain. The numerical analysis reveals that the standing wave's energy-frequency diagram is fragmented into disjoint segments with $\omega_{n+1} &lt; \omega &lt; \omega_{n}$, where $\omega_n= \omega_0/ (n+1)$, $n=0,1,2, ...$, and $\omega_0$ is the endpoint of the continuous spectrum (mass threshold of the model). The variational approximation involving the first, zeroth and second harmonic components provides an accurate description of the oscillon with the frequency in $(\omega_1, \omega_0)$, but breaks down as $\omega$ falls out of that interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <title>Learning S-Matrix Phases with Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to study the relation between the modulus and phase of amplitudes in $2\to 2$ elastic scattering at fixed energies. Unlike previous approaches, we do not employ the integral relation imposed by unitarity, but instead train FNOs to discover it from many samples of amplitudes with finite partial wave expansions. When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus. Our application of FNOs is unconventional: it involves a simultaneous regression-classification task and emphasizes the role of statistics in ensembles of NOs. We comment on the merits and limitations of the approach and its potential as a new methodology in Theoretical Physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the causal structure of the bulk AdS spacetime is tied to entanglement in the dual CFT. This relationship is captured by the connected wedge theorem, which states that a bulk scattering process implies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ entanglement between associated boundary subregions. In this paper, we study the connected wedge theorem in two asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes: the conical defect and BTZ black hole geometries. In these settings, we find that bulk scattering processes require not just large entanglement, but also additional restrictions related to candidate RT surfaces which are non-minimal. We argue these extra relationships imply a certain CFT entanglement structure involving internal degrees of freedom. Because bulk scattering relies on sub-AdS scale physics, this supports the idea that sub-AdS scale locality emerges from internal degrees of freedom. While the new restriction that we identify on non-minimal surfaces is stronger than the initial statement of the connected wedge theorem, we find that it is necessary but still not sufficient to imply bulk scattering in mixed states.</description>

Abstract: We consider a scalar quantum field theory with global $O(N)^3$ symmetry in four Euclidean dimensions and solve it numerically in closed form in the large-N limit. For imaginary tetrahedral coupling the theory is asymptotically free, with stable and real quantum effective action. We demonstrate the dynamical build-up of a strong interaction as the correlation length increases in a regime where the coupling renormalization flow remains well defined in the infrared. This is in contrast to perturbative results of asymptotically free theories, which predict that the coupling becomes ill-defined in the infrared, like in quantum chromodynamics. These properties make the model an important laboratory for the study of strong-coupling phenomena in quantum field theory from first principles.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Perturbation of Hairy Black Holes in EsGB theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate scalar field perturbations of the hairy black holes involved with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global U(1) symmetry in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory for asymptotically flat spacetimes. We consider the mechanism that black holes without hairs become unstable at the critical point of the coupling constant and undergo a phase transition to hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This transition occurs near the black hole horizon due to the diminishing influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term at infinity. To examine such process, we introduce a scalar field perturbation on the newly formed background spacetime. We solve the linearized perturbation equation using Green's function method. We begin by solving the Green's function, incorporating the branch cut contribution. This allows us to analytically investigate the late-time behavior of the perturbation at both spatial and null infinity. We found that the late-time behavior only differs from the Schwarzschild black hole by a mass term. We then proceed to calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) numerically, which arise from the presence of poles in the Green's function. Our primary interest lies in utilizing QNMs to investigate the stability of the black hole solutions both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases. Consistent with the prior study, our analysis shows that hairy black holes in the symmetric phase become unstable when the quadratic coupling constant exceeds a critical value for a fixed value of the quartic coupling constant. In contrast, hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase are always stable at the critical value. These numerical results provide strong evidence for a dynamical process that unstable black holes without hairs transition into stable hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase through the spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a proof of 5D $A_n$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$, where the gauge theory side is one dimension higher than the original 4D case, and corresponds to the q-deformation of the 2D conformal field theory side. We define a q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg integral, which generalizes the $A_n$ Selberg integral and the q-deformed $A_1$ Selberg integral in the literature. A q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg average formula with $n+1$ Schur polynomials is proposed and proved to complete the proof.</description>

Abstract: We use the loop-by-loop Baikov representation to investigate the geometries in Feynman integrals contributing to the classical dynamics of a black-hole two-body system in the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity. These geometries determine the spaces of functions to which the corresponding Feynman diagrams evaluate. As a proof of principle, we provide a full classification of the geometries appearing up to three loops, i.e. fourth post-Minkowskian order, for all diagrams relevant to the conservative as well as the dissipative dynamics, finding full agreement with the literature. Moreover, we show that the non-planar top topology at four loops, which is the most complicated sector with respect to integration-by-parts identities, has an algebraic leading singularity and thus can only depend on non-trivial geometries through its subsectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that thermal effective field theory controls the long-distance expansion of the partition function of a $d$-dimensional QFT, with an insertion of any finite-order spatial isometry. Consequently, the thermal partition function on a sphere displays a fractal-like structure as a function of angular twist, reminiscent of the behavior of a modular form near the real line. As an example application, we find that for CFTs, the effective free energy of even-spin minus odd-spin operators at high temperature is smaller than the usual free energy by a factor of $1/2^d$. Near certain rational angles, the partition function receives subleading contributions from "Kaluza-Klein vortex defects" in the thermal EFT, which we classify. We illustrate our results with examples in free and holographic theories, and also discuss nonperturbative corrections from worldline instantons.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

Abstract: We construct dimer graphs for type D relativistic Toda models by introducing impurities to the $Y^{2N,0}$ square dimer graphs. By properly placing the impurities and change of canonical variables assigned to the 1-loops on the dimer graph, we introduce the "folding" of the graphs and get the type D relativistic Toda lattice Hamiltonian and monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>A Supersymmetric Extension of $w_{1+\infty}$ Algebra in the Celestial Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric topological $W_{\infty} $ algebra by using the $\lambda $ deformed bosons $(\beta,\gamma)$ and fermions $(b,c)$ ghost system. By considering the real bosons and the real fermions at $\lambda=0$ (or $\lambda=\frac{1}{2}$), the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{\frac{\infty}{2}}$ algebra is obtained. At $\lambda=\frac{1}{4}$, other ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra is determined. We also obtain the extension of Lie superalgebra $PSU(2,2|{\cal N}=4)$ appearing in the worldsheet theory by using the symplectic bosons and the fermions. We identify the soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitino, the photon (the gluon), the photino (the gluino) or the scalars, equivalent to ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}[\lambda]$ algebra, in two dimensions with the ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity theory in four dimensions discovered by Freedman, van Nieuwenhuizen and Ferrara in 1976 and its matter coupled theories, via celestial holography.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the AdS/CFT correspondence framework, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>Holographic Lifshitz flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Without Lorentz symmetry, generic fixed points of the renormalization group (RG) are labelled by their dynamical (or `Lifshitz') exponent $z$. Hence, a rich variety of possible RG flows arises. The first example is already given by the standard non-relativistic limit, which can be viewed as the flow from a $z=1$ UV fixed point to a $z=2$ IR fixed point. In strongly coupled theories, there are good arguments suggesting that Lorentz invariance can emerge dynamically in the IR from a Lorentz violating UV. In this work, we perform a generic study of fixed points and the possible RG flows among them in a minimal bottom-up holographic model without Lorentz invariance, aiming to shed light on the possible options and the related phenomenology. We find: i) A minor generalization of previous models involving a massive vector field with allowed self-couplings leads to a much more efficient emergence of Lorentz invariance than in the previous attempts. Moreover, we find that generically the larger is the UV dynamical exponent $z_{UV}$ the faster is the recovery of Lorentz symmetry in the IR. ii) We construct explicitly a holographic model with a line of fixed points, realizing different Lifshitz scaling along the line. iii) We also confirm the monotonicity of a recently proposed a-function along all our Lorentz violating RG flows.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Partition Functions and the Flat Limit of AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formulation of the S-matrix as a path integral with specified asymptotic boundary conditions naturally leads to the realization of a Carrollian partition function defined on the boundary of Minkowski space. This partition function, specified at past and future null infinity in the case of massless particles, generates Carrollian correlation functions that encode the S-matrix. We explore this connection, including the realization of symmetries, soft theorems arising from large gauge transformations, and the correspondence with standard momentum space amplitudes. This framework is also well-suited for embedding the Minkowski space S-matrix into the AdS/CFT duality in the large radius limit. In particular, we identify the AdS and Carrollian partition functions through a simple map between their respective asymptotic data, establishing a direct correspondence between the actions of symmetries on both sides. Our approach thus provides a coherent framework that ties together various topics extensively studied in recent and past literature.</description>

Abstract: We describe a general formalism based on the partial-wave decomposition to compute the iterative $s$-channel discontinuity of four-point amplitudes at any loop order. As an application, we focus on the low-energy expansions of type I and II superstring amplitudes. Besides providing new results for their leading and sub-leading logarithmic contributions beyond genus one, our approach elucidates the general structure of non-analytic threshold terms. In the case of open strings, the use of orthogonal colour projectors allows us to efficiently compute all contributions from different worldsheet topologies at a given loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the general structure of the three-point functions involving conserved higher-spin ``vector-like" supercurrents $J_{s}(z) := J_{\alpha(s) \dot{\alpha}(s)}(z)$ in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theory. Using the constraints of superconformal symmetry and superfield conservation equations, we utilise a computational approach to analyse the general structure of the three-point function $\langle J^{}_{s_{1}}(z_{1}) \, J'_{s_{2}}(z_{2}) \, J''_{s_{3}}(z_{3}) \rangle$ and provide a general classification of the results. We demonstrate that the three-point function is fixed up to $2 \min (s_{i}) + 2$ independent conserved structures, which we propose to hold for arbitrary superspins. In addition, we show that the conserved structures can be classified as parity-even or parity-odd in superspace based on their transformation properties under superinversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an exhaustive study of the interior geometry of a family of asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ hairy black holes in an analytically controllable setup. The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the setup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these backgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no inner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We then consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as Complexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we propose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by the Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan. Additionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function near the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we introduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of translational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner singularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in the latter case.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the path-integral quantisation of perturbative string theory and show equivalence between the Polyakov-type, Schild-type and Nambu-Goto-type formulations of critical type II superstring theory. Remarkably, we also find that the Minkowskian path integral realises causality in the sense that a string does not propagate between points at space-like separation, by giving careful consideration to the measure of the world-sheet metric. We also discuss matrix regularisation of the path integral for type IIB perturbative superstring theory. The obtained matrix models are the Euclidean IKKT matrix model and a modified Minkowskian IKKT model, depending on how the matrix regularisation is applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of degeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We develop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of solitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the "strip algebra", $\textrm{Str}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in terms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its action on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\mathcal{M}$. The strip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly deduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT, $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These structures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also a unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for analyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the representation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of soliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing non-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case of boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at finite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Resolution of Strong Coupling Singularities in 4d N=1 Heterotic/M-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of the moduli space of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories of gravity arising from compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string on Calabi-Yau threefolds. By studying the threshold corrections to the coupling of the heterotic gauge groups, we infer the existence of a strong coupling singularity for one of the perturbative heterotic gauge groups, which effectively yields an additional finite distance boundary of the classical scalar field space. In heterotic M-theory, this boundary maps to a domain wall solution for which the gauge coupling and the warp factor on one of the Horava-Witten 9-branes diverge, thus highlighting the gravitational origin of the classical strong coupling singularity. The divergence of the warp factor is, however, regulated once non-perturbative effects are taken into account, as we demonstrate by studying the instanton corrections to the 5d BPS domain wall equations. This regularization implies that the classical strong coupling boundary of the scalar field 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ heterotic/M-theory is resolved, indicating that, at the quantum level, the field space can be extended beyond this classical boundary.</description>

      <title>Page transition as a phase transition in approximate quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there is a huge progress in understanding the black hole information problem, and the key is that the black hole entropy of radiation should be calculated by the island formula, which describes the Page curve to ensure the unitarity of black hole evaporation. In the paper, we find that the black hole evaporation interpreted by the island formula can be understood in the language of approximate quantum error correction. Furthermore, the Page transition, as a special property of the Page curve, should be understood as the property of approximate quantum error correction itself, i.e. a general class of quantum systems under certain conditions from approximate quantum error correction can also exhibit phenomenon similar to the Page transition.</description>

      <title>Correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$ with pure NS-NS flux. We first construct physical vertex operators that correspond to long strings. Due to the GSO projection, they depend on the parity of the spectral flow parameter $w$. For a given $w$, we construct the physical operators that have the lowest space-time weights in both the NS and R sector. Then, we calculate three point correlators for each possible type of parities of spectral flows. We find that the recursion relations of correlators in the bosonic SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model can be understood from the equivalence of these superstring correlators with different picture choices. Furthermore, after carefully mapping the vertex operators to appropriate operators in the dual CFT, we find that once the fermionic contributions together with the picture changing effects are correctly taken into account, some mathematical identities of covering maps lead to the matching of the correlators of the two sides. We check this explicitly at the leading order in the conformal perturbation computation and conjecture that this remains correct to all orders.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos measures for Floquet dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.07283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically kicked Floquet systems such as the kicked rotor are a paradigmatic and illustrative simple model of chaos. For non-integrable quantum dynamics there are several diagnostic measures of the presence of (or the transition to) chaotic behaviour including the Loschmidt echo, autocorrelation function and OTOC. We analytically compute these measures in terms of the eigensystem of the unitary Floquet operator of driven quantum systems. We use these expressions to determine the time variation of the measures for the quantum kicked rotor on the torus, for the integrable as well as the chaotic case. For a simpler integrable variant of the kicked rotor, we also give a representation theoretic derivation of its dynamics.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Network: A Dual Solution for Gravitational Waves and Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that domain wall networks generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) observed as a strong common power-law process in the Data Release-2 of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We find that a broad range of parameters, specifically wall tension around $\sigma_{\textrm{DW}} \sim (29-414 , \textrm{TeV})^3$ and wall-decay temperature within $T_d \sim 20-257 , \textrm{MeV}$, can explain this phenomenon at a $68\%$ credible level. Meanwhile, the same parameters could ease the Hubble tension if particles from these domain wall networks decay into dark radiation. We establish a direct analytical relationship, $\Omega_{\textrm{GW}}(f_p,T_0) h^2 \sim \Omega_{\textrm{rad}} h^2 ( \Omega_\nu \Delta N_{\textrm{eff}})^2$, to illustrate this coincidence, underlining its importance in the underlying physics and potential applicability to a wider range of models and data. Conversely, if the common power-law process is not attributed to domain wall networks, our findings impose tight limits on the wall tension and decay temperature.</description>

      <title>A proof of a conjecture of Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa's conjecture that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed $ 3 $-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. In our previous work, the author attributed this conjecture to the holomorphy of certain rational functions by developing an asymptotic formula based on the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. However, it is challenging to prove holomorphy for general plumbed manifolds. In this paper, we address this challenge using induction on a sequence of trees obtained by repeating "pruning trees."</description>

      <title>Full Eigenstate Thermalization via Free Cumulants in Quantum Lattice Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate-Thermalization-Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as the general framework to understand quantum statistical mechanics. Only recently has the attention been paid to so-called full ETH, which accounts for higher-order correlations among matrix elements, and that can be rationalized theoretically using the language of Free Probability. In this work, we perform the first numerical investigation of the full ETH in physical many-body systems with local interactions by testing the decomposition of higher-order correlators into thermal free cumulants for local operators. We perform exact diagonalization on two classes of local non-integrable (chaotic) quantum many-body systems: spin chain Hamiltonians and Floquet brickwork unitary circuits. We show that the dynamics of four-time correlation functions are encoded in fourth-order free cumulants, as predicted by ETH. Their dependence on frequency encodes the physical properties of local many-body systems and distinguishes them from structureless, rotationally invariant ensembles of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Landau levels and their analogs with higher Chern numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landau levels are the eigenstates of a charged particle in two dimensions under a magnetic field, and are at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, which are two prototypical phenomena showing topological features. Following recent discoveries of fractional quantum Hall phases in van der Waals materials, there is a rapid progress in understanding of the precise condition under which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized. It is now understood that the key to obtaining the fractional quantum Hall phases is the energy band whose eigenstates are holomorphic functions in both real and momentum space coordinates. Landau levels are indeed examples of such energy bands with an additional special property of having flat geometrical features. In this paper, we prove that, in fact, the only energy eigenstates having holomorphic wave functions with a flat geometry are the Landau levels and their higher Chern number analogs. Since it has been known that any holomorphic eigenstates can be constructed from the ones with a flat geometry such as the Landau levels, our uniqueness proof of the Landau levels allows one to construct any possible holomorphic eigenstate with which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized.</description>

      <title>Study of the heavy quarks energy loss through medium polarization, elastic collision and radiative processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks serve as crucial probes for exploring the properties of the hot and dense medium formed in heavy-ion collision experiments. Understanding the modification of their energy as they traverse the medium is a focal point of research, with various authors extensively studying this phenomenon. This study specifically concentrates on the equilibrium phase, the quark-gluon plasma, and offers a comparative analysis of heavy quark energy loss through medium polarization, elastic collisions, and radiation. Notably, while previous studies have compared polarization loss and radiation, our work extends this by incorporating elastic collisions for a more comprehensive examination. The significance of medium polarization, particularly at low momentum, is underscored, as it has been found to contribute substantially. The formalism for energy loss and drag coefficient in each case is presented, followed by the calculation of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for a holistic comparative study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To consider the inevitable cosmic magnetic effects instead of the unknown dark sector of matter/energy on the inflation phase of the expanding universe some authors have proposed several extended exotic Einstein-Maxwell gravities which are addressed in this work. Some of these exotic models include directional interaction terms between the electromagnetic vector field and the metric tensor field. We use one of them to investigate the physical effects of interaction terms on the thermodynamic behavior of the modified Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole. We use the perturbation series method to find analytic solutions of the field equations because of the non-linearity of the field equations which cause they do not have analytic closed form solutions. We investigate possibility of the Hawking-Page and the small/large black hole phase transition and also, effects of the interaction part of the model on possibility of the coexistence of the several phases of the perturbed AdS RN black hole under consideration.</description>

      <title>Probing a Dark Sector with Collider Physics, Direct Detection, and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the complementarity between colliders, direct detection searches, and gravitational wave interferometry in probing a scenario of dark matter in the early universe. The model under consideration contains a $B-L$ gauge symmetry and a vector-like fermion which acts as the dark matter candidate. The fermion induces significant a large dark matter-nucleon scattering rate, and the $Z^\prime$ field produces clear dilepton events at colliders. Thus, direct detection experiments and colliders severely constrain the parameter space in which the correct relic density is found in agreement with the data. Nevertheless, little is known about the new scalar responsible for breaking the $B-L$ symmetry. If this breaking occurs via a first-order phase transition at a TeV scale, it could lead to gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range detectable by LISA, DECIGO, and BBO instruments. The spectrum is highly sensitive to properties of the scalar sector and gauge coupling. We show that a possible GW detection, together with information from colliders and direct detection experiments, can simultaneously pinpoint the scalar self-coupling, and narrow down the dark matter mass where a thermal relic is viable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi function $F(Z,E)$ accounts for QED corrections to beta decays that are enhanced at either small electron velocity $\beta$ or large nuclear charge $Z$. For precision applications, the Fermi function must be combined with other radiative corrections and with scale- and scheme-dependent hadronic matrix elements. We formulate the Fermi function as a field theory object and present a new factorization formula for QED radiative corrections to beta decays. We provide new results for the anomalous dimension of the corresponding effective operator complete through three loops, and resum perturbative logarithms and $\pi$-enhancements with renormalization group methods. Our results are important for tests of fundamental physics with precision beta decay and related processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the limit of large nuclear charge, $Z\gg 1$, or small lepton velocity, $\beta \ll 1$, Coulomb corrections to nuclear beta decay and related processes are enhanced as $Z\alpha/\beta$ and become large or even non-perturbative (with $\alpha$ the QED fine structure constant). We provide a constructive demonstration of factorization to all orders in perturbation theory for these processes and compute the all-orders hard and soft functions appearing in the factorization formula. We clarify the relationship between effective field theory amplitudes and historical treatments of beta decay in terms of a Fermi function.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement harvesting phenomenon for static detectors that locally interact with massless scalar fields in the cosmic string spacetime, which, though locally flat, features a conical structure defined by a deficit angle. Specifically, we analyze three detector alignments relative to the string: parallel and orthogonal alignments with detectors on the same side of the string, and an orthogonal alignment with detectors on opposite sides of the string. For the alignments on the same side of the string, we observe that the cosmic string's presence can either aid or hinder entanglement harvesting, affecting both the extent of entanglement harvested and the achievable range of interdetector separation. This effect depends on the distance between the detectors and the string and differs markedly from scenarios in a locally flat spacetime with a reflecting boundary, where the boundary invariably extends the harvesting-achievable range. Conversely, for the alignment with detectors on opposite sides of the string, we find that detectors consistently harvest more entanglement than those in a flat spacetime devoid of a cosmic string. This starkly contrasts the behavior observed with detectors on the same side. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic string expands the harvesting-achievable range for detectors in orthogonal alignment only when near the string, whereas it invariably reduces the achievable range for detectors in parallel alignment.</description>

Also, we tried to get a more comprehensible understanding of group theory by presenting examples from the nature around us to examples in mathematics and physics and using them to examine more important groups in physics such as the Lorentz group and Poincar'e group and representations It is achieved in the physical fields that are used in the quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A new 2+1 coherent spin-foam vertex for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit spin-foam amplitude for Lorentzian gravity in three dimensions, allowing for both space- and time-like boundaries. The model is based on two main requirements: that it should be structurally similar to its well-known Euclidean analog, and that geometricity should be recovered in the semiclassical regime. To this end we introduce new coherent states for space-like boundary edges, derived from the continuous series of unitary $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representations. We show that the relevant objects in the amplitude can be written in terms of the defining representation of the group, just as so happens in the Euclidean case. We derive an expression for the semiclassical amplitude at large spins, showing it relates to the Lorentzian Regge action.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Radiative Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index $n_s$, and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, consistent with the current Planck data. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass $m \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV, we obtain PBHs of around $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ with peak frequency $f$ $\sim$ $0.1$ Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show that the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be a possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis. We find the reheat temperature $T_R\lesssim5\times10^9$~GeV that explains the matter-anti-matter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Generalized eikonal identities for charged currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss QED radiative corrections to contact operators coupling two heavy fields and one light field. New eikonal identities are derived in the static limit that demonstrate the equivalence of a class of ladder graphs to an equivalent theory with a single heavy-light vertex and a background Coulomb field which communicates exclusively with the light field. We apply these new identities to nuclear beta decays and demonstrates that the "independent particle model" used by Jaus, Rasche, Sirlin \&amp; Zucchini is closely related, though not identical, to a model independent EFT calculation.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin of the Kodama vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that warped-product spacetimes such as spherically symmetric ones admit the Kodama vector. This vector provides a locally conserved current made by contraction of the Einstein tensor, even though there is no Killing vector. In addition, a quasilocal mass, Birkhoff's theorem and various properties are closely related to the Kodama vector. Recently, it is shown that the notion of the Kodama vector can be extended to three-dimensional axisymmetric spacetimes even if the spacetimes are not warped product. This implies that warped product may not be a necessary condition for a spacetime to admit the Kodama vector. We show properties of the Kodama vector originate from the conformal Killing-Yano 2-form. In particular, the well-known spacetimes that admit the Kodama vector have a closed conformal Killing-Yano 2-form. Furthermore, we show the Kodama vector provides local conserved currents for each order of the Lovelock tensor as well as the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>The $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ twisted gradient flow strong coupling without topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topology on the lattice determination of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ strong coupling renormalized via gradient flow. To deal with the topological freezing of standard local algorithms, the definition of the coupling is usually projected onto the zero topological sector. However, it is not obvious that this definition is not biased by the loss of ergodicity. We instead avoid the topological freezing using a novel algorithm, the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions. The comparison with a standard algorithm shows that, even in the case where the latter is severely frozen, one obtains the same projected coupling. Moreover, we show that the two definitions of the coupling, projected and non-projected, lead to the same flow of the renormalization scale. Our results imply that projecting the coupling does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$, as obtained through the step-scaling method.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild argued that measurements of null and timelike geodesics yield Weyl and projective connections, respectively, with compatibility in the lightlike limit giving an integrable Weyl connection. Their conclusions hold only for a 4-dim representation of the conformal connection on the null cone, and by restricting reparameterizations of timelike geodesics to yield a torsion-free, affine connection. An arbitrary connection gives greater freedom. A linear connection for the conformal symmetry of null geodesics requires the SO(4,2) representation. The enlarged class of projective transformations of timelike geodesics changes Weyl's projective curvature, and we find invariant forms of the torsion and nonmetricity, along with a new, invariant, second rank tensor field generalizing the dilatational curvature without requiring a metric. We show that either projective or conformal connections require a monotonic, twice differentiable function on a spacetime region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and gauge choices within either can reduce the geometry to the original Riemannian form. Thus, measurements of null and timelike geodesics lead to an SO(4,2) connection, with no requirement for a lightlike limit. Reduction to integrable Weyl symmetry can only follow from the field equations of a gravity theory. We show that the simplest quadratic spacetime action leads to this reduction.</description>

      <title>General Relativity from Intersection Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper combines the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity with the language of intersection theory. Because of the nature of the soft limit inherent to the post-Minkowskian expansion, the intersection-based approach is of enhanced utility in that theory compared to a generic quantum field theory. In the language of intersection theory, Feynman integrals are rephrased in terms of twisted cocycles. The intersection number is a pairing between two such cocycles and its existence allows for the direct projection onto a basis of master integrals. In this paper we use this approach to compute the second post-Minkowskian contribution to the scattering of two compact astronomical objects, getting results in agreement with previous findings.</description>

      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Possible signatures of higher dimension in thin accretion disk around brane world black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probe deeply into the characteristics of thin accretion disk surrounding black hole within the brane world paradigm. We investigate how model parameters affect the physical properties of the disk. Our findings indicate that as the tidal charge parameter inherited from the higher dimension increases, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectral cutoff frequency, the spectral luminosity, and the conversion efficiency of the disk all increase, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit decreases. Compared to cases of the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes, the disk is hotter and more luminous for positive tidal charge parameter, while it is cooler and less luminous for negative tidal charge parameter, which suggests the potential for probing possible signatures of higher dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Singularity and Power-Law Solutions in Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations with Timelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static tidal Love numbers (TLNs) of a static and spherically symmetric black hole for odd-parity metric perturbations. We describe black hole perturbations using the effective field theory (EFT), formulated on an arbitrary background with a timelike scalar profile in the context of scalar-tensor theories. In particular, we obtain a static solution for the generalized Regge-Wheeler equation order by order in a modified-gravity parameter and extract the TLNs uniquely by analytic continuation of the multipole index $\ell$ to non-integer values. For a stealth Schwarzschild black hole, the TLNs are vanishing as in the case of Schwarzschild solution in general relativity. We also study the case of Hayward black hole as an example of non-stealth background, where we find that the TLNs are non-zero (or there is a logarithmic running). This result suggests that our EFT allows for non-vanishing TLNs and can in principle leave a detectable imprint on gravitational waves from inspiralling binary systems, which opens a new window for testing gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Quantum Self-Propulsion of an Inhomogeneous Object out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we explored how quantum vacuum torque can arise: a body or nanoparticle that is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment experiences a spontaneous torque. But this requires that the body be composed of nonreciprocal material, which seems to necessitate the presence of an external influence, such as a magnetic field. Then the electric polarizability of the particle has a real part that is nonsymmetric. This effect occurs to first order in the polarizability. To that order, no self-propulsive force can arise. Here, we consider second-order effects, and show that spontaneous forces can arise in vacuum, without requiring exotic electromagnetic properties. Thermal nonequilibrium is still necessary, but the electric susceptibility of the body need only be inhomogeneous. We investigate four examples of such a body: a needle composed of distinct halves; a sphere and a ball, each hemisphere being made of a different substance; and a thin slab, each face of which is different. The results found are consistent with previous numerical investigations. Here, we take into account the skin depth of metal surfaces. We also consider the frictional forces that would cause the body to acquire a terminal velocity, which might be observable. More likely to be important is relaxation to thermal equilibrium, which can still lead to a terminal velocity that might be experimentally verifiable. A general treatment of such forces on a moving body, expressed in momentum space, is provided, which incorporates both propulsive and frictional forces. The source of the propulsive force is the nonsymmetric pattern of radiation from different parts of the body, the higher reflectivity of the metal portion playing a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and quantum chaos for periodically driven spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Q-Balls in the presence of attractive force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons in field theories whose stability is typically guaranteed by the existence of a global conserved charge. A classic realization is the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) Q-ball in a two-scalar system where a real scalar $\chi$ triggers symmetry breaking and confines a complex scalar $\Phi$ with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A quartic interaction $\kappa \chi^2|\Phi|^2$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ is usually considered to produce a nontrivial Q-ball configuration, and this repulsive force contributes to its stability. On the other hand, the attractive cubic interaction $\Lambda \chi |\Phi|^2$ is generally allowed in a renormalizable theory and could induce an instability. In this paper, we study the behavior of the Q-ball under the influence of this attractive force which has been overlooked. We find approximate Q-ball solutions in the limit of weak and moderate force couplings using the thin-wall and thick-wall approximations respectively. Our analytical results are consistent with numerical simulations and predict the parameter dependencies of the maximum charge. A crucial difference with the ordinary FLS Q-ball is the existence of the maximum charge beyond which the Q-ball solution is classically unstable. Such a limitation of the charge fundamentally affects Q-ball formation in the early Universe and could plausibly lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of Gaussian unitary ensemble and their ratio: ab initio derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent studies of many-body localization in nonintegrable quantum systems, the distribution of the ratio of two consecutive energy level spacings, $r_n=(E_{n+1}-E_n)/(E_{n}-E_{n-1})$ or $\tilde{r}_n=\min(r_n,r_n^{-1})$, has been used as a measure to quantify the chaoticity, alternative to the more conventional distribution of the level spacings, $s_n=\bar{\rho}(E_n)(E_{n+1}-E_n)$, as the former makes unnecessary the unfolding required for the latter. Based on our previous work on the Tracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions for the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings and the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices at $N\to \infty$, in terms of a system of differential equations. As a showcase of the efficacy of our results for characterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably the most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.</description>

      <title>New edge modes and corner charges for first-order symmetries of 4D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a set of noncommuting frame-translation symmetries in 4D gravity in tetrad-connection variables, which allow expressing diffeomorphisms as composite transformations. Working on the phase space level for finite regions, we pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various possible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to spinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the symmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare group $SO(1,3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In particular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more amenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra, geared toward quantum gravity applications.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is split in two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements sample comprising of 20 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements sample including 33 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These 33 measurements are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between the two samples. The distance ladder-based sample yields a best fit $H_0 = 72.8 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.51$ indicating some correlations. The one-step measurements result in $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.48$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.37$ indicating some internal tension. If two outlier measurements are removed (TDCOSMO.I-2019 known to have systematics and MCP-2020) the best fit of the one step sample reduces to $H_0 = 68.3 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.95$, fully self-consistent and consistent with sound horizon based measurements. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.0001 suggesting that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early and late-time measurements, but between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>The $g^6$ pressure of hot Yang-Mills theory: Canonical form of the integrand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present major progress towards the determination of the last missing piece for the pressure of a Yang-Mills plasma at high temperatures at order $g^6$ in the strong coupling constant. This order is of key importance due to its role in resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field theory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By systematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or momentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of Feynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a canonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000) distinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams down to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known lower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be evaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical efforts within reach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from thermal heavy scalar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>
